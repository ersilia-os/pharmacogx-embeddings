TCF7L2 gene variations significantly influence the effectiveness of antidiabetic medications by affecting insulin secretion and glucose metabolism, particularly altering responses to sulfonylureas like glipizide and potentially impacting the efficacy of metformin and repaglinide. While genetic variations in TCF7L2 are associated with modified efficacy of these drugs, the specific pharmacogenetic effects on other drugs such as hydrochlorothiazide, aspirin, and tacrolimus are less clear and still under research.
