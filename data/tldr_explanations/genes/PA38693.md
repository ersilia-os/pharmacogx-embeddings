While there are no direct and well-documented pharmacogenetic interactions of KIRREL2 with drugs, the gene's role in kidney filtration and podocyte function suggests plausible indirect interactions with drugs like hydrochlorothiazide and losartan. These drugs, which affect hypertension management and kidney function, could potentially have modified effects in the presence of KIRREL2 variations, impacting their efficacy or safety due to altered kidney mechanics, such as changes in urine output and glomerular blood flow.
