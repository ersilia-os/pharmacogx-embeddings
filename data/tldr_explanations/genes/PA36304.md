TACR3, a gene encoding for the tachykinin receptor 3, plays a crucial role in neurotransmission and hormone regulation due to its interaction with neurokinin B through a G protein-coupled receptor mechanism. Targeting TACR3 with agonists or antagonists could potentially manage pain disorders, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, or other neuroendocrine-related abnormalities by impacting neuroendocrine functions such as hormone release and pain perception.
