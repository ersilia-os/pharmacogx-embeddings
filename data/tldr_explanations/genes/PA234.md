CYP4F3, an enzyme integral to the metabolism of leukotriene B4 and drugs like benzphetamine, influences both the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these substances. It modifies the metabolic processing of drugs, potentially affecting their efficacy and side effects, and modulates responses to drugs that act on inflammatory pathways by influencing arachidonic acid metabolism. These interactions could significantly impact therapeutic outcomes, especially in individuals with variant forms of the enzyme.
