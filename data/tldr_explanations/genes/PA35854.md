SLC24A4, mainly involved in calcium transport for dental enamel formation, theoretically could interact with drugs that affect calcium levels or are used in bone and dental treatments, yet a clear pharmacogenetic relationship is unestablished. The drug salbutamol, a bronchodilator, has a potential non-pharmacokinetic interaction with SLC24A4, possibly through indirect effects on calcium signaling pathways rather than directly influencing the drug's metabolism or action.
