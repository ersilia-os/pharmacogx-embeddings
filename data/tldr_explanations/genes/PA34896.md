Volatile anesthetics like halothane and isoflurane, the muscle relaxant succinylcholine, and non-anesthetic agents such as caffeine interact with the RYR1 gene, which can lead to abnormal calcium release in individuals with certain genetic mutations. These interactions can trigger severe reactions such as malignant hyperthermia, thus necessitating genetic screening to identify at-risk patients and modify anesthesia practices to prevent life-threatening conditions.
