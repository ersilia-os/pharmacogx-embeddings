The pharmacogenetics of the KCNJ11 gene influences the effectiveness of antidiabetic drugs such as sulfonylureas (e.g., glibenclamide and gliclazide) and meglitinides (e.g., repaglinide) because these drugs act on ATP-sensitive potassium channels in pancreatic beta cells, which are regulated by KCNJ11. Genetic variations in KCNJ11 can alter how these drugs affect insulin secretion, impacting their efficacy and dosing requirements. Metformin may also interact with KCNJ11, affecting insulin secretion indirectly.
