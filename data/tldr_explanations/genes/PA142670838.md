TANC1, unknown in pharmacogenetic databases and not associated with the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties of drugs, has implications in synaptic functions and neural pathways, suggesting it might influence the effectiveness of drugs like antipsychotics or antidepressants. However, no direct drug-gene interactions have been established, and its role in influencing drug metabolism or therapeutic responses remains speculative and unconfirmed.
