Drugs like metformin, used in treating conditions such as PCOS, may indirectly influence AMHR2 activity by affecting systemic hormonal levels and potentially altering AMH signaling. This suggests that metformin could modify therapeutic responses in conditions linked to AMHR2 through changes in the hormonal environment, highlighting a pharmacodynamic interaction rather than a direct molecular interaction.
