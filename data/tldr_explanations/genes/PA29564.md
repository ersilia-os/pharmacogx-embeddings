The gene HUS1, integral to DNA repair mechanisms, may affect the effectiveness or toxicity of DNA-damaging drugs like cisplatin or other platinum-based chemotherapeutics, due to its role in managing DNA lesions through the 9-1-1 complex; however, its direct pharmacogenetic interactions with other drugs, such as the immunosuppressant mycophenolate mofetil, are less clear and need further study. Any genetic variation in HUS1 could potentially alter the efficiency of how DNA damage is managed, impacting the efficacy and side effects of these treatments.
