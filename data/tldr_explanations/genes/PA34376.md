Drugs such as leucovorin, fluorouracil, and irinotecan, used in cancer therapy, might have their efficacy or safety profiles altered due to the activity of RGS5, a gene involved in the regulation of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways. This interaction can affect drug outcomes since RGS5 influences vascular response and could alter drug delivery and efficacy at tumor sites, even though the detailed mechanisms of these effects are not fully understood.
