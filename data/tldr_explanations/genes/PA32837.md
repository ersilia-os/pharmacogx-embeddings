The pharmacogenetics of OSMR and its interaction with drugs relate primarily to OSMR's role in cytokine signaling pathways like JAK-STAT, which are important in diseases like cancer and inflammatory disorders. While direct interactions of drugs targeting OSMR are not well established, medications such as JAK inhibitors, used for conditions like myelofibrosis or rheumatoid arthritis, could theoretically be affected by OSMR functionality, potentially influencing the efficacy and safety of these treatments based on individual genetic variations in OSMR.
