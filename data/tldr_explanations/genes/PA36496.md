Variations in the THBD gene, which influences the activation of protein C, affect the efficacy of the anticoagulant warfarin by likely altering how protein C is activated, impacting warfarinâ€™s effectiveness in reducing blood clot formation. This pharmacodynamic interaction means patients with specific THBD genotypes might need tailored warfarin dosages to balance clotting and bleeding risks.
