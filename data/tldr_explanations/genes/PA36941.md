Variations in the TRDN gene, which affects calcium handling in muscle cells, can alter the efficacy and safety of beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers used to treat cardiac conditions like catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). These interactions suggest that pharmacogenetic testing for TRDN variants could be beneficial in refining treatment strategies with these drugs to enhance therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects.
