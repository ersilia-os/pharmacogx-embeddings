Drugs such as warfarin and heparin, which are involved in the coagulation cascade, may interact with the gene SERPINA5, potentially affecting their effectiveness and safety. Additionally, there is speculation that carboplatin and gemcitabine, used in cancer therapy, might interact with SERPINA5 in ways that could alter the tumor microenvironment or cancer cell sensitivity, although this requires further investigation to understand the exact pharmacogenetic interactions.
