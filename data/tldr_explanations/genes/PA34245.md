The gene RASSF1, which is often inactivated in various cancers due to hypermethylation, can affect the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs such as oxaliplatin. Although RASSF1 does not directly influence the metabolism of drugs, its inactivation alters the response to treatment by modifying how cancer cells undergo apoptosis, particularly impacting the effectiveness of drugs that promote cell death like oxaliplatin.
