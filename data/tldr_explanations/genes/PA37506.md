Methylphenidate, used to treat ADHD, may have an indirect pharmacogenetic interaction with the ZNF134 gene, which encodes a zinc finger protein involved in transcriptional regulation. This potential interaction involves modulation of gene expression that could affect neurotransmitter pathways, rather than influencing the drug's pharmacokinetics like absorption or metabolism.
