Reparixin and navarixin, which target CXCL8 receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2, aim to reduce inflammation and cancer progression by inhibiting neutrophil migration and angiogenesis. Other drugs like pazopanib, sunitinib, fluorouracil, and cyclophosphamide interact with CXCL8 pathways either indirectly through tyrosine kinase inhibition affecting signaling mechanisms or via cytotoxic effects altering CXCL8 expression or signaling, impacting inflammatory processes and angiogenesis relevant in cancer treatments.
