ADCY2 is crucial in the GPCR signaling pathway and influences various physiological and neurological functions but has no direct pharmacogenetic interactions with specific drugs. However, it may indirectly affect the efficacy or dosages of drugs targeting GPCR systems, such as dopamine agonists or antagonists, through its role in neurotransmission pathways, potentially influencing drug responses in neuropsychiatric disorder treatments.
