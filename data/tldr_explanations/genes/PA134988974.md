The drug CoQ10's effectiveness in treating conditions such as steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) is influenced by mutations in the gene COQ8B, which is involved in its biosynthesis. CoQ10 supplementation compensates for the deficient production of CoQ10 caused by these mutations, supporting mitochondrial energy production and potentially reducing oxidative stress, thus offering a targeted therapy that aligns with the metabolic and mitochondrial needs dictated by the gene's functional status.
