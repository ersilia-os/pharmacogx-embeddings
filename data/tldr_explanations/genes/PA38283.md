The gene SLC22A10 is involved in the kidney's ability to excrete various drugs and substances, influencing the pharmacokinetics of these drugs by affecting their clearance from the body. Genetic variations in SLC22A10 can alter the effectiveness and safety of drugs that are cleared renally, such as certain diuretics or antibiotics, potentially necessitating dose adjustments to avoid toxicity or ineffective treatment.
