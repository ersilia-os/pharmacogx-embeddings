The pharmacogenetic interactions between the SELE gene, which encodes E-Selectin, and drugs such as fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and capecitabine used in colorectal cancer therapy, appear to be related to pharmacodynamic processes involving inflammation rather than direct pharmacokinetic effects. Genetic variations in SELE could influence patient responses to these therapies through differences in inflammatory responses, which are significant in tumor progression and therapeutic outcomes.
