The interaction between the gene CUX2 and drugs like rifampin does not involve direct pharmacokinetic mechanisms but may affect pharmacodynamic processes, influencing how the brain responds to medication due to CUX2â€™s role in neuronal function and development. While rifampin primarily impacts drug-metabolizing enzymes and is not directly linked to neuronal pathways, its indirect effects on neurological conditions could be modified by variations in CUX2, potentially altering the effectiveness or side effects of treatments for conditions such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.
