Variations in the PRKAB2 gene, which regulates cellular metabolism and energy through AMPK, could influence the pharmacodynamics of drugs like metformin used in treating metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes by affecting drug effectiveness or toxicity. Furthermore, PRKAB2 may also impact the response to other metabolic therapies and potentially interact with antipsychotic medications like olanzapine and clozapine, which can induce metabolic side effects, thereby affecting drug responses more through pharmacodynamics than by altering metabolism or elimination.
