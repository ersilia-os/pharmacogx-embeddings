Genetic variations in the EPHX2 gene, which codes for soluble epoxide hydrolase, affect the efficacy and safety of drugs like AUDA and TPPU that are designed to inhibit this enzyme and increase epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) levels. This pharmacodynamic interaction highlights the importance of considering individual EPHX2 profiles in optimizing cardiovascular therapy to maximize benefits and minimize risks.
