Drugs like abiraterone, escitalopram, and prednisolone may interact non-pharmacokinetically with the DSE gene, which is involved in the biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate crucial for cell adhesion and tissue integrity. These interactions might occur via indirect mechanisms such as hormonal pathways in abiraterone, stress responses in connective tissues for escitalopram, and alterations in inflammation or immune modulation in connective tissues for prednisolone.
