The SEPTIN3 gene, though without direct pharmacogenetic interactions with most drugs, may indirectly influence the effects of pain management drugs like oxycodone, codeine, hydrocodone, and tramadol through its involvement in neural development and synaptic organization. These drugs, which act on opioid receptors, could have their efficacy and safety profiles altered by SEPTIN3 expression due to its high expression in brain areas related to pain perception and neuronal plasticity.
