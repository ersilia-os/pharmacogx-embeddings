Currently, there are no specific drugs or direct pharmacogenetic associations targeting the INSRR gene due to limited understanding of its functions and ligands. However, based on its structural and functional similarity to the INSR and IGF1R, which are key in metabolism and cellular growth, future research might identify relevant drug interactions for metabolic agents or growth modulators.
