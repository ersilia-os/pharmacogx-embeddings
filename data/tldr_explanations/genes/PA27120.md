The enzyme CYP4F11 is involved in the metabolism of drugs such as warfarin, aspirin, and erlotinib, influencing their effectiveness and safety by altering degradation rates, plasma levels, therapeutic efficacy, and the profile of side effects. Variations in the activity of CYP4F11 can affect how these drugs are processed in the body, thereby potentially impacting dosage requirements and risk of adverse effects.
