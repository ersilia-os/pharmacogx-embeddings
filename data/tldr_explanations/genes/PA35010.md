Variations in the SCN9A gene, which encodes the NaV1.7 sodium channel, influence pain perception and the body's response to analgesics like oxaliplatin and propofol. Oxaliplatin can cause neuropathic pain where SCN9A function modulates pain severity, while propofol's effectiveness might vary in individuals with SCN9A mutations due to changes in pain sensitivity, although there is no direct pharmacokinetic interaction with NaV1.7.
