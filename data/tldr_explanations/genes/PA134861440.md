The DDHD1 gene, involved in lipid metabolism, may indirectly influence the pharmacodynamics of medications like warfarin, which typically interacts with vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1). Variations in DDHD1 might alter lipid metabolic processes, potentially modifying the effectiveness or interaction dynamics of drugs impacting membrane composition, although direct evidence of such interactions is currently speculative and needs specific studies for confirmation.
