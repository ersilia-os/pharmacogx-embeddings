The drug rifampin may decrease the efficacy of vitamin D conversion by enhancing the metabolism of its precursors through CYP27B1, a gene responsible for the enzyme converting 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 to its active form. Meanwhile, ribavirin, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and deferasirox can modify vitamin D levels and bone health through mechanisms potentially linked to CYP27B1 activities, affecting the pharmacodynamics concerning vitamin D status.
