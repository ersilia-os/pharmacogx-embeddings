Rosuvastatin helps to reduce inflammation and cardiovascular risk by lowering C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, particularly benefiting patients with gene variants that lead to heightened CRP production. In contrast, while warfarin and fenofibrate do not directly alter CRP levels, their efficacy can be influenced by the inflammatory states associated with high CRP levels, impacting drug dynamics and lipid-profile modulation in such conditions.
