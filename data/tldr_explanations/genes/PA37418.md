Selinexor, an inhibitor targeting the XPO1 gene, treats multiple myeloma and DLBCL by blocking the nuclear export of tumor suppressor proteins and promoting apoptosis in cancer cells. In contrast, tuberculosis drugs isoniazid and rifampin affect metabolic pathways in the liver and do not have direct pharmacogenetic interactions with the XPO1 gene, although they might influence drug metabolism and systemic levels of drugs like selinexor indirectly.
