MAOA inhibitors like phenelzine and tranylcypromine increase neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine by blocking MAOA's activity, aiding in the treatment of depression and anxiety through pharmacodynamic interactions. Additionally, drugs such as SSRIs and SNRIs, though not directly interacting, may indirectly affect MAOA activity by increasing levels of these neurotransmitters, while other compounds like heroin, nicotine, primaquine, and mirtazapine might interact with MAOAâ€™s metabolic pathways variably, affecting mood and behavior.
