MACROD2, a gene involved in DNA repair and gene expression, may interact pharmacogenetically with drugs like DNA alkylating agents, topoisomerase inhibitors, and PARP inhibitors, which engage cellular mechanisms such as DNA repair and apoptosis that MACROD2 influences. While there's also speculative interaction with pain management drugs like oxycodone and hydrocodone through gene expression alteration or enzyme regulation, these interactions are yet to be confirmed through research.
