Variations in the F2R gene, which influences thrombin receptor activities, can affect the effectiveness and safety of vorapaxar, a PAR1 antagonist used to prevent thrombotic cardiovascular events by inhibiting thrombin-mediated platelet aggregation. Additionally, genetic differences in F2R may also modify how vorapaxar interacts with other antiplatelet drugs like clopidogrel and aspirin, which act through different pathways, potentially affecting the overall outcomes of antiplatelet therapies.
