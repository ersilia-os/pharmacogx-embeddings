Mutations in the SBF2 gene, associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B2, do not have direct pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs but could influence the effects of antidepressants like fluoxetine and paroxetine. These antidepressants may interact pharmacodynamically by affecting neuronal signaling and potentially impacting the neurological pathways influenced by SBF2, thus possibly affecting the symptoms or progression of neuropathies.
