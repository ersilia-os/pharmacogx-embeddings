ALDH3A1, a gene crucial in aldehyde metabolism, influences the action and side effects of disulfiram, a treatment for alcohol dependence, by affecting how the body metabolizes acetaldehyde. Although not directly proven, ALDH3A1 may also impact the metabolism and effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, potentially modifying how drug-related aldehyde products are detoxified, which is critical in managing therapeutic outcomes and side effects in cancer treatment.
