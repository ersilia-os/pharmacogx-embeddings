The IGHMBP2 gene, primarily studied in relation to spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1), does not directly interact with pharmacokinetics or dynamics of drugs such as doxorubicin, vincristine, and methotrexate, which are commonly used in chemotherapy. However, it is speculated that IGHMBP2-related pathways could indirectly influence the efficacy of these drugs in scenarios involving rapid cell proliferation or cellular stress, as these pathways might interact with broader cellular mechanisms affected by chemotherapy that target DNA and RNA processes.
