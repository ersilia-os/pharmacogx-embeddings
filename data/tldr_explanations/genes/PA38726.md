Drugs affecting ion channel functions, specifically those altering potassium or sodium dynamics, could interact with genetic variations in the KCNT2 geneâ€”a gene critical for potassium ion regulation in neurons. Such interactions are expected to impact pharmacodynamics by altering neuronal excitability and signaling pathways, which might be targeted in future therapies for disorders like epilepsy linked to neuronal excitability.
