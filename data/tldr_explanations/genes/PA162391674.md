The gene HSD17B14, which encodes an enzyme crucial for converting estrone to estradiol, affects estrogen levels and may influence the activity of drugs related to estrogen metabolism, such as hormone replacement therapies or contraceptives. Variations in HSD17B14 can potentially modify the efficacy or side effects of these drugs by altering estrogen conversion rates, leading to different pharmacokinetic responses among individuals.
