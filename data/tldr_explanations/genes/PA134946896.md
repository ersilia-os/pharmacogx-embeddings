Alterations in the gene MYOCD, which regulates cardiac and smooth muscle gene expression, could affect patient responses to cardiovascular drugs like heroin and methadone. These drugs, though primarily linked to addiction treatment and abuse, may interact with MYOCD in ways that influence heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac remodeling, potentially through modifying the expression levels or activity of MYOCD, affecting heart muscle function and structure indirectly.
