Venlafaxine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, may interact with the GABRQ gene, which encodes the theta subunit of the GABA_A receptor, crucial in inhibitory neurotransmission in the CNS. This interaction is likely pharmacodynamic, potentially influencing GABRQ's expression or function, thereby affecting therapeutic outcomes in conditions like anxiety and depression where GABAergic systems play a role.
