The drugs hydrochlorothiazide, olanzapine, anastrozole, and metformin currently show no direct pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions with the gene CSMD1. However, because CSMD1 is linked to conditions like cancer, schizophrenia, and potentially Alzheimer’s disease—which these drugs aim to manage—future investigations might reveal indirect pharmacogenetic impacts related to disease pathophysiology rather than specific drug-gene interactions.
