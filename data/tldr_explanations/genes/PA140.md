DDC gene inhibitors, such as carbidopa and benserazide, improve L-DOPA availability for Parkinson's disease treatment by preventing its peripheral conversion to dopamine, affecting drug metabolism (a pharmacokinetic interaction). Conversely, substances like cocaine and nicotine alter neurotransmitter dynamics (a pharmacodynamic interaction), influencing the dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways without affecting the metabolism or expression of the DDC enzyme directly, which can affect the therapeutic outcomes and side effects based on genetic variations in DDC.
