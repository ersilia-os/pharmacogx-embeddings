The gene FLOT1 impacts the pharmacodynamics of drugs such as carbamazepine, which is used for epilepsy and neuropathic pain, through its role in modulating neural membrane dynamics and cell signaling. Although FLOT1's effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of drugs is not well established, its involvement in cellular processes suggests potential implications for drug absorption or distribution in neural tissues.
