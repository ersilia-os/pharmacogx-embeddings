The gene PERP plays a crucial role in the p53-mediated apoptosis pathway and influences the effectiveness of cancer treatment drugs like fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide by affecting how the p53 pathway leads to apoptosis. These drugs work primarily by inducing DNA damage, and PERP, as a downstream effector of p53, can modulate the drugs' efficacy depending on its expression and function in cancer cells.
