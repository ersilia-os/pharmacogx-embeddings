SLCO4C1, a gene coding for a transporter protein in kidney cells, may affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs cleared via renal pathways, particularly organic anions such as those used in thyroid management, or structurally related to steroid conjugates or bile acids. Variations in the expression or functionality of SLCO4C1 could alter drug renal clearance, potentially impacting dosing and the risk of toxicity.
