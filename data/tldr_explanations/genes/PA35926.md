Drugs that are derivatives or analogs of amino acids may have altered absorption and distribution profiles due to variations in the SLC7A8 gene, which is a transporter involved in the uptake of neutral amino acids. This gene's role suggests that medications affecting kidney or gastrointestinal function could interact with SLC7A8, potentially impacting the pharmacokinetics of drugs reliant on these pathways.
