The gene IGF2R, which is involved in growth factor pathways, cellular growth, and apoptosis, does not demonstrate direct pharmacogenetic interactions with salbutamol, a drug that primarily affects beta-2 adrenergic receptors and is used in treating asthma and COPD. Current evidence does not support a direct pharmacogenetic connection between IGF2R and salbutamol, implying no overlapping pathways impacting drug efficacy directly related to IGF2R's function.
