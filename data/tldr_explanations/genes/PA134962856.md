GSTA5, which is involved in detoxification by catalyzing the conjugation of glutathione to compounds, plays a role in how drugs like busulfan are metabolized. Genetic variations in GSTA5 could influence the pharmacokinetics of busulfan, impacting its efficacy and toxicity, thus potentially optimizing dosing and improving therapeutic outcomes.
