ACOT7, involved in fatty acid metabolism, may indirectly influence the efficacy or safety of drugs like statins or fibrates used in treating metabolic disorders, as variants in ACOT7 could alter lipid biosynthesis or degradation â€” key pathways these drugs affect. Although there is no direct evidence of ACOT7 linked with specific drug interactions, its pivotal role in lipid metabolism suggests potential impacts on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of lipid-modulating medications.
