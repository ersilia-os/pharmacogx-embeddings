Variants in the ERCC2 gene, which is essential for nucleotide excision repair, significantly affect the efficacy and toxicity of DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents, such as platinum-based drugs like oxaliplatin. These genetic variations can alter the repair of DNA cross-links induced by these drugs, impacting therapeutic outcomes and side effects. Drugs like docetaxel, doxorubicin, and others that affect DNA integrity or replication may also interact differently based on ERCC2 gene variants, influencing their pharmacodynamics in cancer treatment.
