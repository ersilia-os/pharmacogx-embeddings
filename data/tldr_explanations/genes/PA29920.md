IRF6, the Interferon Regulatory Factor 6 gene, does not exhibit specific pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs but is crucial in developmental disorders like Van der Woude syndrome and popliteal pterygium syndrome. It primarily affects the development of craniofacial and oral structures, influencing treatment approaches in a non-drug-specific manner, such as potential choices in surgical techniques or management of wound healing.
