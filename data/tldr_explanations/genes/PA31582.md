Immunosuppressants Cyclosporine and Tacrolimus influence NFATC1 activity by inhibiting calcineurin, which prevents dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NFATC1, thus reducing IL-2 expression in T-cells and assisting in preventing graft rejection and treating autoimmune diseases. Other drugs like prednisone, methotrexate, and mycophenolic acid also suppress immune function, but their direct interactions with NFATC1 are less clearly defined compared to Cyclosporine and Tacrolimus.
