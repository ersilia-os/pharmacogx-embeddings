Risperidone, an antipsychotic medication, may interact with the gene MSANTD1, which is involved in transcriptional regulation. This interaction could potentially affect gene expression pathways relevant to the drug's pharmacodynamics, particularly those involving neurotransmitter systems targeted by risperidone, thereby influencing the drug's effectiveness or side effects profile.
