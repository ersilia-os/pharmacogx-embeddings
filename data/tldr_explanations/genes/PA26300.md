CDH4, a gene involved in neural development and tissue architecture, may indirectly affect how the drugs gemcitabine and ziprasidone behave in the body, though there is no direct evidence of an interaction. Gemcitabine might interact with CDH4 through mechanisms influencing tumor cell adhesion and migration, while ziprasidone could be impacted by CDH4's role in neural tissue organization and stability, affecting the drug's effectiveness in treating neuropsychiatric disorders.
