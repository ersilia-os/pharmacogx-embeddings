PACSIN2, involved in endocytosis and vesicle trafficking, does not directly interact with drugs like azathioprine, mercaptopurine, and methotrexate, which are metabolized through specific enzymatic processes unrelated to PACSIN2’s functions. Although PACSIN2’s role might potentially affect the cellular uptake mechanisms of biologics or large molecule treatments through endocytosis, there is no direct evidence linking these interactions to altered pharmacokinetics of the drugs mentioned.
