Despite the lack of direct evidence, the gene ANXA11 may impact pharmacological interventions indirectly due to its roles in apoptosis and vesicle trafficking; this suggests potential interactions with riluzole in ALS by modulating glutamate signaling and with corticosteroids in sarcoidosis by influencing inflammation and cellular stability pathways. However, specific pharmacogenetic connections between ANXA11 and these drugs have not been clearly established and remain speculative.
