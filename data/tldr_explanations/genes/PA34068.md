The drugs asparaginase, dexamethasone, and methotrexate may interact indirectly with the PYGL gene, which encodes liver glycogen phosphorylase involved in glycogenolysis, due to their influence on glucose metabolism. Variations in PYGL, affecting glucose production and regulation, can potentially impact the effectiveness and metabolic response of these drugs, altering their efficacy or toxicity in individuals with such genetic differences.
