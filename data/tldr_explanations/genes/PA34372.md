Variants of the RGS2 gene, which helps regulate G protein-coupled receptor signaling, influence the effectiveness of certain cardiovascular drugs, particularly beta-blockers used in treating hypertension by affecting how these drugs modify heart rate and blood vessel contraction. Additionally, RGS2 may interact with ACE inhibitors and sertraline, an antidepressant, suggesting its role in modulating both cardiovascular and psychological treatment outcomes through its effects on cell signaling pathways.
