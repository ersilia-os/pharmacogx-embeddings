The gene DOK5 is involved in insulin signaling and neural development, which may influence therapies for metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. Although DOK5's specific pharmacogenetic interactions are underexplored, its potential role in disease management through insulin pathways suggests it could affect the effectiveness or toxicity of various cancer drugs like doxorubicin and vincristine, potentially by modifying cellular signaling and systemic drug interactions.
