Although no specific drugs have been identified that directly interact with the gene ALDH3A2, which plays a significant role in lipid metabolism and detoxification of lipid byproducts, its functions could potentially influence the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of drugs related to lipid metabolism or those impacting peroxisomal functions. This indirect influence arises because mutations in ALDH3A2 may affect drug disposition or effects in conditions such as Sj√∂gren-Larsson Syndrome (SLS), suggesting a potential area for drug development or repurposing targeting metabolic pathways.
