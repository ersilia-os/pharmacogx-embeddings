STAT3 interacts pharmacodynamically with irinotecan, a drug used for colorectal cancer, potentially affecting its efficacy by influencing tumor cell survival pathways through its role in cell proliferation and apoptosis. This interaction, however, is not well-understood in terms of classical pharmacokinetic processes and lacks empirical evidence directly linking STAT3 genetic variations with irinotecan's efficacy or toxicity.
