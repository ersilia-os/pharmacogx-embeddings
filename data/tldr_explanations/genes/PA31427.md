MYT1L, implicated in neurodevelopment, potentially affects the efficacy and sensitivity of psychotropic drugs through its role in neural pathways, suggesting a modulation of drug effects like those of allopurinol, used for its neuroprotective properties. While specific pharmacokinetic interactions with MYT1L are undefined, the gene might influence pharmacodynamic interactions, impacting how drugs work in the brain, particularly in psychiatric conditions.
