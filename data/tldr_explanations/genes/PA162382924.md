CUX1's influence on cancer involves its regulation of genes related to cell proliferation and apoptosis, which affects the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs. Its dysfunction could cause drugs, especially those inducing cell cycle arrest (like taxanes) or promoting apoptosis, to become less effective, such as platinum-based compounds used in ovarian and lung cancer treatments, due to enhanced DNA repair mechanisms or disrupted cell division processes.
