Variations in the MC1R gene affect the effectiveness and side effects of drugs used in skin cancer treatments, particularly influencing the response to dacarbazine in melanoma therapy through altered drug metabolism mechanisms. Additionally, MC1R variants might impact the pharmacodynamics of the antidepressant desipramine, possibly via the gene's role in regulating inflammatory responses, although direct evidence on the mechanistic link is absent.
