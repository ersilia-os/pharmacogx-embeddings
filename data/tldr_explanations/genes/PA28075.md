The FDPS gene, essential for sterol biosynthesis, interacts pharmacogenetically with drugs like atorvastatin and zoledronate. Atorvastatin impacts FDPS indirectly by targeting upstream components of cholesterol synthesis, while zoledronate directly inhibits FDPS, affecting both bone metabolism and cancer proliferation through inhibiting protein prenylation. Bisphosphonates such as alendronate and risedronate, targeting FDPS, are used to inhibit bone resorption in the treatment of osteoporosis.
