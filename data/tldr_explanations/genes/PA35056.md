The HLA-B gene plays a crucial role in drug hypersensitivity reactions through allele-specific interactions, such as the HLA-B*57:01 allele causing severe reactions to abacavir and the HLA-B*15:02 allele being associated with severe adverse reactions to carbamazepine. These interactions, which involve the immune system's response to drug-modified peptides or the drug itself presented by the HLA-B protein, emphasize the importance of genetic testing in precision medicine to tailor drug therapy and minimize adverse reactions based on individual genetic profiles.
