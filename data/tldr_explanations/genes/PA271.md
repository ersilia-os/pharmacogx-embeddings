Drugs such as diclofenac and aspirin target the arachidonic acid pathway, where PLA2G4A plays a key role by releasing arachidonic acid, thereby affecting the pathway and helping reduce inflammation. Acetaminophen, while also used for pain relief, interacts less directly with the PLA2G4A-linked pathway compared to NSAIDs, whereas atenolol, used primarily as a beta-blocker, does not directly engage with this pathway but might have indirect effects related to inflammation and cardiovascular outcomes influenced by PLA2G4A activity. Variants in the PLA2G4A gene could alter the effectiveness of these drugs in controlling inflammation.
