PDE3B plays a significant role in managing signaling molecules like cAMP and cGMP, impacting lipid metabolism, vascular function, and insulin signaling. Although no specific drugs have been identified to directly interact with the PDE3B gene, drugs that affect these signaling pathways could indirectly influence PDE3B functions, modifying drug efficacy and safety in treating conditions such as heart failure, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Understanding genetic variations in PDE3B could help optimize drug responses in these therapeutic areas, enhancing personalized medicine in metabolic and cardiovascular disorders.
