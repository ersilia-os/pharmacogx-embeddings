PHC1, which modifies chromatin structure influencing gene expression, may interact pharmacogenetically with drugs like capecitabine, an anticancer prodrug activated in tumor tissues. Changes in PHC1 function could impact capecitabine's efficacy or toxicity by altering the expression of genes that are critical for the drug's metabolism or its targets.
