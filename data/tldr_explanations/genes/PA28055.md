FCAR, which encodes for CD89, is not directly associated with pharmacogenetic interactions with specific drugs that alter pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. However, pravastatin, a drug used for cholesterol management, may interact with FCAR in a non-pharmacokinetic manner, potentially affecting immune response modulation during cardiovascular therapies through mechanisms related to IgA interactions and inflammation, although this interaction is speculative and not well-documented.
