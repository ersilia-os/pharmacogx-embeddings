The gene SULT4A1 may potentially modulate the effects of the antipsychotic drug olanzapine, which is used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, through unknown mechanisms given SULT4A1's expression in the brain and olanzapine's central action. This interaction is speculative and based on pharmacodynamics rather than pharmacokinetics, as there is no clear evidence linking SULT4A1 with olanzapine's metabolism or elimination.
