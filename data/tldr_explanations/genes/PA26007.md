Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker used for migraine prophylaxis, has its effectiveness influenced by genetic variations in the CACNA1A gene, which encodes the alpha-1A subunit of the P/Q-type voltage-dependent calcium channel. The variations in CACNA1A affect the functionality of calcium channels, altering the pharmacodynamics of the drug and consequently impacting the therapeutic outcomes for disorders like migraine and ataxia.
