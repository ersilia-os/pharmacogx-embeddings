Etoposide, a chemotherapeutic agent, interacts with the YAP1 gene, which plays a significant role in cell proliferation and apoptosis through the Hippo signaling pathway. This interaction primarily influences the pharmacodynamics within tumor cell biology, particularly in hepatocellular and ovarian cancers, potentially affecting the drug's effectiveness or toxicity due to variations in YAP1 that may lead to altered cell cycle progression and apoptosis resistance.
