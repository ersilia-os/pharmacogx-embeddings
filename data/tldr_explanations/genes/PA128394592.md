BAHD1, a gene involved in gene regulation and chromatin remodeling, has a pharmacogenetic interaction with vincristine, a chemotherapy drug. Variations in the BAHD1 gene can alter the pharmacodynamics of vincristine, leading to different efficacy or side effects by affecting gene expression concerning inflammatory or metabolic pathways, which is significant for personalized medicine approaches.
