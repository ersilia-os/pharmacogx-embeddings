The SLCO5A1 gene, encoding a protein in the organic anion transporter family, is involved in the pharmacokinetics of drugs by influencing their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Although specific drugs directly associated with SLCO5A1 have not been identified, it's suggested that drugs handled by similar OATP transporters, like statins, antivirals, and anticancer agents, might interact with SLCO5A1, thereby affecting their effectiveness and safety through altered absorption rates or bioavailability.
