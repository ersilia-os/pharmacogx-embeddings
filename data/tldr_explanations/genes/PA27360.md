DLG5, a gene involved in maintaining epithelial cell polarity and regulating immune responses, engages in potential pharmacogenetic interactions primarily affecting the efficacy and safety of drugs used in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as corticosteroids and anti-TNF biologics. These interactions stem from DLG5's influence on immune system modulation and cell junction integrity, likely impacting drug responses through pharmacodynamic mechanisms like modulation of cellular apoptosis, rather than through alterations in drug metabolism or transport.
