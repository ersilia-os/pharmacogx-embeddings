RPL13, which is crucial for ribosomal function and protein synthesis, does not have a direct pharmacogenetic interaction with drugs. However, its role in protein production might indirectly influence the efficacy or toxicity of drugs like docetaxel and thalidomide, which are involved in targeting rapidly dividing cells and rely on protein synthesis, particularly in conditions that affect RPL13's function, leading to alterations in cellular health and growth.
