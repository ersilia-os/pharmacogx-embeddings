The PURA gene, involved in transcription regulation within neuronal development, does not typically interact pharmacogenetically with most clinical drugs due to its focus on transcription rather than drug metabolism or transport. However, drugs like Methylphenidate, used for ADHD, could have pharmacodynamic interactions with PURA, affecting neurobehavioral pathways related to its role in neural functions and development, without altering the drug's metabolism.
