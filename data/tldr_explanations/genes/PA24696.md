ALDH2 significantly influences the pharmacogenetics of drugs like nitroglycerin, chloral hydrate, and cyclophosphamide due to its role in metabolism and detoxification. The ALDH2*2 variant, which reduces enzyme activity, decreases the effectiveness of nitroglycerin in cardiovascular therapy and affects the metabolism of toxic aldehydes from chloral hydrate and cyclophosphamide, impacting both efficacy and toxicity in sedation and cancer treatments.
