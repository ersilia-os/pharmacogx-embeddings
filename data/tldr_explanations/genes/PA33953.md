The PTH1R gene, crucial for bone health and metabolism, significantly influences the effectiveness of Teriparatide, a therapy for severe osteoporosis, by varying interactions depending on individual genetic differences in the gene. Although Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid affecting bone through glucocorticoid receptors, does not directly interact with the PTH1R pathway, its indirect effects on bone metabolism might influence treatments involving PTH1R.
