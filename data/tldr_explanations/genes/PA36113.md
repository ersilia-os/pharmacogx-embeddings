Finasteride and dutasteride, which are used to treat conditions like benign prostatic hyperplasia and male pattern baldness, interact with the SRD5A2 gene, affecting their ability to inhibit the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The effectiveness and metabolism of these drugs can vary based on genetic differences in SRD5A2, influencing their clinical outcomes. Additionally, abiraterone, used for prostate cancer treatment, also interacts indirectly with SRD5A2 through its primary action on CYP17, which may affect androgen synthesis and overall treatment efficacy.
