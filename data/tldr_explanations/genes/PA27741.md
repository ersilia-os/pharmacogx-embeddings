ELAVL2, involved in regulating mRNA stability in neuronal tissues, may indirectly impact the effectiveness and side-effect profiles of drugs like clozapine, an antipsychotic used for schizophrenia. This influence occurs because ELAVL2's role in mRNA stability could affect the levels of neurotransmitters and receptors that clozapine targets in the brain, although direct evidence of ELAVL2 affecting pharmacodynamics is lacking.
