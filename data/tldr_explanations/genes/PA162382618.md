Drugs targeting the FGF pathway, like nintedanib and ponatinib, which are known to inhibit FGF receptors, might interact pharmacodynamically with CNPY4, a gene involved in regulating cellular functions through FGF signaling pathways. This interaction, although speculative without direct evidence, suggests that CNPY4 could influence the effectiveness of these drugs in therapies, particularly in cancer where FGF signaling is crucial for tumor growth and angiogenesis.
