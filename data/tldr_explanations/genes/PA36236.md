Variations in the STX4 gene, crucial for cellular glucose transport and insulin-mediated pathways, could influence the pharmacodynamics of diabetes drugs by altering glucose uptake regulation. Additionally, while the interaction of STX4 with anticoagulants like warfarin, acenocoumarol, and phenprocoumon remains speculative and unclear, it is suggested that STX4 may impact these drugs indirectly, potentially through effects on vascular or peripheral tissue responses.
