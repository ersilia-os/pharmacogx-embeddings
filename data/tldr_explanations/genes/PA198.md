Polymorphisms in the IL6 gene can alter the effectiveness and toxicity of drugs like tocilizumab and sarilumab, which specifically target IL6R to manage rheumatoid arthritis by inhibiting IL6 signaling pathways influenced by genetic variations. Other drugs such as methotrexate, tacrolimus, and aspirin may also have varied effects based on IL6 expression levels, given their roles in mediating inflammation and immune responses, pointing to a pharmacodynamic mechanism where IL6 activity influences drug efficacy and side effects in relation to genetic differences in IL6.
