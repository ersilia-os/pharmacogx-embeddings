GSTA2 plays a crucial role in the metabolism and detoxification of drugs such as acetaminophen and chemotherapeutic agents by catalyzing their conjugation with glutathione, influencing drug elimination and reducing toxicity. Polymorphisms in GSTA2 can affect the enzyme's efficiency, leading to variations in the detoxification rate, which may alter drug responses and increase toxicity risks in individuals.
