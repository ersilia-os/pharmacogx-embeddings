CBR3, an enzyme involved in metabolizing drugs by reducing carbonyl groups to alcohols, significantly influences the pharmacokinetics of the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin, altering its efficacy and toxicity due to genetic variations such as CBR3 V244M. This variation affects how different individuals process doxorubicin, potentially necessitating customized dosage adjustments. Furthermore, CBR3 might interact similarly with other chemotherapy agents like docetaxel and paclitaxel, impacting their plasma concentrations and therapeutic effects.
