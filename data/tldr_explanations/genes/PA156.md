Tamoxifen and raloxifene, which are selective estrogen receptor modulators, as well as fulvestrant (an estrogen receptor degrader) and aromatase inhibitors like anastrozole and letrozole, interact significantly with the ESR1 gene. Variations in the ESR1 gene can influence the binding, function, and overall effectiveness of these drugs, impacting their therapeutic outcomes in treatments targeting estrogen receptors, such as breast cancer and osteoporosis prevention.
