Variations in the SLC10A2 gene, which regulates bile acid absorption in the ileum, can alter the effectiveness and side effect profile of bile acid sequestrants like cholestyramine and colesevelam, used to lower cholesterol by preventing bile acid reabsorption and thus increasing cholesterol usage for bile acid synthesis. Additionally, drugs such as docetaxel and thalidomide, although not directly involved in bile acid transport, may interact more complexly with SLC10A2 through indirect effects on bile acid-related pathways, influencing their metabolism and efficacy.
