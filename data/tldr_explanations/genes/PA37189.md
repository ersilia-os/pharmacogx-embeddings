The gene UGT2B17 impacts the pharmacokinetics of drugs such as belzutifan, clopidogrel, and exemestane through its role in glucuronidation, influencing their elimination, efficacy, and potential interactions, particularly in individuals with gene variations that affect enzyme activity. This alters the drugs' absorption, metabolism, excretion, plasma concentrations, and overall effectiveness.
