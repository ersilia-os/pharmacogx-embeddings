Mutations in the SERPINC1 gene, which encodes antithrombin III, alter the dosing requirements for heparin because it relies on antithrombin III to function effectively, thereby demonstrating a pharmacodynamic interaction. Drugs such as eltrombopag, lusutrombopag, and avatrombopag, being thrombopoietin receptor agonists, could potentially impact thrombin generation associated with SERPINC1 pathways, indicating possible indirect pharmacogenetic interactions, whereas the impact of gemcitabine and carboplatin on SERPINC1, through disruptions in coagulation, remains speculative.
