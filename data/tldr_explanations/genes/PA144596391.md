RAVER2, involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation, has suggested interactions with methotrexate that could modulate the drug's therapeutic efficacy through potential pharmacodynamic mechanisms involving altered mRNA stability or expression patterns, rather than through traditional pharmacokinetic processes. The mechanism of this interaction, however, remains poorly documented and understood.
