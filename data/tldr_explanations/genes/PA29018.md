GSTA3, part of the glutathione S-transferase family, plays a critical role in detoxifying xenobiotics and drugs, particularly by enhancing the solubility and excretion of agents susceptible to conjugation with glutathione such as certain antineoplastic agents. This enzymatic activity could reduce the effectiveness of drugs like alkylating agents used in chemotherapy by accelerating their detoxification, impacting therapeutic outcomes.
