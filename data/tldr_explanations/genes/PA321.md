Variants in the SLC12A3 gene, which encodes the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter, influence the effectiveness and side effects of thiazide diuretics like hydrochlorothiazide by altering the drug's pharmacodynamic response, specifically through its inhibition of sodium and chloride reabsorption in the kidney. While primarily affecting thiazide diuretics, variations in SLC12A3 also have potential implications on the efficacy of loop diuretics, due to compensatory renal adjustments, despite these drugs acting on different parts of the renal tubule.
