Aspirin's efficacy in preventing thrombotic cardiovascular events like strokes and myocardial infarctions can be influenced by variations in the TBXA2R gene, as these variants can alter the functionality of the thromboxane A2 receptor, thereby modifying the pharmacodynamic response to the drug. This interaction highlights the importance of understanding individual genetic differences in TBXA2R to optimize antiplatelet therapy effectiveness and safety.
