Variants in the CACNA1S gene, which encodes the alpha-1S subunit of L-type calcium channels, make individuals susceptible to Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) when exposed to volatile anesthetic agents like halothane, enflurane, and others, or the muscle relaxant succinylcholine. These agents increase intracellular calcium release, potentially leading to severe reactions in those with gene variations. This highlights a pharmacodynamic interaction where the drugs influence cellular responses to calcium influx, affecting muscle function and stability.
