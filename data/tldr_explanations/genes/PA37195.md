Although UGT8 is known for its role in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis and neurological impacts, it does not have established direct pharmacogenetic interactions with specific drugs. However, UGT8's involvement in lipid metabolism and myelin formation could potentially affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs related to CNS disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, through changes in the sphingolipid composition of cell membranes, which might alter drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination.
