While there are no direct pharmacogenetic interactions of TANC2 with specific drugs yet established, it is speculated that genetic variations in TANC2 could influence the effectiveness or adverse reactions to psychotropic drugs like risperidone or aripiprazole, which are used in treating neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders and depend on synaptic modulation. This hypothesis remains speculative, necessitating further investigation.
