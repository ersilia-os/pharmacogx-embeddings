Variants in the CHRNA6 gene, which encodes the alpha-6 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, affect nicotine binding and receptor activity, influencing the pharmacodynamics of nicotine in smoking cessation therapies such as nicotine patches and gums. These genetic differences can lead to varying clinical outcomes in individuals using nicotine replacement therapies, as the effectiveness of these treatments depends on their interaction with nicotinic receptors.
