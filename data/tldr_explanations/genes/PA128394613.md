Though SYNE2 does not directly interact with vincristine pharmacokinetically, its association with diseases affecting muscular and cardiac tissues suggests that vincristine's typical pharmacodynamic effects might be altered in individuals with SYNE2 mutations. This alteration could be due to disruptions in nuclear-cytoskeletal connections, affecting vincristine's efficacy and necessitating careful monitoring during its administration in affected patients.
