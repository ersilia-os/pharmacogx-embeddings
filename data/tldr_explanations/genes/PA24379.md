ABCA4, a gene involved in retinoid transport important for vision, does not interact directly with drugs but its variations are crucial in determining the response to gene-based and targeted therapies for retinal diseases like Stargardt disease. These therapies, which include visual cycle modulators and retinoid therapies under investigation, aim to correct the functional deficits caused by ABCA4 mutations, and pharmacogenetic profiling of ABCA4 can optimize treatment strategies based on individual genetic profiles.
