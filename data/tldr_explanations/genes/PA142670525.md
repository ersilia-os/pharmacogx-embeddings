ZMAT4, involved in transcriptional regulation and other cellular processes, has a suggested but unverified impact on the metabolism of beta-blockers like metoprolol and atenolol, which are metabolized by the enzyme CYP2D6. While there's no direct evidence linking ZMAT4 to CYP2D6 activity, it is hypothesized that ZMAT4 variants might influence the pharmacokinetics of these drugs due to its role in gene expression, potentially affecting drug efficacy and safety.
