RELA's function in the NF-kappa-B signaling pathway affects the efficacy of cancer drugs such as bortezomib and gefitinib by influencing their pharmacodynamic mechanisms. Bortezomib's ability to promote cancer cell apoptosis is enhanced by its role in inhibiting proteasome activity, which indirectly increases RELA activity, while gefitinib's targeting of EGFR signaling, which may interact with NF-kappa-B pathways influenced by RELA, could alter its effects on cell survival and proliferation.
