The gene WDR24, key in autophagy and nutrient sensing, potentially affects the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel and aspirin by influencing cellular responses through its involvement in fundamental cellular processes, predominantly via pharmacodynamic mechanisms. This interaction may alter how cells respond to the antiplatelet actions of these drugs, impacting drug efficacy related to platelet aggregation and inflammatory responses without directly affecting drug metabolism or clearance.
