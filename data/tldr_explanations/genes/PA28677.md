The GHSR gene, which influences the response to synthetic agonists like anamorelin and possibly affects the efficacy and side-effect profiles of amphetamines, plays a critical role in modulating drug responses. Variants in the GHSR gene can affect individual responses to drugs by altering ghrelin signaling, which is crucial for regulating appetite and neurotransmitter pathways, thereby impacting treatments for conditions like cancer cachexia and neuropsychiatric disorders such as ADHD or narcolepsy.
