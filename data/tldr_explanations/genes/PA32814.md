SLC22A13, a transporter protein involved in the cellular uptake and removal of organic cations in the kidney and liver, may impact the pharmacokinetics of cationic drugs like metformin or certain antivirals by affecting how these drugs are absorbed, distributed, metabolized, or excreted. Genetic variants in SLC22A13 could lead to altered drug levels in the body, where reduced function might increase drug toxicity due to decreased clearance, and enhanced function could lower drug efficacy with increased clearance.
