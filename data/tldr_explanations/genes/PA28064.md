FCGR2B, a gene important in immune regulation, impacts the efficacy of rituximab—an immunomodulating monoclonal antibody used to treat autoimmune diseases and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma—through genetic variations in its expression or function. These variations influence the gene's interaction with the Fc portion of rituximab, affecting the drug's therapeutic effectiveness primarily via pharmacodynamic mechanisms related to the modulation of immune response.
