SLC22A9 is crucial in the pharmacokinetics of drugs that interact with bile acid pathways, influencing the hepatic uptake and clearance of various compounds, although specific drugs affected by this gene remain speculative due to its role in bile acid transport. Understanding the gene's effect could significantly influence therapeutic strategies and drug dosing management, particularly for drugs like statins and ursodeoxycholic acid, which are heavily involved in liver metabolism and bile acid transportation.
