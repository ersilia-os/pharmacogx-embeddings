The gene CRH is crucial in pharmacodynamic interactions related to stress and endocrine disorders, influencing how drugs like synthetic CRH used in diagnostic tests (e.g., the CRH stimulation test for adrenal insufficiency and Cushing's disease) interact with the human body by assessing HPA axis function through ACTH and cortisol release. Genetic variations in CRH can significantly alter individual responses to treatments targeting the HPA axis, particularly involving potential but not yet clinically used CRH receptor antagonists, crucial in managing psychiatric and inflammatory disorders.
