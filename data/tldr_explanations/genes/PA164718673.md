SPECC1L, primarily involved in craniofacial development, has no reported direct pharmacogenetic interactions affecting drug metabolism or response, particularly with drugs like methotrexate. Although methotrexate acts by inhibiting DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells and SPECC1L affects cell structure and organization, any relationship between methotrexate's effect and SPECC1L-related processes is currently speculative and lacks direct pharmacogenetic evidence.
