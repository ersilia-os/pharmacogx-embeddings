In treating Morquio A syndrome, the effectiveness of the drug elosulfase alfa, a recombinant form of the GALNS enzyme, is impacted by variations in the GALNS gene. These genetic differences affect how patients metabolize, respond to, and tolerate the treatment, a pharmacodynamic interaction related to the enzyme's role in degrading glycosaminoglycans that accumulate due to GALNS deficiency.
