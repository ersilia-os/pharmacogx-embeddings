The gene BDKRB1 codes for the Bradykinin Receptor B1 and is involved in inflammatory responses and pain signaling. The gene's interaction with the drug perindopril, an ACE inhibitor, is key due to its consequential effect on bradykinin pathways; inhibiting ACE causes reduced degradation of bradykinin, potentially amplifying the receptor's mediated effects including anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory responses and also increasing the risk of side effects such as angioedema.
