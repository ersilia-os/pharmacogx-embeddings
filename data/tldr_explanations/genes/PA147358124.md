Drugs that affect cellular oxidative states or are used in retinoid-based therapies may interact with the DHRS12 gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in oxidation-reduction processes and retinoid metabolism. Variations in the expression or function of DHRS12 could alter the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these drugs, potentially influencing their metabolism, effectiveness, or toxicity.
