C5orf56, a gene implicated in inflammatory and autoimmune processes, might affect the response to drugs such as hydrochlorothiazide through pharmacodynamic interactions relating to its role in inflammation, rather than through alterations in drug metabolism. These potential interactions, which are yet speculative, suggest that C5orf56 could modulate the effects of hydrochlorothiazide on blood pressure and cardiovascular health via immune modulation or inflammation.
