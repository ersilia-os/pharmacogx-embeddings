Variations in the TNFRSF10A gene influence the response to cancer therapies such as monoclonal antibodies and TRAIL mimetics that utilize TRAIL-mediated pathways to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. These pharmacodynamic interactions are crucial because the gene is directly involved in the mechanisms of drug effects through its role in cell death pathways, potentially explaining differences in treatment efficacy observed in cancer therapies targeting these pathways.
