Drugs like pazopanib, sunitinib, and regorafenib are multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors that interact with the FLT4 gene predominantly through pharmacodynamic mechanisms. By inhibiting the VEGFR-3 receptor encoded by FLT4, these drugs reduce lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis, crucial for tumor growth and vascularization, thereby enhancing treatment efficacy in cancers that involve the vascular endothelial growth factors pathway.
