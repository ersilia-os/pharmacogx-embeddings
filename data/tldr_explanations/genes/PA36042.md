SP1, a transcription factor, influences the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and receptors, affecting the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of various drugs, especially in oncology. It directly impacts the metabolism of drugs like metformin by modulating the expression of relevant enzymes or transporters, and potentially alters the efficacy of chemotherapy agents through its broad regulatory effects on gene expression in cancer cells.
