The gene C6, involved in immune response through the complement system, may influence the effectiveness of the immunosuppressive drug tacrolimus, used primarily in organ transplant recipients. Variants in C6 could lead to different patient responses to tacrolimus, particularly in how it modulates complement-driven immune responses, indicating a possible pharmacodynamic interaction beyond its traditional metabolic pathways mediated by CYP3A5 or ABCB1.
