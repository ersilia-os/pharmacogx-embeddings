Variations in the NRXN1 gene, which plays a critical role in synaptic formation and function, may influence the therapeutic effects and side effects of certain drugs through pharmacodynamic mechanisms. Specifically, duloxetine might have altered efficacy or side effects due to its interaction with synaptic neurotransmitter systems, nicotine might affect dependence or withdrawal by interacting with synaptic functions, and clozapine could be influenced in its action on neurotransmitter pathways due to changes in synapse formation linked to NRXN1 variants.
