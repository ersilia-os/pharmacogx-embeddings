The DDX53 gene, part of the DEAD box protein family involved in RNA processing, may indirectly interact with the chemotherapy drugs carboplatin and gemcitabine due to its role in RNA metabolism, which is crucial in cancer pathophysiology. While carboplatin interferes with DNA transcription and replication, possibly being affected by DDX53’s RNA processing functions, gemcitabine, which inhibits DNA synthesis causing RNA disturbances, may also see altered responses in cancer cells influenced by DDX53’s role in RNA handling; however, these interactions remain speculative without direct clinical evidence.
