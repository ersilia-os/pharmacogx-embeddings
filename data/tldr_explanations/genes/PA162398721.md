Fluorouracil and oxaliplatin, which are chemotherapeutic agents used for treating cancers such as colorectal cancer, could have altered effectiveness due to changes in PARD3B gene expression or function which impacts cell polarity and tissue architecture. This variation in drug response arises because fluorouracil inhibits DNA synthesis via thymidylate synthase, while oxaliplatin induces apoptosis through DNA adduct formation, with both processes potentially being influenced by the cellular environment shaped by PARD3B.
