SERINC5 influences HIV infectivity by impairing the virusâ€™s fusion with host cells, suggesting that variations in its function or expression could enhance the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapies. However, there is no established pharmacogenetic interaction between SERINC5 and traditionally used pharmacological agents, including meperidine, as the gene does not involve typical pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic processes with these drugs.
