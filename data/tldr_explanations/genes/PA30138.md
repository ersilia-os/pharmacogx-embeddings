KLF4, a transcription factor, influences the effectiveness of cancer treatments like cisplatin and taxanes due to its role in regulating cell cycle and apoptosis mechanisms. Chemotherapeutics that act on DNA damage response and apoptosis may have varied efficacy based on the expression levels of KLF4, indicative of its potential as a pharmacogenetic target in personalizing cancer therapy.
