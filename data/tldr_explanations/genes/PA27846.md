Drugs like Trastuzumab and Lapatinib, which primarily target ERBB2, indirectly affect ERBB3 by disrupting its ability to form heterodimers with ERBB2, essential for activating downstream signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival. Additionally, specific ERBB3 gene variants can alter the response to these drugs, illustrating the gene's significance in personalized cancer treatment, as ERBB3 also interacts with chemotherapy drugs like docetaxel and carboplatin, affecting critical cancer cell survival pathways and resistance mechanisms.
