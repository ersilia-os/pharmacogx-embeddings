Genetic variations in TLR5, which plays a role in innate immunity responses, affect the efficacy and safety of immunomodulators and treatments targeting the NF-ÎºB pathway, as well as the effectiveness of vaccines aiming to trigger an immune response. These effects are due to how these polymorphisms influence the activation of TLR5, thereby impacting cytokine production and overall immune response, which can lead to variations in treatment outcomes and vaccine efficacy based on individual genetic profiles.
