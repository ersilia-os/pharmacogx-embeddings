The pharmacogenetic interactions between the gene SPOPL and the antipsychotic drug olanzapine predominantly involve pharmacodynamic aspects, primarily through SPOPL's role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Although SPOPL does not directly interact with the metabolic pathways of olanzapine, mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes, its involvement in protein polyubiquitination and signal transduction could influence the drug's pharmacological effectiveness and side effect profile indirectly. This interaction is currently speculative and requires further study to verify.
