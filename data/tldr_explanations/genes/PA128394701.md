The SRPRB gene, which plays a key role in the translocation of proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum, does not have direct pharmacogenetic interactions with specific drugs due to its primary involvement in protein sorting rather than direct drug metabolism or therapeutic interactions. Any potential influence on drug efficacy or safety would be indirect, related more to its role in cellular homeostasis and protein trafficking rather than direct interactions with medications.
