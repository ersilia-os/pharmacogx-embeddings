MROH2A is suspected to interact pharmacogenetically with drugs like acetaminophen and erlotinib; these interactions could potentially affect drug metabolism, toxicity, therapeutic levels, and treatment outcomes through modulation of cell signaling pathways or cellular integrity. However, the evidence supporting these interactions is speculative and not yet confirmed by extensive clinical or pharmacological studies.
