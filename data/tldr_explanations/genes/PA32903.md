Variants of the PADI4 gene may influence the effectiveness of rheumatoid arthritis treatments by affecting enzyme activities that modify drug metabolism or immune responses, potentially altering the pharmacodynamics of drugs like methotrexate. This interaction occurs through changes in immune cell function or apoptosis pathways, highlighting the pharmacogenetic significance of PADI4 in modulating responses to RA medications and inflammation pathways.
