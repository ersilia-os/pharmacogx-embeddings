Palbociclib, Abemaciclib, and Ribociclib are drugs that inhibit CDK4 and CDK6, slowing cell cycle progression and reducing tumor proliferation in HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Pharmacogenetic variations in the CDK4 gene can affect the efficacy and tolerability of these inhibitors, leading to differences in drug effectiveness and adverse effect profiles among patients.
