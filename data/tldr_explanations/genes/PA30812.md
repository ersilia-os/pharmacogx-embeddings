The effectiveness of ribavirin, commonly used in Hepatitis C treatment, may be influenced by genetic variations in the MICB gene due to its role in immune modulation through interactions with the NKG2D receptor on immune cells. This interaction is critical as it could affect how immune cells respond to viral infections, potentially altering ribavirin's efficacy, which partially relies on modulating the immune response to the hepatitis C virus.
