Variations in the CCNK gene, a regulator of cell cycle and transcription, can affect the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs like fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide. This is because CCNK's role impacts DNA repair mechanisms, cell cycle progression, and response to DNA damage, thus influencing the drugs' effectiveness in cancer treatment.
