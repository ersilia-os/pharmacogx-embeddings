The MT-RNR1 gene mutation m.1555A>G heightens susceptibility to ototoxic effects from aminoglycoside antibiotics such as gentamicin and tobramycin due to increased sensitivity of the mitochondrial ribosome, leading to impaired protein synthesis in cochlear cells and increasing the risk of irreversible hearing loss. The interaction between MT-RNR1 and aminoglycosides is pharmacodynamic as it influences the drug's action on the mitochondrial ribosome, rather than affecting the drug's metabolism or disposition.
