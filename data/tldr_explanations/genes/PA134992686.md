Hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic, and atenolol, a beta-blocker, do not typically interact directly with YEATS4, which is involved in transcriptional enhancement and chromatin modification in cancer. However, there may be an indirect pharmacogenetic interaction where YEATS4 influences the efficacy and safety of these drugs through epigenetic modifications that affect broader physiological responses or signal transduction pathways related to blood pressure control.
