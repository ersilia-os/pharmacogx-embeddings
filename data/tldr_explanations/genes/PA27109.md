CYP2F1, involved mainly in metabolizing inhaled environmental pollutants like naphthalene, has limited direct interaction with common drugs but plays a role in the metabolism of certain pharmaceuticals such as imatinib due to shared metabolic pathways or competitive inhibition. Although CYP2F1 does not typically directly influence imatinib's metabolism, its interaction with similar chemical structures could alter the drug's efficacy or toxicity in individuals with specific gene variants.
