Drugs targeting AMPA receptors, such as the epilepsy treatment perampanel, may interact with the CACNG2 gene, which encodes a subunit involved in modulating calcium channels and receptor function. Variations in CACNG2 can affect the pharmacodynamics of these drugs, potentially influencing their efficacy and side effects in neurological conditions.
