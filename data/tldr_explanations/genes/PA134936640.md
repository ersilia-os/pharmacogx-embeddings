The gene ACY3, involved in detoxification and amino acid metabolism, could indirectly influence the pharmacokinetics of the beta-blockers bisoprolol and atenolol, due to its role in the conjugation and detoxification processes in the liver. Variations in ACY3 enzyme activity may lead to differences in how individuals metabolize and respond to these drugs, though direct pharmacogenetic interactions are not yet established through strong evidence.
