The ABCC11 gene, known for facilitating ATP-dependent transport across cellular membranes, significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of anticancer drugs like fluorouracil and capecitabine by varying the efficiency of drug metabolite expulsion from cells. Different ABCC11 genetic variants lead to changes in drug bioavailability and toxicity, which affects the efficacy and side effects experienced by patients, making it pivotal for customizing cancer treatment protocols.
