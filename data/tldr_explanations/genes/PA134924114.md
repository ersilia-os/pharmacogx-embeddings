The SLC9A8 gene, which encodes for Sodium/Hydrogen Exchanger 8, is involved in modulating the effectiveness and toxicity of diuretics by influencing sodium homeostasis, and could also affect the performance of acid suppressors by altering gastric pH levels. The interaction between drugs and gene variants can thus impact the pharmacodynamics, potentially modifying how drugs manage fluid balance and gastric acidity.
