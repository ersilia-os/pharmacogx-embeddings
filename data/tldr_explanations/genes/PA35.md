The ADRA2A gene plays a significant role in the pharmacogenetic interactions affecting the response to both psychiatric and cardiovascular drugs by modulating adrenergic signaling. This gene influences the effectiveness and side effects of psychostimulants like methylphenidate (used for ADHD), impacts the functioning of cardiovascular drugs such as atenolol, an adrenergic blocker, and alters responses to psychiatric medications including antipsychotics and antidepressants (e.g., ziprasidone, nortriptyline, aripiprazole, olanzapine) which affect dopamine and norepinephrine pathways critical for mood regulation and schizophrenia management.
