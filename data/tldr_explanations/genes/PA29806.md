IL19, a cytokine involved in immune and inflammatory processes, potentially affects the effectiveness and safety of drugs like tacrolimus, methotrexate, aspirin, and desflurane by modulating immune responses, thus influencing their pharmacodynamic properties. While direct drug interactions with IL19 are not clearly established, its role in cytokine signaling suggests that it might impact the actions of these drugs, particularly the immunosuppressants tacrolimus and methotrexate, and the anti-inflammatory properties of aspirin, as well as the possible immune response during surgery with desflurane.
