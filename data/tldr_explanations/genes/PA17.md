The NAT1 enzyme, which catalyzes the acetylation of various substrates, affects the metabolism and efficacy of several drugs including cotinine, thioguanine, and mesalazine. Variations in NAT1 activity influence the effectiveness and side effect profiles of these drugs by altering their metabolic pathways, which is critical for determining optimal dosages and therapeutic strategies tailored to individual genetic profiles.
