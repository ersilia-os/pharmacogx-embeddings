Variations in the RGS19 gene, which regulates G protein signaling, can influence the efficacy and action of drugs targeting G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as antihypertensive medications acting on adrenergic receptors and antipsychotics affecting dopamine receptors. This interaction highlights the potential impact of RGS19 on drug responses, particularly in treatments for conditions like hypertension and psychiatric disorders, where altered drug effectiveness and side effect profiles could result from these genetic variations.
