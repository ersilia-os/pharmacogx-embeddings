DCBLD1, a gene important for signal transduction and cell communication, is hypothesized to interact with the chemotherapy drug irinotecan, which works by inhibiting topoisomerase I. This interaction, thought to influence irinotecan's effectiveness or toxicity due to DCBLD1â€™s involvement in cellular growth and signaling, remains theoretical without direct evidence confirming its impact in clinical settings.
