GREM2, a gene involved in the BMP signaling pathway influencing cell growth and differentiation, may indirectly interact with drugs like allopurinol, which is used for treating gout through inhibiting xanthine oxidase. Variations in GREM2 could potentially alter the pharmacodynamics of allopurinol, impacting its effectiveness or safety in conditions related to abnormal cell proliferation or differentiation.
