No specific pharmacokinetic interactions between PSORS1C1 and drugs have been established; however, the gene's location suggests it may indirectly influence the pharmacodynamics of drugs like carbamazepine, phenytoin, allopurinol, gemcitabine, and carboplatin. These drugs can trigger immune-mediated reactions and adverse skin reactions where PSORS1C1's role in immune response and skin integrity could be relevant.
