The gene CPT1A, critical in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, affects the efficacy and toxicity of anticancer drugs like doxorubicin, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide through its role in cellular energetics and mitochondrial functions. Although direct pharmacokinetic interactions are not established, CPT1A's influence on cell survival, drug resistance, and apoptosis can crucially impact the pharmacodynamics of these chemotherapeutic agents, thereby affecting treatment outcomes.
