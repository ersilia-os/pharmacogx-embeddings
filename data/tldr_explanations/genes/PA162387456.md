FAM178B, a gene involved in protein-protein interactions and likely linked to immune system modulation, could potentially influence the effectiveness of immunosuppressants or immunomodulators, drugs used in treating autoimmune disorders. Variations in FAM178B may alter immune response dynamics and thereby affect the pharmacodynamics of these drugs, although empirical studies are required to confirm such interactions.
