The gene NFE2L2, which regulates antioxidant defenses, is crucial in pharmacogenetics, especially with its interactions with drugs like oltipraz and sulforaphane that boost its activation. This activation leads to increased production of detoxifying enzymes, affecting drug metabolism based on individual genetic variations of NFE2L2. Though estradiol does not directly interact with NFE2L2, it can induce oxidative stress, wherein NFE2L2 variations may alter how cells respond, thereby indirectly influencing the pharmacodynamics of estradiol. This highlights the complexity of gene-drug interactions in influencing drug efficacy and patient outcomes.
