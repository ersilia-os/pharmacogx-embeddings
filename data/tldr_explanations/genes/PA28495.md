Variants in the GABRB1 gene, which encodes a subunit of the GABA type A receptor, affect the pharmacodynamics of benzodiazepines like diazepam and alprazolam by altering the receptor's subunit composition. This alteration influences the sensitivity and response of the receptors to these drugs, potentially affecting their efficacy, dosing, and side effect profile, making pharmacogenetic testing valuable for optimizing individual treatment plans.
