SLC29A2, as an equilibrative nucleoside transporter 2 (ENT2), is essential for the pharmacokinetics of nucleoside analog drugs such as cladribine, used in treatments like hairy cell leukemia. Genetic variability in SLC29A2 can impact the absorption and elimination of these drugs, affecting their efficacy and safety by altering drug uptake and leading to varied therapeutic outcomes or adverse effects in patients.
