NEDD4L gene variants influence the effectiveness and interactions of certain cardiovascular and psychiatric drugs by altering the regulation of ion channels and receptors. For instance, variants in NEDD4L can affect the response to diuretics like amiloride, changing how sodium reabsorption is modulated, and potentially impacting treatment outcomes for drugs like hydrochlorothiazide, citalopram, and atenolol through mechanisms tied to sodium and electrolyte balance and cardiovascular ion channel regulation.
