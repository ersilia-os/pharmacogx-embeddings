No specific drugs are currently identified that directly interact with the gene ARAP2; however, it is speculated that drugs targeting angiogenesis or those used in managing endothelial functions in cardiovascular diseases might indirectly influence ARAP2 function. This is considered a pharmacodynamic interaction, where drugs affect pathways involving ARAP2, rather than altering the drug's metabolism or distribution.
