Recombinant forms of Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor (CNTF) are studied for use in treating neurodegenerative diseases like ALS and retinitis pigmentosa, with their effectiveness potentially altered by genetic variations in the CNTF gene. Additionally, the drug iloperidone, used for treating schizophrenia, might interact with CNTF pathways, hypothetically affecting neuroprotective responses or enhancing neurological side effects, although this interaction is speculative and not well-documented.
