CD19-targeted therapies like Tisagenlecleucel and Axicabtagene ciloleucel, used in CAR T-cell treatments for B cell malignancies such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, rely on its expression on B cells. The variable expression of CD19 can significantly affect the efficacy of these treatments, as different levels of CD19 on cancer cells can alter treatment responsiveness and patient prognosis.
