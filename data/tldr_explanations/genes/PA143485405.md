Methylphenidate, used to treat ADHD, may have indirect pharmacodynamic interactions with the ELP5 gene, a component of the Elongator complex involved in tRNA modification and protein synthesis. This interaction stems from ELP5's role in neural function and development, suggesting that the gene's function could modulate the drug's impact on neurotransmitter pathways and potentially influence its efficacy or patient response.
