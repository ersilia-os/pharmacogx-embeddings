CYP26C1, responsible for retinoic acid metabolism, affects the pharmacokinetics of retinoids like isotretinoin and acitretin, where its genetic variations can alter drug metabolism, influencing their efficacy and safety. Increased CYP26C1 activity might reduce the effectiveness of these drugs by speeding up their metabolism, while decreased activity could increase drug toxicity by allowing higher drug concentrations in the body, suggesting a need for personalized dosing based on CYP26C1 genotype.
