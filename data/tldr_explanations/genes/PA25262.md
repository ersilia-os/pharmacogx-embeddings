DDX39B, an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, plays a significant role in mRNA processing affecting gene expression and cellular function, particularly relevant in cancer biology. While no direct pharmacokinetic interaction between DDX39B and allopurinol is evident, the suggested link might involve indirect effects through purine metabolism and RNA synthesis in rapidly proliferating cells, like leukocytes in cancers, though this connection remains speculative without specific evidence.
