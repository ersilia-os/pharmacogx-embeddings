Variations in the EXO1 gene, which is crucial in DNA repair mechanisms, can influence the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents like fluorouracil and capecitabine, used primarily in colorectal and gastric cancers. These drugs, as thymidylate synthase inhibitors, cause DNA damage by disrupting thymidine synthesis, and EXO1 mutations can either enhance their cytotoxic effects by impeding DNA repair or increase resistance if alternative repair pathways are enhanced.
