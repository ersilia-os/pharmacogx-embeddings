CYP11B2, or aldosterone synthase, significantly influences the effectiveness of drugs like spironolactone, candesartan, benazepril, and furosemide by modulating aldosterone synthesis, which subsequently impacts their therapeutic outcomes in managing hypertension and fluid retention. Genetic variations in CYP11B2 can lead to alterations in the pharmacodynamic interactions with these medications, which can vary their efficacy and side effect profiles in treating cardiovascular conditions.
