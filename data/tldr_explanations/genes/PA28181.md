Midostaurin and gilteritinib are drugs that target FLT3 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), improving survival rates and effectiveness, particularly in cases resistant to initial treatments. Sunitinib and venetoclax, though less directly associated with FLT3, might influence treatment outcomes through multi-kinase and apoptotic pathways, respectively.
