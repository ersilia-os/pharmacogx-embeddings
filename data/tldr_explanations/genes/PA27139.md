The DAO gene, which encodes D-amino acid oxidase, plays a key role in the metabolism of drugs used in neuropsychiatric disorders by affecting metabolic pathways crucial for neurotransmission. Variability in the DAO gene affects the efficacy and side effects of antipsychotics and NMDA receptor modulators, as well as possibly influencing the pharmacodynamics of antihistamines and the pharmacokinetics of methadone.
