Sorafenib, an anti-angiogenic cancer drug, likely interacts with the EPAS1 gene, which is involved in oxygen sensing and influences new blood vessel formation in tumors through its role in forming HIF-2alpha. Variations in EPAS1 could modulate the efficacy of sorafenib by affecting tumor oxygenation and angiogenesis, potentially impacting patient response to the treatment.
