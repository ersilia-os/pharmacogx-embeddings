While there is no direct clinical evidence linking CLCC1 variants to altered drug responses, the gene's role in chloride channel activity suggests that it could hypothetically affect the pharmacodynamics of drugs like antiepileptics and anesthetics, which modulate neuronal excitability and ion channel function. This interaction remains theoretical, impacting potentially the efficacy or side effect profiles of these drugs.
