ZBTB4, a transcriptional regulator, is implicated in influencing the pharmacodynamics of cancer therapies indirectly through its role in cellular processes like DNA damage response, but it is not directly linked to altering drug metabolism or pharmacokinetics. There is no clear-known pharmacogenetic interaction between ZBTB4 and varenicline, a smoking cessation drug, indicating that any association is speculative without direct evidence linking them.
