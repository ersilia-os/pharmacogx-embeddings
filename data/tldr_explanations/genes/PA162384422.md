Variations in the EFR3A gene, though not directly linked with specific drugs, could potentially affect the efficacy and safety of drugs like clopidogrel and aspirin, which are involved in platelet activation pathways. This influence is due to EFR3A's role in lipid signaling and phosphatidylinositol signaling, critical in cellular functions including thrombosis and inflammation, which may modify the pharmacodynamic responses of these drugs.
