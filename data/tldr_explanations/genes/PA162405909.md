TMEM167A, a transmembrane protein, is suggested to interact with fluorouracil, potentially affecting the drug's efficacy or toxicity through pathways related to cellular transport or signaling. The protein's exact influence on fluorouracil remains speculative, possibly impacting the drug's pharmacodynamics by affecting cell membrane dynamics or intracellular signaling involved in cancer cell behavior.
