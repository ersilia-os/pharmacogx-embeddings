Genetic variants in the TBX21 gene, which influences Th1 cell differentiation and cytokine production, can modify the effectiveness of corticosteroids used in asthma treatment by affecting how immune cells respond to these medications, a condition described as pharmacodynamic variation. This interaction suggests that other immunomodulatory or anti-inflammatory drugs might also have varied efficacy based on TBX21 genotype, highlighting its importance for personalized medicine in immune-related conditions.
