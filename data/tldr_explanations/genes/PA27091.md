CYP19A1, or aromatase, plays a crucial role in the pharmacogenetics of drugs used in treating estrogen-dependent ailments like breast cancer by converting androgens to estrogens. Aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane target this enzyme to lower estrogen levels, whereas genetic variations in CYP19A1, like the rs4646 polymorphism, influence the efficacy and side effects of these drugs by altering the enzymeâ€™s activity or expression.
