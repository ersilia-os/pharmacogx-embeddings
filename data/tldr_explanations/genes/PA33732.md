Although the PRF1 gene, which encodes perforin-1, is not directly targeted by any drugs, its function in immune cell cytotoxic activity influences the efficacy of immunosuppressant therapies, like corticosteroids and cytotoxic drugs, used in conditions like familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 2 (FHL2) that involve immune dysfunction. These drugs help modulate the immune response potentially impacted by PRF1 dysfunction, guiding the optimization of treatment strategies for diseases associated with its mutations.
