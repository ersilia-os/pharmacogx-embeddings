AOC1, responsible for encoding diamine oxidase in histamine metabolism, affects the efficacy and safety of antihistamines by determining histamine degradation rates. Additionally, cannabidiol (CBD) has a non-pharmacokinetic interaction with AOC1, possibly influencing the gene's function indirectly, such as through immune modulation or altering its expression levels in tissues.
