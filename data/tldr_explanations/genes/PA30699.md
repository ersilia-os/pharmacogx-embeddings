The pharmacogenetic interactions of the MCOLN1 gene, which is pivotal in the pathology of Mucolipidosis type IV, are primarily theoretical and focus on managing symptoms or altering the disease course through potential gene therapy and molecular strategies aimed at correcting the defective mucolipin-1 protein. Currently, there are no established drugs that directly interact with mutations of this gene, thus making interactions theoretical and centered on investigational treatments to restore lysosomal and endosomal functions.
