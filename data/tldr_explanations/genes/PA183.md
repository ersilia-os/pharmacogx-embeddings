The GSTT1 gene influences the pharmacokinetics and detoxification of various drugs, such as isoniazid, rifampin, and multiple chemotherapeutic agents including doxorubicin and oxaliplatin, due to its role in enzymatic detoxification processes. This variation can lead to differences in drug efficacy and an increased risk of adverse effects, particularly in individuals with the null genotype that results in no enzyme expression.
