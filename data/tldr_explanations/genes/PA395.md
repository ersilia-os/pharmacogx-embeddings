ABCC5, an efflux transporter gene, influences the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of several drugs, notably altering the bioavailability and systemic toxicity of doxorubicin, a key cancer chemotherapy drug. Other drugs such as glyburide, leucovorin, cannabidiol, irinotecan, and fluorouracil are also likely affected by ABCC5's capacity to modulate drug levels, either impacting their therapeutic efficacy or altering their toxicity profile.
