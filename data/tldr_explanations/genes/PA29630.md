Ivosidenib is specifically designed to inhibit the mutant IDH1 enzyme in IDH1-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML), targeting the abnormal enzymatic activity to reduce the production of the oncogenic metabolite 2-HG and normalize cellular metabolism. The influence of IDH1 mutations on the efficacy of other drugs like metformin and venetoclax involves altered metabolic states of cancer cells, which may impact the effectiveness and dosing of these treatments, although the exact mechanisms of these interactions are not fully defined.
