AMACR indirectly influences the pharmacogenetics of drugs like cholic acid, utilized in bile acid therapy, due to its role in bile acid metabolism; drugs mimicking or derived from fatty acid structures may also be affected as AMACR is relevant in fatty acid metabolism. Variations in the AMACR gene can therefore alter the metabolic processing of these drugs, potentially impacting their efficacy and safety, especially in therapies related to lipid metabolism.
