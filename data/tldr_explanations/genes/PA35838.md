SLCO4A1, encoding for a protein within the organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATP) family, predominantly affects the pharmacokinetics of drugs by altering their absorption and excretion, particularly those that are organic anions. Although specific drug interactions are not well-defined, the transporter's role suggests it may influence the renal clearance and plasma concentrations of medications, like statins, that are substrates for similar OATP transporters, potentially altering therapeutic outcomes.
