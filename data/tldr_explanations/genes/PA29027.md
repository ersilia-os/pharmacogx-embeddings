The GSTM5 gene, which encodes the enzyme Glutathione S-transferase Mu 5, plays a significant role in detoxifying and metabolizing drugs, including the chemotherapy agent busulfan. Variations in GSTM5 can influence the pharmacokinetics of busulfan, affecting its efficacy and toxicity by altering the detoxification process.
