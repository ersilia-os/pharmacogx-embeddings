UGT2B7 is crucial in the metabolism and clearance of various drugs, including opioids like morphine and buprenorphine, antiretrovirals such as zidovudine, antiepileptics like valproic acid, cardiovascular drugs, and NSAIDs among others, influencing their efficacy, side effects, and toxicity. Genetic variability in UGT2B7 can significantly impact the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic outcomes of these drugs, which may require personalized dosing to optimize benefits and minimize adverse reactions.
