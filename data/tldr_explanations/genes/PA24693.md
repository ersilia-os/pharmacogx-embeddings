Drugs such as retinoids, used in cancer and dermatological treatments, interact with retinoic acid pathways; thus, variations in the activity of the ALDH1A2 enzyme, which is crucial for retinoic acid synthesis, could influence their therapeutic outcomes. Additionally, while drugs like hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol do not directly involve ALDH1A2, potential indirect interactions through overlapping molecular pathways with vitamin A metabolism could affect their efficacy and metabolism.
