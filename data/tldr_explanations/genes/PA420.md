UGT1A1 plays a critical role in drug metabolism primarily through glucuronidation, affecting both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. For example, the geneâ€™s variations, like UGT1A1*28, reduce the clearance of drugs such as irinotecan's active metabolite SN-38, leading to severe side effects and requiring dosage adjustments. Similarly, UGT1A1 influences the metabolism of HIV drugs like atazanavir and indinavir, impacting their effectiveness and concentration in the body. This gene also affects the metabolism of other medications such as atorvastatin, impacting treatments across various therapeutic areas like cancer and lipid management.
