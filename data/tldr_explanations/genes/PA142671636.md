The SPIDR gene, integral to DNA repair through homologous recombination repair (HRR), can influence the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs like paclitaxel, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide by modulating DNA repair mechanisms. These drugs, which damage DNA through different mechanisms such as microtubule stabilization, DNA intercalation, and DNA cross-linking, may see altered effectiveness based on the function of SPIDR, with interactions primarily affecting pharmacodynamic aspects of drug response.
