Although ASTN2 has not been directly associated with pharmacokinetic interactions with specific drugs, it may indirectly influence the effects of drugs like fentanyl, used in pain management, and isoniazid, used for tuberculosis. Fentanyl might interact with neurological pathways influenced by ASTN2's role in brain response to pain, while isoniazid could exacerbate neurological symptoms in individuals with ASTN2 mutations due to its impact on neurotransmitter levels.
