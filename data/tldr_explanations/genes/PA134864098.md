TSPAN5, a gene involved in cellular signaling and neurodevelopment, may influence the effectiveness of serotonin-modulating drugs like SSRIs or serotonin receptor antagonists due to its role in brain functions and its effect on neuron-related activities. The gene's impact seems to be more related to pharmacodynamic interactions rather than pharmacokinetics, affecting how drugs work in the body rather than how they are absorbed, distributed, metabolized, or excreted.
