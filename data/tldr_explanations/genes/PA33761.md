The PRKCB gene, which encodes for Protein Kinase C Beta, affects the pharmacodynamics of drugs such as dexmedetomidine and atenolol by altering signaling pathways in the central nervous system and cardiovascular system respectively. This can lead to variations in drug effectiveness and side effect profiles in patients, depending on their specific PRKCB gene variants.
