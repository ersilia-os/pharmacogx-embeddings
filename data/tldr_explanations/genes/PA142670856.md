SULT1A4, a gene encoding a sulfotransferase, plays a crucial role in the metabolism of drugs such as acetaminophen and morphine by facilitating their sulfonation, which enhances their solubility and excretion. Variations in the activity of SULT1A4 can affect the metabolism of these drugs, influencing both their effectiveness and the likelihood of toxicity or adverse effects.
