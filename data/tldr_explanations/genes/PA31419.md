The gene MYOM2, involved in muscle structure and contraction, indirectly influences the response to antiplatelet drugs like clopidogrel and aspirin in patients with cardiac pathologies like hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies. Although MYOM2 does not engage in pharmacokinetic interactions, mutations affecting cardiac muscle function can alter the pharmacodynamic outcomes of these medications, potentially necessitating adjustments in drug dosages or monitoring protocols due to changes in cardiac muscle integrity and function.
