The pharmacogenetic interactions involving the P2RY12 gene significantly affect the efficacy and safety of antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel and cangrelor, which inhibit the P2Y12 receptor, and potentially aspirin, despite its primary action on COX-1. Variations in P2RY12 can lead to altered receptor activity, impacting drug effectiveness in preventing platelet aggregation and necessitating adjustments in drug dosing or choice, especially highlighted by the interaction and potential effectiveness variability with these drugs.
