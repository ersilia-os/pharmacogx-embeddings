The pharmacogenetic interactions involving the PI4KA gene are crucial when addressing viral infections like hepatitis C, as the gene's kinase activity facilitates viral replication by producing phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P). Inhibitors targeting this kinase activity could potentially disrupt the viral lifecycle by reducing PI4P levels, thereby halting replication, with the drug's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics centered around the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion processes that influence and are influenced by PI4KA activity.
