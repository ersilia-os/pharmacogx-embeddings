CYP4B1, which is involved in the metabolism of fatty acids and xenobiotics, may potentially interact with drugs like docetaxel and thalidomide due to their structural similarities to fatty acids. This interaction could alter the pharmacokinetics of these drugs, affecting their efficacy and safety, although direct evidence of this is currently limited.
