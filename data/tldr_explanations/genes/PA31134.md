MSH3, a gene involved in DNA mismatch repair, affects the pharmacodynamics of anticancer drugs like methotrexate by influencing DNA repair mechanisms, which in turn can modify the drug's effectiveness. Although MSH3 does not directly metabolize methotrexate, its impact on DNA repair could alter how effectively the drug induces damage in cancer cells, thereby affecting the response to chemotherapy.
