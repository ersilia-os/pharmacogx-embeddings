Drugs such as crizotinib, lorlatinib, and entrectinib target the ROS1 receptor tyrosine kinase gene, which is associated with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These drugs effectively inhibit ROS1 kinase activity, halting tumor growth by disrupting cellular proliferation and survival pathways, especially the PI3K-AKT signaling, making the presence of ROS1 gene rearrangements a critical biomarker for the selection and success of these treatments.
