The gene GNL3, involved in cell cycle regulation and ribosome biogenesis, may influence the efficacy of chemotherapy drugs such as fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide due to its role in cellular processes like proliferation and survival. These drugs, which target DNA and RNA synthesis, may have variable effectiveness depending on GNL3 expression levels, potentially affecting tumor growth and response to treatment.
