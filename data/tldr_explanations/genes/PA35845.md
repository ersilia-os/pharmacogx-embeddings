The gene SLCO2B1, encoding the protein OATP2B1, is crucial in the pharmacokinetics of drugs such as fexofenadine, voriconazole, montelukast, and tamoxifen, where genetic variations can affect drug absorption, distribution, and excretion, leading to differences in drug efficacy and potential side effects. Additionally, SLCO2B1 influences the pharmacodynamics of drugs like rosuvastatin, impacting their effectiveness and risk of adverse effects, while subtly affecting drugs like warfarin and simvastatin through shared metabolic pathways.
