TRPV1, a gene involved in pain and heat sensation, is affected by drugs like acetaminophen, which indirectly modulates TRPV1 activity through its action on the CNS and descending serotonergic pathways. Genetic variations in TRPV1 can influence the efficacy of acetaminophen in managing pain, highlighting the role of pharmacogenetics in determining individual responses to pain treatment and the potential need for personalized medicine approaches.
