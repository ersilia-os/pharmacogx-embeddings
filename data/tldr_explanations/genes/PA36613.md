Drugs such as imatinib, used in cancer treatment, interact with the FAS gene pathwayâ€”essential in apoptosis. Variants in the FAS gene may influence the effectiveness of imatinib in inducing cancer cell death by altering the apoptotic sensitivity of tumor cells, underlining the importance of considering FAS genetic variations in treatment responses.
