The pharmacogenetic role of the SCAP gene affects the response to statins like rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, and simvastatin, which are critical in managing cholesterol by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase. Variations in the SCAP gene may influence the efficacy and safety of these drugs, as SCAP regulates the transport and activation of SREBPs, essential in cholesterol biosynthesis, potentially altering the drugs' baseline effects on cholesterol synthesis.
