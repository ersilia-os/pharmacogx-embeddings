FSIP1, known for its role in the structural organization of sperm flagella and male fertility, currently has no well-established pharmacogenetic interactions with any drugs, including aspirin. Although aspirin's effects on inflammation and blood flow suggest possible indirect impacts on reproductive health, any interaction with FSIP1 remains speculative without direct evidence or studies demonstrating a pharmacogenetic link.
