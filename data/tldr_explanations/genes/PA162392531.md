JMJD8, involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, is postulated to influence the pharmacokinetics of drugs like clopidogrel and aspirin which undergo significant processing in the liver. Changes in JMJD8 function or expression could potentially affect the bioactivation of clopidogrel, a prodrug requiring hepatic activation, and the metabolic processing of aspirin, thereby impacting their efficacy.
