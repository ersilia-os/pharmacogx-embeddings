The enzyme DHRS3 is essential for converting all-trans-retinal to all-trans-retinol, influencing the metabolism of retinoids like isotretinoin and tretinoin, which are used for acne and leukemia treatment, respectively. Variations in DHRS3 can affect the pharmacokinetics of these drugs, thereby altering their effectiveness and toxicity, which is important for dose optimization and reducing side effects in patients.
