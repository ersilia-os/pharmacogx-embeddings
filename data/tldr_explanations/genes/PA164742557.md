The SULT1C2 gene is involved in the sulfate conjugation process which increases the water solubility of drugs, aiding in their excretion. Drugs that are phenolic in nature, such as certain analgesics, antihypertensives, and anticancer drugs, may undergo enhanced metabolism by SULT1C2, potentially affecting their pharmacokinetic profiles by altering drug duration and levels within the body.
