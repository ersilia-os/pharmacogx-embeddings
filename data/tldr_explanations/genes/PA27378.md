Eteplirsen and Golodirsen are antisense oligonucleotides used in treating Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD); they work by inducing mRNA exon skipping to produce a truncated, yet functional dystrophin protein in patients with specific exon deletions in the DMD gene. Ataluren treats DMD by promoting ribosomal read-through of premature stop codons in nonsense mutation variants of the DMD gene, leading to the production of full-length, functional dystrophin protein.
