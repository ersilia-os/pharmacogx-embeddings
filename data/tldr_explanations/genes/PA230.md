Genetic variations in the LIPC gene, which influences lipid metabolism, affect the efficacy of statins such as pravastatin, simvastatin, and fluvastatin in adjusting LDL and HDL cholesterol levels, thus impacting the therapeutic outcomes in treating hypercholesterolemia. These LIPC gene polymorphisms lead to differing responses to statins, which function by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase to lower cholesterol synthesis, and possibly also affect responses to fibrates, another class of lipid-lowering drugs.
