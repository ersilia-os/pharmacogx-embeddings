Methotrexate and tacrolimus, drugs used in treating autoimmune diseases and as immunosuppressants post-transplant, interact with the FOXP3 gene, which is key in regulating immune tolerance. Methotrexate may influence FOXP3 by altering T cell proliferation and regulatory T cell activity, whereas tacrolimus could enhance the suppressive function or increase the number of regulatory T cells by inhibiting calcineurin, critical for T cell activation signaling.
