The gene TEX10 is speculated to have an indirect influence on the pharmacodynamics of duloxetine, a drug used for treating major depressive disorder, neuropathic pain, and fibromyalgia, through its role in chromosomal organization and transcriptional regulation. However, any interaction between TEX10 and duloxetine remains hypothetical and unconfirmed, lacking explicit pharmacogenetic evidence to establish a direct impact on the drug's mechanism of action or efficacy.
