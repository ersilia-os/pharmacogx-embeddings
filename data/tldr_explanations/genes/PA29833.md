Genetic variations in the IL5 gene affect the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab and reslizumab, which are drugs used to treat severe eosinophilic asthma by inhibiting IL5, reducing eosinophil activity. The genetic profile of IL5 can influence individual responses to these drugs, affecting therapeutic outcomes, dosing requirements, and the risk of side effects, underscoring the importance of pharmacogenetics in personalizing treatment based on genetic makeup.
