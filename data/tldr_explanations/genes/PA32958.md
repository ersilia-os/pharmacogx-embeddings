The PAX4 gene, which is vital for the differentiation of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells, indirectly interacts with diabetes drugs rosiglitazone and repaglinide. These drugs, which respectively increase insulin sensitivity and stimulate insulin secretion, could have altered efficacy or require different dosing in patients with variations in the PAX4 gene due to its key role in beta-cell function.
