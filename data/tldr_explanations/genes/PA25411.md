PARP inhibitors like talazoparib, rucaparib, and niraparib, specifically capitalize on BRCA1 mutations in cancer cells by targeting their impaired DNA repair mechanisms, enhancing the drugs' lethality in those cells. Additionally, drugs such as docetaxel are more effective against BRCA1-mutated cells due to their increased vulnerability to agents that induce DNA damage or disrupt cell processes, despite the interaction being non-pharmacokinetic.
