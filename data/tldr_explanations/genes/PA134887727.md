The gene NOC3L, involved in DNA replication regulation, potentially influences drug interactions with medications that impact DNA replication or repair, such as alkylating agents or topoisomerase inhibitors used in chemotherapy. NOC3L's effects on drug efficacy could vary based on its genetic variants, but it likely has no direct pharmacogenetic interaction with drugs like clopidogrel, which is primarily involved in inhibiting platelet aggregation and is metabolized by different enzymes.
