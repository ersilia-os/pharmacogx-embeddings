DSCAM, primarily involved in neural development and cell adhesion, does not directly interact with drugs metabolically but may have indirect pharmacogenetic relationships, especially in neurological conditions like autism or intellectual disabilities. The speculation extends to drugs like carboplatin and paclitaxel used in cancer treatment, suggesting that changes in DSCAM-related cell adhesion could affect the drugs' efficacy in cancer cells, impacting pharmacodynamics rather than pharmacokinetics.
