Genetic variations in the MT-ND1 gene, which is involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism, can enhance the risk of severe side effects when interacting with certain drugs. Antiretroviral drugs like Zidovudine may increase mitochondrial toxicity in individuals with MT-ND1 mutations, while aminoglycoside antibiotics such as gentamicin can exacerbate ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity due to their effect on mitochondrial protein synthesis. This highlights the pharmacodynamic interactions where drugs can worsen the impact of dysfunctional mitochondrial Complex I, particularly in tissues with high energy demands.
