Although GATA4 is a critical transcription factor in cardiac development and function, its pharmacogenetic impact primarily relates to indirect interactions that could affect the pharmacodynamics of drugs like acamprosate, warfarin, and acenocoumarol. These drugs, despite their primary uses in other therapies (such as alcohol dependence and anticoagulation), may influence cardiac conditions through pathways affected by GATA4, especially in settings of cardiac stress or remodeling, though no direct pharmacokinetic interactions with GATA4 are documented.
