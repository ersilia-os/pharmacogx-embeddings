Despite a lack of direct evidence linking ZNF613, a gene involved in DNA-binding and gene regulation, to pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions, it is speculated that it could affect the efficacy of tamoxifen, anastrozole, and letrozole. These drugs, used in treating hormone-responsive breast cancer, primarily work by inhibiting the aromatase enzyme to reduce estrogen levels, and potential interactions with ZNF613 might involve regulatory controls related to estrogen receptor functions or gene expressions associated with estrogen.
