The gene OSGEP, which plays a role in tRNA modification, potentially influences the pharmacodynamics of drugs like fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and mercaptopurine, which interfere with DNA replication, transcription, and purine synthesis, respectively. Since OSGEP affects protein synthesis, it could impact the efficacy or toxicity of these drugs, indicating a pharmacodynamic interaction rather than a direct effect on the drugs' metabolism.
