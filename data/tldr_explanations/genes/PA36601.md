Denosumab interacts pharmacogenetically with the TNFRSF11A gene by inhibiting the interaction between RANK (a product of TNFRSF11A) and RANKL, which is crucial for osteoclast development and affects bone resorption, highlighting a pharmacodynamic mechanism. Other drugs such as acetaminophen, diclofenac, risperidone, and aspirin may influence the signaling pathways related to TNFRSF11A, potentially affecting inflammatory and pain responses, although the exact interactions require further clarification.
