Dupilumab, which targets IL4R, is significantly affected by variations in the IL4 gene, impacting its efficacy in treating ailments like asthma, atopic dermatitis, and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. Meanwhile, drugs such as ribavirin, aspirin, finasteride, and sunitinib do not exhibit well-characterized direct pharmacogenetic interactions with IL4, though ribavirin and aspirin might indirectly interact due to their roles in immune modulation.
