There are no direct pharmacogenetic interactions between TEX12, a gene involved in sperm development, and clinical drugs such as ribavirin or tacrolimus, based on existing evidence. The connections between TEX12 and these drugs, which serve different primary functions (ribavirin for viral infections and tacrolimus as an immunosuppressant), likely stem from non-direct, non-pharmacokinetic interactions possibly related to effects on overall cell health that could indirectly impact cells expressing TEX12, such as sperm cells.
