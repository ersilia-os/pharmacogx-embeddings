RIMS1, which plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter release and synaptic function, is implicated in pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs influencing neurotransmitter systems, such as quetiapine. Quetiapine, by impacting RIMS1-mediated pathways, may see altered efficacy or side effect profiles, due to its effects on synaptic transmission, particularly in brain areas relevant to mood and cognition. This interaction is pharmacodynamic, focusing on the drugâ€™s effect on neurotransmitter systems rather than on metabolism or distribution.
