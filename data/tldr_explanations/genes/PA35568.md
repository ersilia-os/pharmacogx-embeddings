CXCL10 plays a significant role in the pharmacodynamics of disease progression and treatment response, particularly in conditions like multiple sclerosis, hepatitis C, and certain cancers. Elevated CXCL10 levels are associated with a poor response to antiviral therapy, specifically pegylated interferon and ribavirin in chronic hepatitis C, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and future target for modulating immune responses in these diseases.
