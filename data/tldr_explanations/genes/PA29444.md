Drugs like trametinib, encorafenib, dabrafenib, and vemurafenib, although not directly targeting HRAS, indirectly affect its activity by modulating the MAPK pathway in cancers with HRAS mutations. Trametinib inhibits MEK downstream of HRAS, while the latter three drugs, primarily for BRAF-mutated cancers, also modulate the same pathway, changing the signal transduction in cancer cells and impacting cancer growth and survival.
