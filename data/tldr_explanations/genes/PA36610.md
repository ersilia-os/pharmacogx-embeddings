Variations in the TNFRSF1B gene, such as the rs1061622 polymorphism, influence how effectively drugs like infliximab and etanercept, which target TNF-alpha, can bind and inhibit TNF-alpha. This affects the efficacy and safety of these treatments for autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Although TNFRSF1B also potentially interacts with non-TNF targeting drugs such as morphine through its broad effects on the immune system, this interaction is indirect and less clearly understood.
