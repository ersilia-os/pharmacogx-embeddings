SLC1A4, an amino acid transporter gene, plays a significant role in influencing the pharmacodynamics of neurological drugs by altering neurotransmitter precursor availability such as alanine, serine, and cysteine. This can impact the effectiveness of drugs used to treat conditions like schizophrenia or epilepsy due to modifications in neurotransmitter balance, and also affect the safety and efficacy of treatments for amino acid metabolism disorders by influencing drug metabolic interactions.
