Variants in the CHRNB2 gene, which encodes the beta-2 subunit of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, may influence the efficacy and side effects of drugs like varenicline, bupropion, and nicotineâ€”all of which interact with these receptors. These interactions suggest a need for personalized treatment strategies in smoking cessation and potentially epilepsy management, depending on individual CHRNB2 genotypes.
