GSTP1 significantly influences the pharmacogenetics and resultant efficacy of various drugs by modifying their metabolism and toxicity, as seen in drugs like oxaliplatin, thiotepa, olanzapine, and cyclophosphamide through enzymatic detoxification processes such as glutathione conjugation. Additionally, GSTP1 impacts the resistance mechanisms to chemotherapy drugs such as doxorubicin, epirubicin, and irinotecan, potentially reducing their effectiveness, while also affecting the efficacy and safety of drugs in other therapeutic areas like anesthesia and immunosuppression.
