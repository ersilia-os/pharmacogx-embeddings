Certain medications exacerbate hemolysis in individuals with G6PD deficiency due to their effects on oxidative stress and redox balance within cells. Notably, antimalarials like primaquine and chloroquine, antibiotics such as dapsone, sulfasalazine, and sulfamethoxazole, NSAIDs including aspirin and ibuprofen, and potentially diabetic medications like gliclazide and glimepiride, as well as anticoagulants such as warfarin, can precipitate hemolytic reactions, necessitating careful management to avoid these drugs in affected individuals.
