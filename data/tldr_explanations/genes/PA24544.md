Emerging interests in pharmacogenetics suggest that the gene ADAMTS18 may affect the efficacy or toxicity of the drug sorafenib, a kinase inhibitor used for treating renal and liver cancers, through non-pharmacokinetic interactions involving tumor suppression and metastasis inhibition. Sorafenib targets multiple kinases impacting tumor growth and vascularization, and it is believed that it might interact with ADAMTS18-regulated pathways influencing the extracellular matrix and cell migration.
