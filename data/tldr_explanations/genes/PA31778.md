NRG3, which affects neural and cardiac development by interacting with ERBB4, indirectly influences the pharmacogenetics of psychiatric drugs such as iloperidone used in schizophrenia by modulating ERBB4 signaling, potentially impacting drug efficacy and patient response. In contrast, the connection between NRG3 and the impact on drugs like carboplatin and paclitaxel, mainly used in cancer therapy, is less clear due to their lack of direct interaction with ERBB4 or associated pathways, suggesting a more tangential influence on cellular responses in neural tissues.
