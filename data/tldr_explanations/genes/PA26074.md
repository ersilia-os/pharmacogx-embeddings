Variations in the NOD2 gene affect the effectiveness of medications for treating Crohnâ€™s disease, leading to reduced responses to corticosteroids and anti-TNF agents via pharmacodynamic interactions involving altered immune pathways. Additionally, NOD2 mutations are inferred to potentially alter the effectiveness of the immunosuppressant tacrolimus, a drug which primary mechanism involves inhibiting T-cell activation, suggesting that these gene variants could affect the suppression of inflammatory responses in autoimmune conditions.
