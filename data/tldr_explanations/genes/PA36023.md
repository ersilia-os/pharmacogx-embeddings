Statins, which are used to lower cholesterol levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, indirectly affect the SORT1 pathway involved in lipid metabolism. Variations in the SORT1 gene can influence individual responses to statin therapy, which impacts both the efficacy of the drug and the risk of side effects, suggesting that genetic screening for SORT1 variants could help in personalizing treatment plans.
