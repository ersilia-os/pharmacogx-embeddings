Variations in the FOLR3 gene, which aids in the transport and uptake of folate, could impact the effectiveness or toxicity of pemetrexed, a chemotherapy drug that targets folate pathways. Since FOLR3 is involved in folate transportation, genetic differences might affect how drugs like pemetrexed are absorbed and utilized within the body, influencing both the efficacy and safety of the drug primarily through pharmacokinetics.
