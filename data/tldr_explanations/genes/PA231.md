Lonafarnib, a farnesyltransferase inhibitor used in the management of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, a type of laminopathy, interacts with the LMNA gene by inhibiting farnesylation of prelamin A. This interaction modifies the disease phenotype associated with LMNA mutations, demonstrating a pharmacodynamic mechanism without significantly altering the drug's pharmacokinetics in relation to LMNA variants.
