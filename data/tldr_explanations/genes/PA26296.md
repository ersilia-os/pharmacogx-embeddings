CDH23, which plays a role in cellular adhesion in auditory and visual systems, has no confirmed direct pharmacogenetic interactions with common drugs, including methylphenidate. Though methylphenidate is used for ADHD and does not influence inner ear or visual mechanotransduction processes, it might be considered for managing cognitive and behavioral symptoms in patients with CDH23-related sensory impairments; however, this connection is speculative and lacks a direct pharmacogenetic mechanism.
