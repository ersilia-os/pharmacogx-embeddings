EXOC4, involved in vesicle trafficking, indirectly influences drug efficacy and safety due to its role in the exocytosis of post-Golgi vesicles, which can affect the absorption and intracellular concentrations of drugs. Although no direct interactions with specific drugs are established, the gene's functionality could impact the pharmacokinetics of drugs used in treating neurological conditions or metabolic disorders, such as diabetes, by affecting secretion mechanisms and neurotransmitter levels.
