Variations in the ASIC2 gene, which plays a critical role in pain perception by modulating the properties of ion channels, could influence the efficacy of analgesic and anti-inflammatory medications. This suggests that ASIC2 might impact the pharmacodynamics of these drugs, thereby affecting their effectiveness in managing pain and inflammation based on individual genetic differences.
