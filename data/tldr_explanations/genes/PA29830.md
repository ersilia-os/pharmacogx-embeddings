The pharmacogenetics of the IL3 gene, known for its role in hematopoiesis and immune response, reveals that while IL3 itself is not directly targeted by drugs, its interaction with tacrolimus, an immunosuppressive drug, is notable. Tacrolimus may affect the IL3-mediated pathways, altering immune responses and potentially influencing the drug's efficacy or toxicity, necessitating adjustments in dosage or monitoring based on different expressions or functions of the IL3 gene in patients.
