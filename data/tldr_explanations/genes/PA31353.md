The gene MYC significantly impacts the efficacy of cancer therapies such as cisplatin and doxorubicin through pharmacodynamic interactions, often leading to drug resistance by influencing DNA repair and apoptosis pathways. While MYC is also mentioned in relation to the anticoagulant warfarin, this association is speculative and mainly indirect, as MYC primarily affects pathways related to cellular proliferation and cancer pathogenesis rather than coagulation.
