The ABCC8 gene impacts the efficacious use of several diabetes drugs by affecting ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channels in pancreatic beta cells, altering insulin secretion. Sulfonylureas such as glibenclamide and glipizide directly interact with these channels to stimulate insulin release, while other drugs like metformin and repaglinide may have indirect interactions affecting their efficacy, primarily through pharmacodynamic mechanisms involving these K-ATP channels. Variations in ABCC8 may modify drug sensitivity, influencing both efficacy and adverse effects like hypoglycemia.
