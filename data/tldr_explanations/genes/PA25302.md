Venetoclax targets the BCL2 gene to induce apoptosis in cancer cells by disrupting its interaction with proteins like BIM, which is vital for treating cancers such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Other drugs like docetaxel, carboplatin, ribavirin, and paclitaxel, although not directly targeting BCL2, interact with apoptosis pathways potentially influenced by BCL2, where docetaxel and paclitaxel can block cell division, carboplatin causes DNA damage leading to apoptosis, and ribavirin has effects that might modify BCL2's role in immune cells.
