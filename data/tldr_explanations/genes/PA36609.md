Drugs like infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept, which target TNF-α to treat autoimmune conditions, interact variably with the TNFRSF1A gene; changes in this gene can affect how well these drugs work by altering the TNFRSF1A receptor's ability to bind TNF-α. Genetic variations in TNFRSF1A can therefore predict a patient's responsiveness or resistance to these TNF inhibitors, underscoring the value of genetic testing in personalizing treatment approaches.
