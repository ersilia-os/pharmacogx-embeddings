The transcription factor gene FOXC1 may interact with drugs used in treating glaucoma, such as beta blockers and prostaglandin analogs, potentially affecting their efficacy or safety due to its role in disease pathways related to eye disorders. Additionally, genetic variations in FOXC1 could influence the effectiveness or toxicity of the chemotherapeutic agent oxaliplatin, possibly through its impact on tumor biology or pathways like DNA repair, which are affected by transcription factors.
