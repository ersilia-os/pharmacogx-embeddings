MAN1B1, which is involved in the removal of mannose residues from glycoproteins, may affect the efficacy or stability of drugs like daunorubicin, used in chemotherapy. This effect is not via traditional pharmacokinetic pathways such as liver enzyme metabolism but through its role in glycoprotein processing which influences cellular homeostasis and protein quality control.
