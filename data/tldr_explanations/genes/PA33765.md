Drugs such as sorafenib in cancer therapy and cholinesterase inhibitors like rivastigmine, used in Alzheimer's disease, along with antipsychotic perphenazine, interact pharmacodynamically with PRKCE due to its role in critical cellular signaling pathways like PI3K/Akt. These interactions with PRKCE can influence the effects of these drugs by impacting cell proliferation and survival, thus potentially altering their therapeutic efficacy and resistance profiles.
