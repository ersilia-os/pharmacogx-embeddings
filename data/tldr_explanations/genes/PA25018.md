Although specific pharmacogenetic interactions involving the ARVCF gene have not been definitively identified, its role in the cadherin and Wnt signaling pathways theoretically suggests that drugs like morphine, heroin, bupropion, and risperidone could interact with ARVCF by influencing cell signaling and adhesion, which are crucial for neuronal function. Variations in ARVCF may alter the efficacy or side effects of these drugs.
