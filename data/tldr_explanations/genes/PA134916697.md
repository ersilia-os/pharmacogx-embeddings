Variations in the RFK gene, which affects the metabolism of vitamin B2 into flavins like FMN and FAD, can potentially impact the efficacy and toxicity of SSRIs such as citalopram and escitalopram by altering mitochondrial and cellular energy metabolism. This interaction, primarily related to pharmacodynamics, suggests that changes in flavin levels could influence how these antidepressant drugs act or are tolerated, particularly in the central nervous system.
