The pharmacogenetics of CHST8, which involves the sulfation of carbohydrate groups in glycoproteins and glycolipids, may indirectly influence the pharmacokinetics of drugs that undergo sulfoconjugation for their metabolism or bioactivation. Although specific drugs are not detailed, CHST8 could affect the function of drugs interacting with glycosaminoglycan components of the extracellular matrix, potentially impacting their absorption, distribution, or elimination, particularly in the context of diseases like inflammatory bowel diseases.
