SKOR2, a gene involved in neural development, has a speculated but not well-established pharmacogenetic interaction with perphenazine, a drug affecting neurotransmitter pathways. This interaction is primarily theoretical and focused on potential pharmacodynamic effects due to SKOR2's role in neurological functions, though specific mechanisms are not detailed in the literature.
