The ADH4 gene encodes an enzyme involved in metabolizing alcohol to acetaldehyde, and its genetic variations can affect this process, thereby influencing the efficacy and safety of drugs like disulfiram and naltrexone used in treating alcohol-related conditions. Disulfiram works by increasing acetaldehyde levels to deter alcohol consumption, whereas naltrexone reduces cravings and consumption, both potentially affected by the rate of alcohol metabolism driven by different ADH4 gene variants.
