Drugs involved in managing hyperphosphatemia and chronic kidney disease (CKD) may interact pharmacogenetically with the KL gene, which encodes Klotho protein, influencing the expression of Klotho or its interaction with fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). Such interactions, particularly with therapies like phosphate binders or vitamin D analogs, could impact the regulation of phosphate and calcium homeostasis, thus affecting drug effectiveness and safety in conditions like osteoporosis or CKD.
