The FMO4 gene encodes for the enzyme flavin-containing monooxygenase 4, which potentially contributes to the metabolism of drugs by affecting their pharmacokinetics, altering plasma drug levels, and impacting therapeutic outcomes or side effects. The exact drugs impacted by FMO4 are still speculative, as FMO4â€™s interactions with specific drugs are currently not well-documented and remain under research.
