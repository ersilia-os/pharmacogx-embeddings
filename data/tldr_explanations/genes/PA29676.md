The pharmacogenetic interactions of IFNGR2 are significant due to its role in the interferon gamma (IFN-γ) receptor, affecting responses to immunomodulatory drugs that utilize or act through the IFN-γ pathway. These interactions are pharmacodynamic, involving IFNGR2 in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, where genetic variations in IFNGR2 can influence the effectiveness and safety of treatments, such as synthetic or recombinant IFN-γ used in infections or immune disorders.
