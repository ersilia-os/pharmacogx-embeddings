SLC6A5 encodes the glycine transporter 2 and is involved in inhibitory neurotransmission in the CNS by modulating glycine reuptake. While there is no direct pharmacogenetic interaction with haloperidol, a drug antagonizing dopamine D2 receptors, the modulation of neurotransmitter systems by haloperidol can indirectly affect glycine transport and balance via altered neurotransmitter levels, highlighting a systemic impact on neurotransmission rather than a direct genetic interaction.
