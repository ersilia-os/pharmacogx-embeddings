The INVS gene, which influences the development and function of cilia and impacts cellular signaling in renal cells, potentially affects the pharmacodynamics of drugs like duloxetine. Duloxetine, an antidepressant, might impact renal function through systemic effects that indirectly influence pathways related to INVS, although direct pharmacokinetic interactions with INVS are not clear.
