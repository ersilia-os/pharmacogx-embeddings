ADAMTS10, a gene involved in the cleavage of extracellular matrix components, does not specifically interact with common drugs but may have a theoretical pharmacodynamic interaction with levonorgestrel, a synthetic progestogen. This potential interaction could involve levonorgestrel influencing the extracellular matrix in tissues where ADAMTS10 is active, which might affect the drug's disposition or efficacy, particularly in patients with connective tissue disorders.
