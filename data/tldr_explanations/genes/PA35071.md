The HLA-DRA gene, though not directly interacting with drugs through pharmacokinetic pathways, plays an indirect role in pharmacodynamics due to its involvement in the immune system. It is implicated in the immune-mediated drug reactions, such as hypersensitivities to antibiotics like amoxicillin, flucloxacillin, and clavulanate, possibly by affecting how drug-related antigens are presented to the immune system by antigen-presenting cells, thereby influencing the likelihood or severity of allergic reactions.
