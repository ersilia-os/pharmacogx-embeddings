Genetic variations in the PEAR1 gene affect the effectiveness of antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel, aspirin, and prasugrel, which are critical in reducing platelet aggregation to prevent thrombotic events in cardiovascular disease. Specific PEAR1 polymorphisms can lead to differing platelet reactivity, suggesting the need for personalized dose adjustments to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects like bleeding risks. Additionally, PEAR1â€™s interaction with epinephrine also plays a role in modulating platelet activation, influencing the pharmacodynamic responses to cardiovascular therapies involving epinephrine.
