The gene UMPS significantly affects the action and effectiveness of oncological and antiviral drugs such as fluorouracil, tegafur, capecitabine, and leucovorin by influencing their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. For instance, UMPS activates fluorouracil and its prodrugs into metabolites that disrupt DNA synthesis, particularly by converting 5-FU into 5-fluoro-UMP which inhibits thymidylate synthase, crucial for DNA replication in cancer cells; additionally, leucovorin enhances these effects by stabilizing the complex with thymidylate synthase. This relationship highlights the importance of considering UMPS activity in tailoring treatment plans.
