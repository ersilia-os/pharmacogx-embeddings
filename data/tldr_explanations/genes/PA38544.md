Alterations in the ZDHHC3 gene, which influences protein palmitoylation and localization within cell membranes, could potentially impact the effectiveness of clopidogrel and aspirin by modifying the signaling pathways and enzyme functions these drugs target. While there are no direct pharmacogenetic interactions documented, the gene's role in protein trafficking might indirectly affect the pathways crucial for the activation of clopidogrel and the function of cyclooxygenase inhibited by aspirin.
