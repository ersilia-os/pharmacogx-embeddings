The gene RNF8, which encodes a ubiquitin ligase important for DNA repair, plays a critical role in determining the effectiveness and toxicity of chemotherapy drugs like docetaxel and carboplatin by affecting how cells repair the DNA damage these drugs cause. Variations in the RNF8 gene can lead to differences in how patients respond to these treatments, potentially influencing drug resistance or sensitivity based on the cellâ€™s ability to repair DNA.
