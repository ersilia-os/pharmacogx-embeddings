HLA-DPB1, a gene expressed in antigen-presenting cells, primarily affects drug hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis) through immune modulation, particularly in pharmacodynamic interactions. For example, its specific alleles may increase the risk of agranulocytosis in patients treated with the antipsychotic drug clozapine, while there is no confirmed pharmacogenetic interaction between HLA-DPB1 and aspirin.
