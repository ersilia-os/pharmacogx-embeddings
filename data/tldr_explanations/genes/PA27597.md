ECHS1, involved in the beta-oxidation of fatty acids, could indirectly influence the efficacy or metabolism of drugs like clopidogrel and aspirin. This potential effect stems from impaired fatty acid metabolism possibly affecting cellular energy states, thereby influencing the pharmacodynamics of these drugs that rely on cellular metabolism for their activation or distribution, though this link remains speculative without direct evidence.
