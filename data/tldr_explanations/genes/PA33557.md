Variations in the expression or activity of PPARD, a gene involved in fatty acid metabolism and inflammation, may influence the effectiveness and side effect profiles of drugs like repaglinide, docetaxel, and thalidomide. PPARD modifications could alter repaglinideâ€™s effectiveness in diabetes management by affecting insulin sensitivity, while impacting docetaxel and thalidomide's therapeutic outcomes in cancer treatment through mechanisms related to inflammation and cell differentiation processes.
