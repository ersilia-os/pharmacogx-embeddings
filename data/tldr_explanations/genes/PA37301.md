The Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) gene significantly affects the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of various drugs due to its role in vitamin D metabolism and bone health. On the pharmacokinetic side, drugs like midazolam and rifampin may have altered metabolism or effects based on VDR activity or genotypes, while pharmacodynamically, VDR variants can alter the efficacy of drugs such as calcitriol, raloxifene, alendronate, dexamethasone, and tamoxifen, impacting therapeutic outcomes in conditions like osteoporosis, rickets, and immune or hormone-responsive diseases.
