CMPK1, involved in nucleotide biosynthesis, plays a significant role in metabolizing nucleotide analogs, such as the chemotherapy drug gemcitabine, by phosphorylating them to active forms. Variations in the CMPK1 gene can affect the efficacy and toxicity of gemcitabine, impacting therapeutic outcomes due to altered drug activation and metabolism.
