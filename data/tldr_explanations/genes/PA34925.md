The SACM1L gene, which is involved in phosphoinositide metabolism impacting intracellular signaling and membrane dynamics, may indirectly influence the effectiveness and mechanism of action of bupropion, a drug used for treating depression and aiding in smoking cessation. Although there are no direct pharmacokinetic interactions documented between SACM1L and bupropion, genetic variations in SACM1L could alter cellular signaling pathways, potentially affecting bupropionâ€™s pharmacological efficacy.
