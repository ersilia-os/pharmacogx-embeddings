CD69 does not directly interact with drugs but acts as a biomarker in immune activation, helping clinicians assess the effectiveness of immunomodulatory therapies like TNF inhibitors and interferons in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. By monitoring changes in CD69 expression, it is possible to glean insights into the immune system's response to these treatments and manage disease activity accordingly.
