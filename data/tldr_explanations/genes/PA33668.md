PPP2R2A does not have well-established direct interactions with drugs in clinical use, but it might influence the effects of drugs indirectly through its role in apoptosis, the cell cycle, and neurodegenerative processes. This is particularly relevant for kinase inhibitors used in cancer therapy, where PPP2R2A's function in dephosphorylation could affect drug efficacy and therapeutic outcomes by impacting signal transduction pathways related to cell proliferation and survival.
