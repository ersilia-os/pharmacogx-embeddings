The effectiveness of metformin, a medication used in diabetes management, can be impacted by mutations in the HNF1B gene, which plays a significant role in insulin secretion and glucose metabolism. Although metformin works by enhancing insulin sensitivity and reducing glucose production in the liver, the precise interaction between HNF1B mutations and the drug's pharmacodynamics is not clearly defined, showing that the gene's influence on metabolic pathways may affect how well metformin works in individuals with these mutations.
