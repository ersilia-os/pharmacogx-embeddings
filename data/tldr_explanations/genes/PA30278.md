LAMB3, known for its role in forming structural components of the skin, doesn't typically interact directly with drugs like fentanyl in a pharmacogenetic manner; rather, fentanyl is used to manage pain in conditions such as Junctional Epidermolysis Bullosa (JEB), where LAMB3 mutations cause severe skin lesions. This represents symptomatic treatment rather than a direct influence on the drugâ€™s action or metabolism.
