The interactions between the gene CREB1 and psychotropic drugs such as diazepam and citalopram are significant in understanding their effects on psychological disorders. Diazepam influences CREB1-mediated pathways indirectly by enhancing GABAergic transmission and affecting neuronal excitability, while citalopram impacts CREB1 by altering serotonergic signaling, which is essential for mood regulation, potentially affecting antidepressant efficacy and neuroplastic responses.
