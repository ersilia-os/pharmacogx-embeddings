The MYBPH gene, encoding for a protein involved in muscle contraction and stabilization, may have pharmacodynamic interactions with drugs like caffeine, which affects muscle performance and metabolism. Although the specific interactions between MYBPH and caffeine are not yet well-documented, it is speculated that MYBPH could affect how individual responses to caffeine impact muscle performance and fatigue resistance due to its role in muscle contraction mechanisms.
