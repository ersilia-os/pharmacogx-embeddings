ABCC2 gene variants influence the function of the MRP2 protein, affecting the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic outcomes of various drugs. For example, genetic variations like c.1249G>A and c.3972C>T can alter the excretion and plasma concentrations of drugs such as methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, rosuvastatin, and others including irinotecan and docetaxel, thereby impacting drug effectiveness and toxicity. Non-pharmacokinetic interactions involve drugs like clopidogrel and sorafenib, which may affect therapeutic outcomes through MRP2-related pathways.
