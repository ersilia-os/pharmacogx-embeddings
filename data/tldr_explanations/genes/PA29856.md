ILKAP does not have well-documented direct pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs such as hydrochlorothiazide; its role is more in regulating cellular functions like proliferation and adhesion via modulation of integrin-linked kinase. Although ILKAP indirectly influences disease states like cancer, there are no established direct interactions with pharmacological agents that modify drug responses based on genetic variations.
