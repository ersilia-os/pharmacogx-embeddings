The interaction between the gene KMT2E and the drug duloxetine does not involve direct effects on drug metabolism but is likely through pharmacodynamic pathways, where KMT2E's role in chromatin and histone methylation may affect gene expression changes relevant to duloxetineâ€™s therapeutic action in neural functions. Although duloxetine does not directly interact with the KMT2E pathways, it may still be indirectly influenced by the epigenetic modifications mediated by KMT2E, impacting neural plasticity and response to the drug.
