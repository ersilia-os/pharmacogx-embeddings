CSK's potential pharmacogenetic interactions primarily concern its indirect role in modifying the efficacy or toxicity of kinase inhibitor cancer treatments by regulating Src family kinase activities, affecting therapeutic outcomes in a pharmacodynamic manner. While the drug hydrochlorothiazide is mentioned, its connection to CSK is unusual and likely involves an unconventional pathway related to non-pharmacokinetic effects on fluid balance and cell signaling rather than CSK's typical functions.
