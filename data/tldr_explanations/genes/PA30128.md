The pharmacogenetic interactions of the KIT gene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, particularly affect the pharmacodynamics of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like imatinib and sunitinib used in treating gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Certain mutations in KIT, such as those in exon 11, enhance imatinib's efficacy, while those in exon 9 lead to poorer responses, suggesting the critical role of genotyping for tailored treatment and managing drug resistance with TKIs including next-generation versions like dasatinib or avapritinib.
