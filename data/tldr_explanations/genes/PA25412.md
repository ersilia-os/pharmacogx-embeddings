The pharmacogenetics of BRCA2 plays a critical role in the effectiveness of PARP inhibitors like rucaparib, talazoparib, and niraparib in treating cancers with BRCA mutations, such as ovarian and breast cancers. These drugs exploit the defective DNA repair mechanisms in cells with BRCA2 mutations by inhibiting PARP, an enzyme essential for repairing single-strand DNA breaks, thus promoting the death of cancer cells that cannot use normal BRCA2 pathways for DNA repair.
