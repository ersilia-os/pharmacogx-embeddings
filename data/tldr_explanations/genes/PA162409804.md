The gene ZMIZ1, which plays a role in transcriptional regulation and cancer, particularly in prostate cancer, may also impact the effectiveness and toxicity of the cancer drug capecitabine. This influence is due to ZMIZ1's potential to affect how tumor cells proliferate and respond to apoptosis, processes vital to the metabolism and action mechanism of capecitabine within these cells.
