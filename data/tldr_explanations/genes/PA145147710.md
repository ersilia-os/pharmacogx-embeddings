WBP2NL, which primarily concerns sperm function and fertilization, has no direct impact on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of opioids like oxycodone, codeine, hydrocodone, and tramadol, which are metabolized by liver enzymes such as CYP2D6. Any pharmacogenetic interaction between WBP2NL and these drugs remains unproven, with the gene's role mainly affecting reproductive functions rather than influencing the metabolic pathways involved with these medications.
