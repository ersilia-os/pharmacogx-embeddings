LHX2, a transcription factor critical in neural development and stem cell differentiation, does not yet have direct pharmacogenetic interactions with any clinically used drugs; it neither affects drug metabolism nor response currently documented. Future therapeutics might target LHX2 to treat neurodevelopmental disorders or for use in regenerative medicine, potentially influencing neural repair and development.
