KCNMB2, which enhances the activity of BK channels affecting neuronal and smooth muscle function, may influence the efficacy of drugs like ritodrine, used for managing preterm labor by relaxing smooth muscle in the uterus. Although ritodrine primarily targets beta-adrenergic receptors for muscle relaxation, the interaction with KCNMB2's modulation of BK channels could affect the overall responsiveness of smooth muscle to the drug, despite ritodrine not directly targeting these channels.
