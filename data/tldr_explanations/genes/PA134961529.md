The OR2B11 gene, primarily associated with olfactory functions, does not typically interact with pharmacogenetic pathways involving drug metabolism or efficacy. However, the cancer treatment drug axitinib might influence OR2B11, potentially affecting odor perception as a secondary effect, though this does not impact axitinib's primary mechanism or pharmacokinetics.
