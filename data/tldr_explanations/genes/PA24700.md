The enzyme ALDH3B2, involved in detoxifying aldehydes and metabolizing alcohol, potentially affects the pharmacokinetics of drugs that produce aldehyde intermediates, such as those used in cancer or chronic alcoholism treatments, by altering their breakdown and elimination. While specific drugs interacting with ALDH3B2 has not been conclusively identified, its similarity to other enzymes like ALDH2, which interacts with substances like ethanol and nitroglycerin, suggests it might similarly influence the effectiveness or toxicity of these drugs.
