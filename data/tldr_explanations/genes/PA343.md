The gene SULT1A1, which is important for drug metabolism and detoxification through sulfation, has variations such as SULT1A1*2 that affect how drugs are metabolized. For example, these variations can alter the metabolism of tamoxifen, reducing its effectiveness in treating breast cancer by impacting the formation of active metabolites, and affect the safety profile of acetaminophen by influencing its toxicity levels. Additionally, SULT1A1 interactions with drugs like fulvestrant and apixaban are related to its role in hormone metabolism, impacting pharmacodynamics and drug effectiveness.
