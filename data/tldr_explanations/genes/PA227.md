The LDLR gene is essential in mediating the effects of statins such as atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, lovastatin, and fluvastatin, which enhance the clearance of LDL cholesterol by upregulating LDLR expression. Variations in the LDLR gene affect the efficacy of these drugs, while lomitapide, targeting a different part of the cholesterol regulation pathway, also depends on LDLR for its effectiveness.
