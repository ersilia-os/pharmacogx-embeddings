NIPAL2, which is potentially involved in magnesium ion transport, has not yet demonstrated established pharmacogenetic interactions with specific drugs, but its role in ion homeostasis could significantly impact drug metabolism or efficacy, especially in conditions associated with metal ion dysregulation. Although no studies have directly linked NIPAL2 to pharmacokinetic pathways, its involvement in metabolic balances suggests that future research might reveal interactions with drugs used in magnesium or metal ion-related disorders, potentially affecting drug responses and therapeutic outcomes.
