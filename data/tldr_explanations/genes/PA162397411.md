NECAB1's pharmacogenetic interactions with clopidogrel and aspirin are not well-documented, but a potential influence could be hypothesized due to NECAB1's involvement in calcium signaling pathways, which are important in processes like platelet function and inflammation. Although clopidogrel's activation and aspirin's anti-inflammatory effects might be indirectly influenced by calcium-signaling proteins like NECAB1, these interactions are speculative and not established.
