The IFNL4 gene influences the effectiveness of hepatitis C treatments like pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin through immune system modulation based on genetic variations, such as the rs12979860 polymorphism. Although IFNL4 does not alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs, it affects the pharmacodynamics by modulating how the immune system responds to various antiviral drugs, including atorvastatin, simeprevir, sofosbuvir, and others, which impacts treatment efficacy.
