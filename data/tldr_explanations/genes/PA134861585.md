PARP inhibitors like olaparib and rucaparib, used in cancer treatment, can have their efficacy or toxicity affected by genetic variations in the PARP14 gene, which plays a role in DNA repair and immune system modulation. Differences in PARP14 gene expression or function might alter the therapeutic outcomes of these inhibitors by affecting tumor suppression and inflammation modulation.
