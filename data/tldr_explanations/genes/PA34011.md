The PTPRC gene, which plays a critical role in immune regulation, is significant in pharmacogenetics, particularly regarding its interaction with immune checkpoint inhibitors used in cancer treatment. Variations in the PTPRC gene can affect the efficacy and safety of these drugs by altering T cell and B cell signaling, which impacts immune activation and autoimmunity risks.
