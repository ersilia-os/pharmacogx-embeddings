In individuals with primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1), the effectiveness of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) treatment is influenced by specific mutations in the AGXT gene, which affect the enzyme's ability to metabolize glyoxylate. Such pharmacodynamic interaction means that pyridoxineâ€™s ability to reduce oxalate production and prevent renal complications varies depending on the AGXT genetic mutation.
