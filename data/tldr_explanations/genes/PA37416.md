Variants in the XPNPEP2 gene, which is responsible for coding an enzyme that breaks down proline-rich peptides, can impact the efficacy of ACE inhibitors used to treat hypertension and heart failure by altering enzyme activity. This can lead to an accumulation of peptides, increasing the risk of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema due to insufficient enzymatic activity, thus affecting the pharmacodynamics of these drugs.
