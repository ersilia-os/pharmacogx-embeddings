Variants in the gene ZDHHC7, which is involved in protein palmitoylation, could alter the function and localization of proteins in neurotransmitter systems that are affected by methylphenidate, a drug used for ADHD. This change in protein palmitoylation can potentially influence the pharmacodynamics of methylphenidate, thereby affecting its efficacy and side effect profiles.
