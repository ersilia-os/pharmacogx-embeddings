The gene TUBB3 impacts the effectiveness of microtubule-targeting chemotherapy drugs such as taxanes and vinca alkaloids, used in treating cancers like ovarian and non-small cell lung cancer, by influencing the drugs' ability to stabilize or destabilize microtubules due to variations in microtubule dynamics caused by TUBB3 protein variants. Additionally, TUBB3 is implicated in potential pharmacogenetic interactions with the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine, although the specific mechanism may involve microtubule dynamics in neural processes rather than direct pharmacokinetic interactions.
