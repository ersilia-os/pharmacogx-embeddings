EIF4E2, involved in mRNA translation and expressed in certain tissues, may impact the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy drugs such as carboplatin and paclitaxel. This interaction occurs potentially through pharmacodynamic mechanisms where EIF4E2 modulates the translation of proteins that are crucial for the cellular response to these drugs, thereby influencing drug sensitivity and resistance, particularly under stress conditions like hypoxia.
