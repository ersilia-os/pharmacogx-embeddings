RFPL4B, part of the Ret finger protein family, may interact with tramadol and its more potent metabolite, o-desmethyltramadol, potentially influencing their metabolism or transport processes. This interaction is hypothesized to involve modifications in RFPL4B that could alter the enzyme activity responsible for converting tramadol into its active metabolite, thereby possibly changing the drug's efficacy or toxicity.
