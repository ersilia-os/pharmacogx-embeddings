The gene ABCB11, which codes for the bile salt export pump (BSEP), significantly influences the pharmacokinetics of several drugs, including rosuvastatin, ribavirin, odevixibat, and glyburide, by affecting their hepatic uptake, biliary excretion, or both. Variants in ABCB11 may alter the efficacy and toxicity of these medications, highlighting its importance in personalized drug therapy.
