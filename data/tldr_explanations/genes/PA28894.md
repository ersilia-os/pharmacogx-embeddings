Fluorouracil, a chemotherapy agent, interacts with the gene LGR5, which is involved in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation through the Wnt signaling pathway, particularly in cancerous tissues such as colorectal cancer. This interaction, affecting the efficacy of fluorouracil, operates mainly through pharmacodynamic pathways by potentially influencing the Wnt pathway and modulating cancer stem cell behaviors, which could lead to variations in treatment response based on individual genetic differences in LGR5.
