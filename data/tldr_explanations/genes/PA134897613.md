ENOSF1, involved in thiamine metabolism, impacts the metabolism and efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and capecitabine, with variations in the gene affecting drug efficacy and toxicity, particularly in colorectal cancer treatments. The interaction with methotrexate is speculated to be indirect, related to ENOSF1â€™s role in nucleotide metabolism, which might influence methotrexate's pharmacodynamics, though this link still requires further substantiation.
