Tumors with MSH6 mutations typically exhibit resistance to chemotherapeutic agents like temozolomide and platinum-based drugs (cisplatin and carboplatin) due to impaired DNA mismatch repair processes that these drugs target. While the impact of MSH6 mutations on oxaliplatin, another platinum-based drug, remains less clear, drugs such as fluorouracil and leucovorin may not rely solely on the mismatch repair mechanism, indicating a different type of interaction with the MSH6 gene.
