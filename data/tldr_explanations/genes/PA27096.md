The pharmacogenetic interactions of CYP21A2 focus on its role in managing congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), where mutations in this gene affect enzyme activity crucial for steroid biosynthesis. This dictates the use of tailored glucocorticoid therapy, using drugs like hydrocortisone in children and prednisone or dexamethasone in adults, and fludrocortisone for aldosterone deficiency. Treatment adjustments—including the choice and dosage of medication—are essential based on specific CYP21A2 mutations to avoid negative effects such as growth suppression or insufficient control of androgen excess.
