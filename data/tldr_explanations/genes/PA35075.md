HLA-DRB4 gene primarily affects the immune system and influences the treatment response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis by affecting how specific alleles impact disease progression and drug responsiveness. While HLA-DRB4 does not directly interact with drugs, its role may affect the efficacy and adverse effects of treatments such as DMARDs and indirectly influence immune responses related to drugs like clozapine, though robust data on direct interactions is lacking.
