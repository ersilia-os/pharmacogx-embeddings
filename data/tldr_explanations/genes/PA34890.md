The drug interactions with the RXRA gene significantly influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of various medications. Docetaxel and rosuvastatin interact with RXRA, affecting drug metabolism and transport through altered gene expression, particularly in pathways related to cancer cell metabolism and liver enzymes. Bexarotene, a direct RXRA agonist, depends on RXRA's functional status and expression for its therapeutic effects, highlighting RXRA's crucial role in modulating drug efficacy and safety in cancer and lipid metabolism treatments.
