Variations in the AKR1D1 gene critically affect the metabolism of glucocorticoids and drugs like cholic acid, influencing their efficacy and side effect profiles due to AKR1D1's significant role in steroid metabolism and bile acid synthesis. Although there is no direct link between AKR1D1 and the metabolism of clopidogrel and ibuprofen, changes in steroid hormone levels facilitated by AKR1D1 activity might indirectly affect the efficacy of these drugs.
