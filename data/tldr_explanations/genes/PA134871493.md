ADHFE1 is involved in metabolic pathways for alcohol and retinol, and may indirectly affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs mimicking alcohol structure or generating alcohol-like intermediates, although no specific drugs have been identified for such interactions. Genetic variation in ADHFE1 could influence an individual's metabolism of these substances, potentially altering the metabolism and clearance of related drugs.
