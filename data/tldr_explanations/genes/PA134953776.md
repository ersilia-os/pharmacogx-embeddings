MAML3, which plays a significant role in the Notch signaling pathway and transcriptional regulation related to cell proliferation and cancer, does not have a well-established direct pharmacogenetic relationship with perphenazine, a drug primarily active as a dopamine receptor antagonist. Although perphenazine's potential impact on signaling pathways involving MAML3 is speculative, its influence through the Notch pathway, linked to psychological disorders, suggests a possible but undocumented interaction.
