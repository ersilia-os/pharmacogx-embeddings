The CNR1 gene, encoding the cannabinoid receptor 1, influences the effectiveness and tolerability of cannabinoid-based drugs like Dronabinol and affects the pharmacodynamics of other drugs including nicotine, cocaine, antipsychotics (like quetiapine, haloperidol, and risperidone), antidepressants (such as citalopram), and substances linked to addiction such as heroin and methadone. Variants in CNR1, like rs1049353, may modify drug responses by altering neurotransmitter release upon receptor activation, thus impacting drug efficacy and side effects, particularly in psychiatric conditions and substance abuse disorders.
