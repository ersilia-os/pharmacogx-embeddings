Methadone, disulfiram, buprenorphine, heroin, oxycodone, tramadol, morphine, fentanyl, naltrexone, and cocaine interact with the OPRD1 gene, affecting their pharmacological outcomes such as efficacy, addiction potential, and neurological effects. OPRD1 plays a central role in mediating these effects through its function as the delta opioid receptor, which opioids directly target, while other substances like disulfiram and cocaine influence it indirectly, impacting therapeutic and addiction-related pathways.
