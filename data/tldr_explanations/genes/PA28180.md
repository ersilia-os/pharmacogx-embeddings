Sorafenib and Sunitinib, multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors used to treat cancers like renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, interact pharmacodynamically with the FLT1 gene by inhibiting its activity, thereby reducing tumor-promoting angiogenesis. Polymorphisms in FLT1 can alter the efficacy and toxicity of these drugs, as changes in the gene could affect receptor expression or activity, influencing how cancer cells respond to anti-angiogenic treatments.
