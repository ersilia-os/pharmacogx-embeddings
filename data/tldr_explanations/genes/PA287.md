PTGER2, which encodes the Prostaglandin E Receptor 2, plays a significant role in the interaction with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin, affecting pharmacodynamic responses due to its mediation of prostaglandin E2 effects. Genetic variations in PTGER2 can influence how individuals respond to aspirin, affecting its effectiveness in pain relief and inflammation reduction, as well as the likelihood of experiencing adverse effects.
