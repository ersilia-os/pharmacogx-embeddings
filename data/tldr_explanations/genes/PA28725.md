GLP-1 receptor agonists such as exenatide, liraglutide, and semaglutide target the GLP1R gene to enhance insulin release, which is crucial for managing type 2 diabetes and obesity. Variability in GLP1R gene can influence the effectiveness of these drugs and DPP-4 inhibitors like vildagliptin and sitagliptin, which indirectly boost GLP-1 receptor signaling by preventing GLP-1 breakdown, affecting glycemic control and weight management. Drugs like perphenazine, olanzapine, and clozapine, primarily used in psychiatric settings, do not directly interact with GLP1R but may have indirect effects on appetite and weight through GLP-1 pathway mechanics.
