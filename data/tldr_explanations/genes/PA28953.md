GPX5, mainly involved in reducing oxidative stress in male reproductive tissues, does not directly interact with drugs pharmacokinetically or pharmacodynamically. However, it may indirectly affect the impact of chemotherapeutic agents like carboplatin and gemcitabine, which generate oxidative stress, by potentially mitigating the side effects on non-target tissues, particularly reproductive tissues. This interaction is speculative and based solely on the enzyme's role in protecting against oxidative damage.
