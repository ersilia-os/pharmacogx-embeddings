TMEM196, a gene implicated in general cellular processes across various tissues, has no confirmed pharmacogenetic interactions with specific drugs, such as aspirin; any suggested associations are speculative and lack direct scientific support. The gene's potential effect on drug interactions is theoretical and would require further research to determine any substantial pharmacogenetic impact.
