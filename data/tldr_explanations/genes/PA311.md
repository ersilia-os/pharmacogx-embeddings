Drugs such as methylphenidate, amphetamines, bupropion, antipsychotics (like haloperidol, risperidone, and clozapine), as well as substances like cocaine, disulfiram, and nicotine interact with the SLC6A3 gene, which encodes the dopamine transporter involved in dopamine reuptake in the brain. These interactions affect the pharmacodynamics of the drugs, influencing their effectiveness and impact based on variations in the SLC6A3 gene.
