TTC37 exhibits nominal pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs, with a speculative interaction noted between TTC37 and duloxetine, used for depression and anxiety. Although it is suggested that duloxetine might influence protein complexes related to TTC37, this interaction is not based on standard pharmacokinetic processes such as metabolism or transport, and is not well-supported by current scientific evidence.
