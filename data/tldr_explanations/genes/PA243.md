Genetic variations in the MPO (Myeloperoxidase) gene can influence the effectiveness of antihypertensive drugs by affecting oxidative mechanisms that impact vascular tone and integrity, demonstrating a pharmacodynamic relationship. Similarly, the efficiency of MPO inhibitors, used for conditions like atherosclerosis and autoimmune disorders, can also be affected by individual genetic differences in the MPO gene, highlighting both pharmacodynamic and potential pharmacokinetic interactions.
