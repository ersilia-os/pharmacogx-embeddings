LIG3, which facilitates DNA repair, plays a significant role in the pharmacodynamics of DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic drugs like cyclophosphamide. Variations in LIG3 activity can alter the drug's efficacy because it repairs the DNA damage that cyclophosphamide is intended to inflict, thereby impacting therapeutic outcomes.
