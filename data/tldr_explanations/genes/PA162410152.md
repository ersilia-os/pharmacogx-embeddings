The gene ZNF385D, involved in transcriptional regulation, might interact with the antidepressant duloxetine by potentially influencing its pharmacodynamics through the alteration of gene expression that impacts neural pathways affected by duloxetine. However, this interaction remains speculative as there is insufficient evidence of a direct pharmacogenomic link between ZNF385D and duloxetine.
