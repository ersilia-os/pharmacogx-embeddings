CYB5R4, or Cytochrome b5 Reductase 4, impacts the pharmacokinetics of drugs like primaquine, isosorbide dinitrate, and isosorbide mononitrate by influencing their redox reactions through electron transfers needed for drug activation or detoxification, potentially affecting their efficacy or toxicity. In the case of metoclopramide, CYB5R4 may indirectly alter drug metabolism pathways, thus affecting drug clearance and therapeutic effectiveness. Individuals with variant forms of CYB5R4 could see differences in the clinical effects of these drugs due to changes in these metabolic processes.
