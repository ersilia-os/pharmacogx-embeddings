While there are no well-documented direct pharmacogenetic interactions between CHST4 and specific drugs, its role in the biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate suggests potential indirect implications for drugs that affect connective tissue integrity or target extracellular components, such as antifibrotic agents and drugs influencing cellular adhesion or migration. These implications stem from CHST4's involvement in extracellular matrix remodeling, although specific drug interactions remain to be established through further research.
