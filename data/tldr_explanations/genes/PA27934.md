EYA4 does not have documented direct interactions influencing the pharmacokinetics or metabolism of drugs, but its role in conditions like sensorineural hearing loss and dilated cardiomyopathy could indirectly affect the use and efficacy of certain drugs managing these conditions, such as beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and therapies aimed at hearing loss. This indirect potential influence arises from its biological functions rather than established pharmacogenetic evidence.
