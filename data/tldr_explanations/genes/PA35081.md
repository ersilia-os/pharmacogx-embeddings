The gene HLA-E, which plays a significant role in immune system regulation, may interact pharmacodynamically with methotrexate, a drug used for autoimmune diseases and cancer. This interaction likely occurs as methotrexate modulates immune responses that are under the control of HLA-E, affecting drug efficacy and potential adverse effects rather than affecting the drug's absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion.
