The drugs metformin, trandolapril, verapamil, and pioglitazone have been mentioned in relation to the gene PTPRD; however, these drugs do not show a direct pharmacogenetic interaction with PTPRD. Metformin and pioglitazone might have indirect interactions through their roles in pathways possibly connected to those regulated by PTPRD, which is a tumor suppressor. Trandolapril and verapamil, meanwhile, do not have clear pharmacogenetic links with PTPRD, suggesting their effects might be more related to broader systemic or cellular impacts rather than specific interactions with this gene.
