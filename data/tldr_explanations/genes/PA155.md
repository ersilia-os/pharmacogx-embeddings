ERCC1 plays a crucial role in cancer chemotherapy through its involvement in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, particularly affecting the effectiveness of platinum-based therapies like carboplatin and cisplatin. The geneâ€™s expression level impacts drug resistance; higher ERCC1 expression is linked to resistance, while lower expression increases sensitivity due to compromised DNA repair in cancer cells. Additionally, drugs such as docetaxel, doxorubicin, and others may show variations in efficacy influenced by ERCC1-mediated DNA repair processes.
