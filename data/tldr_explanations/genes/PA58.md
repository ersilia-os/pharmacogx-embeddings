The gene ABCC6 may impact the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and thalidomide by altering their absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion due to its role in detoxification pathways and its presence in the liver and kidneys. This interaction might affect the drugsâ€™ bioavailability or toxicity, potentially leading to different therapeutic outcomes or adverse effects, especially considering ABCC6's potential to handle lipophilic drugs and chemotherapeutic agents through cellular transport or efflux mechanisms.
