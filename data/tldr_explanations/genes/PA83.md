Variations in the CACNA1C gene, which encodes the alpha-1C subunit of L-type calcium channels, significantly affect the pharmacodynamics of several cardiovascular drugs such as verapamil, nifedipine, amlodipine, felodipine, nimodipine, and nitrendipine by altering their efficacy in modulating calcium influx, which is crucial for treating hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias. Additionally, lacidipine and ritodrine interact with these channels, influencing cardiac and smooth muscle function, while drugs like valproic acid, warfarin, citalopram, and atenolol may have indirect interactions through shared signaling pathways or cardiovascular impacts, with gene polymorphisms potentially affecting therapeutic outcomes.
