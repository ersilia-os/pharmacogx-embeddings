Variability in the ACE gene, such as the insertion (I) or deletion (D) polymorphism, impacts the effectiveness and side effects of ACE inhibitors including lisinopril, enalapril, and others by altering the enzyme that regulates blood pressure and vasoconstriction. Although not directly interacting with the ACE enzyme, drugs like hydrochlorothiazide, losartan, and amlodipine, along with others such as spironolactone and atenolol, might still exhibit variable responses due to changes in the renin-angiotensin system mediated by the ACE gene, highlighting its central role in cardiovascular pharmacotherapy.
