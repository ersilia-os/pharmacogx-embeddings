Variations in the SLC6A9 gene, which encodes the GlyT1 transporter involved in regulating synaptic glycine levels, can influence the pharmacological effects of drugs that modulate NMDA receptors or utilize neurotransmitters in treating neuropsychiatric conditions like schizophrenia. Though not directly affecting SLC6A9, methamphetamine may indirectly impact glycine levels and functions due to its effects on broader neurotransmitter systems such as dopamine and serotonin, potentially altering the effectiveness of antipsychotics and NMDA receptor modulators through modified neurotransmitter balance.
