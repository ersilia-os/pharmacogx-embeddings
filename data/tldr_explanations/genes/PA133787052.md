The VKORC1 gene plays a critical role in the pharmacogenetics of warfarin and other coumarin-type anticoagulants such as phenprocoumon and acenocoumarol, affecting their dosing through its allelic variation, particularly the -1639 G>A polymorphism. Warfarin requires variable dosing depending on an individual's VKORC1 genotype, with the AA genotype necessitating lower doses, highlighting a pharmacodynamic interaction that influences drug effectiveness without affecting its pharmacokinetics.
