Although TTC6, involved in protein-protein interactions, has not been directly linked to specific pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs, its function in cellular DNA damage response might impact the effectiveness and toxicity of chemotherapy drugs like alkylating agents and topoisomerase inhibitors. Surprisingly, hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic not associated with DNA damage, is also implicated, suggesting a potential unidentified interaction with TTC6 that may influence its pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetics.
