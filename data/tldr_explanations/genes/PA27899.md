The ETFDH gene, involved in mitochondrial energy production, does not directly interact with most pharmaceutical drugs but influences the management of multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) through the use of supplements like riboflavin, L-carnitine, and coenzyme Q10, which improve mitochondrial function. The potential indirect effects of methylphenidate on energy balance or metabolic processes in patients with specific ETFDH gene mutations suggest possible interactions, though these are currently speculative and require further study.
