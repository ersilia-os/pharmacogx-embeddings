The gene DKK1, integral to the Wnt signaling pathway and impacting bone metabolism, does not directly alter drug metabolism but significantly influences pharmacodynamics. This influence is particularly relevant in diseases like osteoporosis and cancer, where the potential interaction between DKK1 and the osteoporosis drug alendronate might affect the drugâ€™s efficacy and safety by modulating bone resorption and formation dynamics, although explicit clinical documentation of this interaction is lacking.
