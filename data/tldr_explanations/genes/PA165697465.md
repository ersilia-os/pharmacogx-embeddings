The SPATS2L gene, which is involved in RNA processing and immune system regulation, has not exhibited significant direct interactions with specific drugs, except for a potential indirect interaction with salbutamol, used for treating asthma. This interaction is hypothesized to influence immune responses in airway tissues through pharmacodynamic pathways by affecting the immune or inflammatory responses, rather than affecting how salbutamol is metabolized or transported in the body.
