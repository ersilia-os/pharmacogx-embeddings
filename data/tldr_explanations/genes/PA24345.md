Montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist used for asthma and allergic rhinitis, indirectly impacts the leukotriene pathway influenced by the LTA4H gene, which is crucial for synthesizing leukotriene B4 involved in inflammation. Despite not directly inhibiting LTA4H, Montelukast's effectiveness can be affected by genetic variations in LTA4H, particularly in conditions exacerbated by leukotriene-mediated inflammation.
