UCP2, involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism and oxidative stress responses, may influence the metabolism and efficacy of the antidiabetic drug repaglinide through its impact on mitochondrial function and energy expenditure. Variations in the UCP2 gene could alter how repaglinide is metabolized, potentially affecting insulin secretion dynamics or cellular responses to insulin, thereby modifying the drug's effectiveness or required dosage.
