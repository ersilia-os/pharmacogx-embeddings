CYP2C9 gene polymorphisms influence the metabolism of various drugs, affecting their therapeutic effectiveness and risk of side effects. Drugs such as warfarin, phenytoin, celecoxib, losartan, and tolbutamide require dose customization based on CYP2C9 genetic variants to optimize treatment outcomes and minimize complications like bleeding, drug toxicity, and gastrointestinal issues.
