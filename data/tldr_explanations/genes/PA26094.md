The CASP9 gene, primarily involved in apoptosis, is speculated to influence the response to certain drugs, especially in cancer therapy, where its role could affect the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents that induce cell death by modulating the degree of apoptosis. Although not well-documented, such interactions predominantly concern pharmacodynamics, and drugs used in targeted cancer therapies to enhance apoptotic responses may show different effects based on variations in the CASP9 gene.
