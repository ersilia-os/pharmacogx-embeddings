The STRBP gene, involved in the regulation of mRNA processing during spermatogenesis, has limited direct pharmacogenetic interactions with common drugs due to its specific expression in the testis. Methylphenidate, used for ADHD, has no direct pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with STRBP, but there may be an indirect connection through the broader impacts of neurobehavioral disorders on reproductive health.
