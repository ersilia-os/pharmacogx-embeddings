Variations in the GAD2 gene, which is essential in converting L-glutamate to GABA, may impact the effectiveness of benzodiazepines in treating disorders like epilepsy by influencing GABAergic transmission. Additionally, methamphetamineâ€™s broader effects on neurotransmitter systems might also interact with GAD2, affecting neuronal excitability or neurotransmitter balance, suggesting potential non-pharmacokinetic interactions. These interactions are primarily pharmacodynamic, concerning how changes in GAD2 influence drug efficacy via alterations in neurotransmitter levels and brain receptor interactions.
