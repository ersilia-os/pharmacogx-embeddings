Methylphenidate, used to treat ADHD, might interact with the ESYT2 gene, which is involved in cellular signaling and lipid metabolism; this interaction could potentially influence the drug's efficacy or stability, categorizing it as more of a pharmacodynamic interaction. Other drugs affecting cellular membranes or lipid metabolism could also be influenced by ESYT2's function, although specific examples have not been extensively documented.
