TDP1, a gene crucial in DNA repair, when inhibited, may enhance the effectiveness of topoisomerase I inhibitors like irinotecan by reducing cancer cells' ability to repair induced DNA damage, thereby potentially increasing the cytotoxic effects of these drugs. This interaction highlights the significance of considering genetic variations and activity of TDP1 in the pharmacodynamics of cancer treatments involving topoisomerase inhibitors.
