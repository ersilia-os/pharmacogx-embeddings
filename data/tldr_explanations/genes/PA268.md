ABCB4 mutations, which alter the function of the MDR3 protein, can impact the pharmacokinetics of the drug imatinib, used for treating chronic myeloid leukemia, by affecting the drug's transport and disposition in hepatocytes. This interaction may change the drugâ€™s effectiveness and increase the risk of drug-induced liver injury (DILI), highlighting the potential importance of considering ABCB4 gene variations in personalized dosing or therapy for optimal treatment outcomes and reduced liver complication risks.
