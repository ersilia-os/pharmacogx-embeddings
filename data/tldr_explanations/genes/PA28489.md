Drugs such as benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam and lorazepam) and other medications including propofol, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and valproic acid interact with the GABRA1 gene, impacting their efficacy and safety. These interactions influence GABAergic neurotransmission, wherein benzodiazepines increase chloride channel opening frequency, and the other mentioned drugs enhance GABA(A) receptor activity or mimic GABA effects, with potential variations in drug responsiveness or adverse effects due to individual GABRA1 gene variants.
