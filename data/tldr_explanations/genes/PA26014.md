Variations in the CACNB4 gene, which affects the function of L-type calcium channels, can influence the efficacy and safety of calcium channel blockers such as verapamil and diltiazem, commonly used for treating hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias. These genetic differences may impact drug response and optimal dosing, explaining the variability in treatment outcomes among individuals with cardiovascular and neurological disorders.
