Variations in the IL1A gene, which codes for Interleukin 1 Alpha, affect the pharmacodynamics of drugs like anakinra, an anti-inflammatory medication, by influencing its effectiveness and variability in therapeutic outcomes due to its role in modulating immune responses. Although IL1A does not have a direct pharmacogenetic interaction with olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, its impact on cytokine levels could indirectly influence inflammation-related side effects or the drug's efficacy.
