The gene SPINK5, which mainly affects skin integrity and immune response, has minimal impact on the pharmacokinetics of drugs like glyburide, a diabetes medication, because it does not interact with the drug's metabolism pathways. However, SPINK5 may influence the pharmacodynamics of dermatological and immunological drugs, possibly affecting the efficacy and safety of treatments that alter skin turnover and immune function, due to its role in controlling skin and mucosal barriers.
