ARMS2 gene variations, involved in retinal maintenance and angiogenic pathways, may influence the effectiveness of verteporfin, a drug used for photodynamic therapy in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Given its role in targeting abnormal retinal blood vessels, ARMS2 genetic background could modulate therapeutic outcomes of verteporfin treatment, highlighting the need to consider these genetic factors when using this medication.
