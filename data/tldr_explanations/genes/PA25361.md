Drugs functioning as Smac mimetics target XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein) in cancer treatment, aiming to antagonize its apoptosis-inhibiting function and promote cell death in tumor cells, especially in cancers where XIAP is overexpressed. This interaction is a part of a pharmacodynamic approach to enhance the efficacy of cancer therapies by reversing resistance mechanisms related to XIAPâ€™s inhibition of the apoptotic process.
