Drugs like risperidone and carboplatin may interact pharmacodynamically with the AKT1 gene, which plays a critical role in cell proliferation and survival, particularly in cancer pathways. Risperidone might indirectly influence AKT1-related pathways, while carboplatin's interaction could affect its efficacy through AKT1's role in apoptosis regulation, thereby impacting drug responses and underscoring the importance of considering AKT1 in personalized medicine.
