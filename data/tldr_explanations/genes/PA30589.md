Although no drugs are specifically known to interact pharmacogenetically with MAP2K4, its role in activating JNK and p38 MAP kinases suggests it could influence the efficacy and safety of MAPK inhibitors used in cancer therapy. Genetic variations in MAP2K4 might affect how these drugs modulate immune responses or apoptosis, impacting therapeutic outcomes based on individual genotypes.
