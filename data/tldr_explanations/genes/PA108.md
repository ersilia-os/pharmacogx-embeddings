CETP inhibitors such as torcetrapib, dalcetrapib, anacetrapib, and evacetrapib directly target CETP to modulate lipid metabolism by increasing HDL cholesterol and potentially decreasing LDL cholesterol, with their effectiveness varying due to genetic variations in the CETP gene. While CETP does not directly interact with the pharmacokinetics of statins like rosuvastatin and atorvastatin, it may influence the overall lipid profile outcomes and cardiovascular risk management associated with these drugs, suggesting an indirect pharmacodynamic interaction linked to genetic variations in CETP.
