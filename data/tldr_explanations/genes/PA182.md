GSTM1 plays a crucial role in the metabolism of several drugs, such as rifampin, busulfan, azathioprine, and isoniazid, with the GSTM1 null genotype leading to reduced enzyme activity that can increase plasma levels, slow elimination rates, and potentially result in higher drug exposure and toxicity. This impaired detoxification can influence both the efficacy and adverse effects of these drugs, underscoring the importance of considering GSTM1 status when managing medications to tailor drug dosages and minimize side effects.
