Variations in the VEGFA gene impact the effectiveness and safety of drugs like bevacizumab, axitinib, pazopanib, pegaptanib, sunitinib, and regorafenib, which target VEGF pathways involved in cancer treatment and ophthalmic conditions. These genetic differences can affect patient responses and the occurrence of side effects, thus influencing the overall therapeutic outcomes for these medications.
