The gene PDLIM5 influences the pharmacodynamics of drugs, notably fluoxetine, a commonly used antidepressant, by affecting neuronal signaling pathways, which play a crucial role in neuronal survival and function. This gene's interactions are mainly due to its influence on signaling pathways such as protein kinase C and ERK, thereby making PDLIM5 pivotal in determining the efficacy and side effect profile of psychiatric medications based on individual genetic differences.
