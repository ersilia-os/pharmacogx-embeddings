The gene RGL4 may affect the pharmacokinetics of tramadol and its more potent metabolite, o-desmethyltramadol, potentially by modulating the activity or expression of the liver enzyme CYP2D6 involved in tramadol metabolism. This interaction likely occurs through indirect signaling pathways that influence the expression or activity of metabolic enzymes, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully defined.
