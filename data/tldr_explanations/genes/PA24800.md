The gene ANK3 significantly affects how patients with bipolar disorder respond to lithium treatment, with specific ANK3 polymorphisms associated with variations in the drug's efficacy, suggesting a role in personalized therapy approaches. On the other hand, capecitabine, a chemotherapeutic drug, does not show a direct pharmacogenetic interaction with ANK3, as its metabolism is primarily influenced by other enzymes without a clear link to the neurological functions of ANK3.
