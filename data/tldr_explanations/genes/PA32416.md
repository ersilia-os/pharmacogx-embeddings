The gene OR52J3, involved in olfactory sensory pathways, has not been linked to specific drugs or known to alter pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic processes affecting drug metabolism, efficacy, or safety. Currently, there are no identified pharmacogenetic interactions with OR52J3, thus its impact on drug therapy is considered non-significant.
