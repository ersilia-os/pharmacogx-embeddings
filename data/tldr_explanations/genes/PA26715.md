The COL2A1 gene, mainly involved in skeletal diseases, does not have direct pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs like salbutamol through pathways such as pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. Instead, any interaction between salbutamol and COL2A1 is likely incidental, focusing on symptom management for respiratory difficulties possibly worsened by skeletal deformities linked to mutations in COL2A1.
