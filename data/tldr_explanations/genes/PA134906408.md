The OTOS gene, which is crucial for maintaining ear structure and is associated with hearing impairment, does not exhibit significant pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs, as it is not involved in drug metabolism or response pathways, nor does it influence the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of medications. There is also no evidence that links the OTOS gene to drug-induced ototoxicity.
