The selective ADORA3 agonists, IB-MECA and Cl-IB-MECA, are tailored to target the A3 receptor, exploiting its anti-inflammatory properties to potentially treat conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and ischemic injuries by influencing signaling pathways such as cyclic AMP, Akt, and MAPK. The interaction between these agonists and methotrexate may enhance methotrexate's efficacy or reduce its toxicity in rheumatoid arthritis and certain cancers, likely through a synergistic effect on shared inflammatory pathways.
