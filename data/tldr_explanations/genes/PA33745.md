PRKAA2, integral to the AMPK pathway, indirectly interacts with metformin—a drug used for type 2 diabetes—by influencing its AMPK-mediated mechanisms which improve insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake. Additionally, though not well-defined, PRKAA2 may affect the metabolic side effects such as weight gain and diabetes associated with psychiatric medications olanzapine and clozapine, due to its role in maintaining energy balance and metabolism.
