The CHD1L gene, linked to DNA repair and involved in cancer, especially hepatocellular carcinoma, may interact with oncologic therapies like metformin. Metformin, commonly used for diabetes and known for its anti-cancer effects, might be less effective in cancers with abnormal CHD1L activity due to its role in genomic stability and cell proliferation.
