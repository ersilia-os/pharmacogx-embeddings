The TANK gene, which regulates immune and inflammatory responses, may interact pharmacogenetically with drugs that impact TNF signaling or inhibit NF-ÎºB, such as thalidomide or lenalidomide. Variations in TANK function or expression could lead to differences in the efficacy or safety of these drugs, although direct clinical evidence for such interactions is currently lacking.
