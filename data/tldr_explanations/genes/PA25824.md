TSPEAR, involved in cellular adhesion and cardiovascular signaling, may indirectly influence the pharmacodynamics of antiplatelet drugs like clopidogrel and aspirin, which affect platelet aggregation and cardiovascular health. Despite no direct evidence linking TSPEAR to drug pharmacokinetics, its role in cardiovascular processes and signal transmission could alter the effectiveness or side effects of these cardiovascular-related drugs through mechanisms related to signal transduction and cellular adhesion.
