HDAC inhibitors like Vorinostat, Romidepsin, and Panobinostat target HDAC1 to inhibit its enzymatic activity, leading to increased histone acetylation that promotes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis while inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, effective particularly in hematologic cancers. Variations in the HDAC1 gene may affect how patients respond to these treatments, influencing both the efficacy and safety of the drugs.
