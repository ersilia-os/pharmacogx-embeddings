ZSCAN25 is hypothesized to interact with a diverse range of drugs including apixaban, finasteride, and simvastatin, among others, due to its role in transcriptional regulation which could impact pharmacodynamic processes. However, there is currently no direct evidence or mechanistic insights linking ZSCAN25 to specific pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic changes with these medications, making any such interactions speculative at this point.
