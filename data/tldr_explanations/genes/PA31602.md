Variations in the gene NFKBIB, which plays a crucial role in inhibiting the NF-kB complex, can affect the efficacy and safety of drugs like glucocorticoids and proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, which influence NF-kB pathway activity. Drugs such as gefitinib, an EGFR inhibitor, may also interact with the NF-kB pathway indirectly through downstream effects, suggesting a potential pharmacogenetic interaction.
