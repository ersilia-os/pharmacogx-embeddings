TUBB2A, crucial in microtubule formation, does not have confirmed pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs, but its role suggests potential interactions with microtubule-targeting drugs like paclitaxel, which stabilizes microtubules, and might be influenced by variations in TUBB2A affecting drug efficacy and side effects. Likewise, drugs like epirubicin and cyclophosphamide, while not directly targeting microtubules, could have their effectiveness influenced indirectly by microtubule structure and variations in TUBB2A due to pharmacodynamic principles.
