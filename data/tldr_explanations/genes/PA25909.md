SLC30A9, a gene involved in zinc transport, could potentially affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs linked with zinc-dependent processes such as those for diabetes or neurological disorders. There is also a speculative interaction with aspirin, potentially through indirect connections with zinc pathways in inflammation modulation or cellular signaling, but this requires further validation.
