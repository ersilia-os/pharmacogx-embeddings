PICK1 (Protein Interacting with C Kinase 1) significantly impacts the action of neuropsychiatric drugs by affecting synaptic trafficking and modulation of ionotropic glutamate receptors such as AMPA and NMDA, which are crucial in neurotransmitter systems like glutamate and dopamine. This interaction may alter the effectiveness of psychiatric medications, notably antipsychotics, and could specifically affect drugs like methamphetamine by changing the dynamics of neurotransmitter receptors, impacting the drug's efficacy or adverse profile primarily through pharmacodynamic rather than pharmacokinetic mechanisms.
