Lomitapide, an MTTP inhibitor, directly targets the MTTP gene to reduce LDL cholesterol by impeding the secretion of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, with its efficacy influenced by genetic variations in MTTP. While statins like atorvastatin and pravastatin interact pharmacologically with lipid metabolism processes potentially linked to MTTP, their effectiveness may also be affected, and clozapine, though primarily an antipsychotic, might have a pharmacogenetic interaction with MTTP affecting its lipid-related metabolic pathways and side effects.
