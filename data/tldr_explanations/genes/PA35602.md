CXCL12 interacts pharmacogenetically with drugs like fludarabine, vincristine, chlorambucil, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide in cancer therapy, influencing their efficacy or toxicity by potentially affecting tumor behavior or immune response through the CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling pathway. Additionally, genetic variations in CXCL12 may impact the effectiveness of CXCR4 antagonists like plerixafor, which are used in mobilizing hematopoietic stem cells, highlighting the significance of CXCL12 genotyping in treatment outcomes, particularly in oncology and immunotherapy.
