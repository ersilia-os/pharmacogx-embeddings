Genetic variations in KCNMB1 can alter the functionality of BK channels, affecting the pharmacodynamics of cardiovascular drugs like isradipine and verapamil, which are calcium channel blockers. This modification potentially influences the efficacy and side effects of these antihypertensive medications due to KCNMB1's role in regulating blood pressure through BK channels.
