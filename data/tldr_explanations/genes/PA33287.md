PICALM, a gene involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and synaptic function, may impact the effectiveness of Alzheimer's disease treatments, such as cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine), through genetic variations that alter synaptic efficacy. This potential modulation of drug effectiveness underscores the need to consider genetic profiles in the therapeutic planning for neurological conditions.
