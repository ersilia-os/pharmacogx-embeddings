AGAP1 plays a role in cellular processes like vesicle trafficking and may hypothetically affect the pharmacodynamics of risperidone, an antipsychotic drug used for psychiatric disorders, by impacting neurotransmitter receptor trafficking and signaling pathways. Although direct interactions between AGAP1 and risperidone are not established, the gene's influence on cellular functions essential for the drug's efficacy suggests a potential indirect effect on its therapeutic performance, particularly in the central nervous system.
