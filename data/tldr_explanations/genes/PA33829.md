Variations in the HTRA1 gene, which influences critical pathways like the TGF-beta signaling and extracellular matrix composition, can impact the effectiveness and safety of drugs that target these pathways, such as VEGF inhibitors (e.g., ranibizumab, bevacizumab) used in treating age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This suggests that the genetic differences modulate drug efficacy through a pharmacodynamic mechanism, focusing on changes in disease pathways rather than drug metabolism, which underlines the potential for genetic profiling of HTRA1 in personalized medicine.
