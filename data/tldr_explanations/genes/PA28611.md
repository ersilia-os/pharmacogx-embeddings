Variants in the GCKR gene may affect the pharmacodynamics of metformin, a key antidiabetic medication, by altering insulin sensitivity and glucose utilization in the liver, which is critical for customizing treatment for type 2 diabetes. While GCKR does not directly impact the pharmacokinetics of chemotherapy drugs like fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and epirubicin, potential effects on broader metabolic pathways influenced by GCKR could affect how cancer cells respond to these treatments, though direct pharmacogenetic connections appear speculative.
