MTHFD1, involved in folate metabolism, affects the efficacy and toxicity of methotrexate, due to its role in the drug's activation and metabolism, which is a pharmacokinetic interaction. The gene might also influence the effectiveness of doxorubicin by affecting cellular folate levels, related to DNA repair, representing a pharmacodynamic interaction, although this link is less clearly established.
