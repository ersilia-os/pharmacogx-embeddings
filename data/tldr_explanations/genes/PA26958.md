CK2 inhibitors, explored as therapeutic agents in oncology, interact with enzymes like those encoded by CSNK2A1 and CSNK2A2 by inhibiting their activity, which affects crucial cellular processes like cell proliferation and apoptosis. Understanding the genetic variations in CSNK2A1 and CSNK2A2 can be crucial for assessing individual responses to these inhibitors, potentially affecting drug efficacy and safety in cancer treatment.
