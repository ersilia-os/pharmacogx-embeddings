The TBX2 gene, by regulating cell proliferation and suppressing cellular senescence, significantly affects drug responses in cancer treatments, particularly seen in its potential interactions with pathway inhibitors or drugs that impact gene regulation in cancers like melanoma and breast cancer. Additionally, although TBX2's relationship with atenolol, a cardiovascular drug, appears speculative, it could be linked through TBX2’s overall influence on cardiac developmental pathways and signal transduction pathways that are pertinent to the drug’s mechanism of action.
