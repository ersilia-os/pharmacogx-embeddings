Drugs that induce hemolysis increase biliverdin levels, thereby intensifying the function of BLVRB in converting biliverdin to bilirubin; variations in the BLVRB gene may affect how patients respond to such drugs, especially given this gene's role in managing bilirubin levels to prevent complications like jaundice. Moreover, drugs that modulate oxidative stress could indirectly influence BLVRB function, thereby affecting its role in maintaining redox homeostasis.
