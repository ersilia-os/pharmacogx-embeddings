Variations in the REN gene, which codes for renin, influence the effectiveness of drugs targeting the renin-angiotensin system, such as ACE inhibitors (like lisinopril and enalapril) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs like losartan and valsartan), altering their ability to manage blood pressure. Though not directly involved in the renin enzymatic pathway, polymorphisms in the REN gene can also affect the response to hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic used for hypertension, through indirect impacts on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.
