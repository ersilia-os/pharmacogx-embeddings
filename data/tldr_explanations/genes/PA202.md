Variations in the INSR gene can significantly affect the effectiveness and required dosing of insulin therapies and insulin sensitizers like metformin and thiazolidinediones, due to their direct role in metabolic responses and insulin signaling pathways. Additionally, genetic differences in INSR might influence the metabolic effects of drugs like fluorouracil, topiramate, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide, potentially affecting their efficacy and side effects, although these interactions are more related to metabolic pathways rather than the traditional pharmacokinetic processes.
