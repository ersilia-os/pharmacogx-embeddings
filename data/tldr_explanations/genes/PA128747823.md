Variants of the TPH2 gene, which is essential for serotonin synthesis in the brain, significantly affect the action of several antidepressants like SSRIs (fluoxetine, citalopram) and other drugs (venlafaxine, mirtazapine) by altering serotonin levels and thus influencing drug efficacy and side effects. TPH2 also impacts the interaction with non-psychiatric drugs such as heroin and methadone, which can modify neurotransmitter systems, including serotonin, thereby affecting drug outcomes through pharmacodynamic mechanisms.
