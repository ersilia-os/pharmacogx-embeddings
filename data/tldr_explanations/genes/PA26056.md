CAPG, which regulates actin filament dynamics influencing cell motility and morphology in cancers, has no direct pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs. However, it may indirectly affect the activity of drugs such as vincristine, an anti-mitotic agent that disrupts microtubules, by altering cellular behaviors like adhesion and structure that could modulate how cancer cells respond to treatments aimed at preventing cell division. This suggests a non-pharmacokinetic interaction mechanism that could influence therapeutic outcomes.
