Although MKI67 does not directly interact with therapeutic drugs, its expression can be indirectly affected by drugs like abemaciclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor used in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer treatment. This interaction occurs because abemaciclib targets cell cycle kinases involved in the G1 to S phase transition, potentially altering MKI67 levels, which are indicative of cell proliferation rates and can inform on the effectiveness of the treatment.
