Variants in the XPC gene, which is crucial for DNA repair, could affect the efficacy of cancer treatments like doxorubicin, which works by damaging DNA. An altered XPC function may lead to increased sensitivity to such treatments due to decreased DNA repair capability in cells, impacting drug effectiveness at a cellular level through pharmacodynamic mechanisms.
