The PON1 gene influences the metabolism, efficacy, and toxicity of several drugs through its genetic variants affecting enzyme activity. For instance, statins such as simvastatin and fluvastatin may have altered bioavailability due to different hydrolysis rates caused by PON1 variations, while drugs like clopidogrel and aspirin might see changes in their pharmacodynamic effects. Additionally, cytotoxic agents like oxaliplatin and epirubicin, along with other drugs like tacrolimus and fluorouracil, may have their effectiveness or safety altered due to how PON1 modulates oxidative stress and drug metabolism.
