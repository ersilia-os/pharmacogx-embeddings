While the LST1 gene does not directly interact with pharmacokinetics, it may influence the pharmacodynamics of drugs targeting immune and inflammatory processes, such as methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis and abacavir for HIV treatment. Variations in the LST1 gene can affect drug efficacy and adverse reactions by modulating the immune responses these drugs target. Additionally, drugs like ursodeoxycholic acid for liver diseases and rosiglitazone for diabetes could also have differential effects based on LST1-mediated immune adjustments.
