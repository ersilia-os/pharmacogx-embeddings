Drugs such as immunosuppressants and chemotherapy agents used in treating conditions like familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 5 (FHL5) may be impacted by genetic variations in STXBP2, a gene involved in vesicle trafficking and SNARE complex functionality. These interactions can affect the efficacy and toxicity of these treatments by altering cellular responses in immune-modulated conditions, primarily through pharmacodynamic mechanisms related to immune cell function.
