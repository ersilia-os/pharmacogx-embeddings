Hydrochlorothiazide and losartan, used to manage symptoms of nephrotic syndrome such as hypertension and proteinuria, do not interact directly with the NPHS1 gene, which encodes the nephrin protein critical for kidney filtration. Instead, these drugs assist in controlling secondary complications resulting from the impaired function of the filtration barrier where nephrin is compromised, with hydrochlorothiazide managing fluid retention and losartan reducing proteinuria and protecting kidney function.
