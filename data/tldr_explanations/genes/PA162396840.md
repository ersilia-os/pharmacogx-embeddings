Methotrexate and ziprasidone may interact with the NALCN gene, which is involved in maintaining neuronal excitability; methotrexate could affect NALCN activity indirectly due to its systemic effects, while ziprasidone might modulate NALCN by influencing neuronal excitability and neurohormonal pathways. These interactions are pharmacodynamic, focusing on changes in neural activity rather than on drug metabolism or distribution influenced by NALCN.
