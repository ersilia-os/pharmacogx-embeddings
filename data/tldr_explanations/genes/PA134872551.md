The Taq1A polymorphism of the ANKK1 gene significantly affects the pharmacogenetics of several psychotropic drugs, such as Olanzapine, by altering their absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion, which directly impacts their therapeutic outcomes. Other drugs like bupropion, apomorphine, and risperidone interact with the ANKK1-induced variations in dopamine receptor activities and neurotransmitter availability, influencing their efficacy and side effects.
