Drugs that modulate sphingolipid metabolism, specifically ceramides, may have their efficacy and safety profiles altered by the functional status of the CERS6 gene in diseases like cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. This interaction is primarily pharmacodynamic, affecting how drugs influence disease pathways mediated by ceramides, rather than altering the drug metabolism directly.
