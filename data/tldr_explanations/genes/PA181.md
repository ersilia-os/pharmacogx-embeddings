Variants in the NR3C1 gene, which encodes the glucocorticoid receptor, can significantly influence the effectiveness and dosing of glucocorticoids like prednisone, dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and prednisolone by altering receptor sensitivity and response, impacting treatment outcomes for diseases such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus. Additionally, although more speculative, variations in NR3C1 might also affect emotional and physiological responses to drugs like fluoxetine and cocaine through indirect pharmacodynamic interactions.
