Celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor used for its anti-inflammatory properties, may have its effectiveness and safety affected by the activity of the ALOX12 gene, which influences eicosanoid levels involved in inflammation. The interaction between celecoxib and ALOX12 occurs at the pharmacodynamic level, impacting the drug's therapeutic effectiveness through alterations in eicosanoid pathways, rather than through changes in the pharmacokinetics of the drug.
