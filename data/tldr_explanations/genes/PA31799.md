The enzyme NT5C1A, important in the dephosphorylation of monophosphate nucleotides, may affect the efficacy or toxicity of the nucleoside analog drugs cladribine, fluorouracil, and gemcitabine by influencing their conversion processes in the nucleotide salvage pathways. This interaction could alter how these drugs, used in cancer and antiviral therapies, are metabolized and incorporated into DNA or RNA, potentially impacting their therapeutic effectiveness and safety based on individual genetic variations in NT5C1A.
