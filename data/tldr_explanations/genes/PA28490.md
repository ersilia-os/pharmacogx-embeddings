Specific genetic variations in GABRA2 influence the effectiveness and safety of drugs like propofol and cocaine that target the GABAergic system. Propofol enhances GABA_A receptor activity and can result in varying responses based on GABRA2 genetic profiles, affecting anesthetic outcomes, while genetic differences may modify an individual's reaction to cocaine, impacting dependency and withdrawal symptoms through altered GABAergic neurotransmission.
