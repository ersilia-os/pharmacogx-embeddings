The SLC39A8 gene, which aids in the transport of zinc and manganese ions into cells, plays a role in the pharmacokinetics and potentially the pharmacodynamics of drugs that depend on these metal ions, such as those targeting immune or neurological functions or possessing antioxidant properties. Variations in the SLC39A8 gene could influence the effectiveness or toxicity of these drugs by altering the availability of metal ions in the body, which might lead to variability in drug response and necessitate individualized dosage adjustments.
