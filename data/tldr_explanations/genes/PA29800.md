Secukinumab, a biologic drug targeting IL17F and other IL-17 family cytokines, is used to treat autoimmune disorders like psoriasis. The pharmacogenetic interaction involves variability in treatment responses due to genetic differences in the IL17F gene, which can lead to enhanced therapeutic effects or reduced side effects, suggesting the importance of IL17F genotyping for tailoring treatment plans based on genetic makeup.
