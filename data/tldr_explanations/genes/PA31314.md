MUC16, via its biomarker CA-125, plays a crucial role in monitoring ovarian cancer response to chemotherapeutic drugs like carboplatin and paclitaxel. Changes in CA-125 levels, indicative of MUC16 expression, help determine the efficacy of these treatments, guiding oncologists in modifying or continuing with specific chemotherapy strategies based on tumor response.
