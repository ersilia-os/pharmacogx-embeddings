Variations in the expression or mutation of the RBMS3 gene, which acts as a tumor suppressor, can influence the effectiveness of anticancer therapies in cancers like gastric, breast, and colorectal cancers. While there are no specific drugs known to interact directly with RBMS3, it is hypothesized that drugs targeting pathways involved in apoptosis, cellular proliferation, and differentiation might be affected by the functional status of this gene. Treatments that influence transcriptional networks or RNA-binding interactions could have modified efficacy based on RBMS3's condition.
