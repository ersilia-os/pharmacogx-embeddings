MYO1H, a gene encoding the myosin IH protein involved in cellular movements and intracellular transport, has potential pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs affecting muscle function or cellular trafficking, though specific drugs interacting with MYO1H are yet to be documented. The current understanding of how MYO1H influences pharmacodynamics remains speculative due to a lack of direct evidence in pharmacogenetics research.
