TNIK, a gene involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, is targeted by drugs such as NCB-0846 and OTS514 for the treatment of cancers like colorectal and gastric cancers, due to its role in cell proliferation and survival. Additionally, the interaction between TNIK and risperidone—a drug for mental disorders—suggests a pharmacodynamic effect potentially influencing the drug's effectiveness in psychiatric conditions through mechanisms tied to TNIK's role in the central nervous system.
