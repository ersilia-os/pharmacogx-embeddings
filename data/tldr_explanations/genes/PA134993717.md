Pinometostat, a drug that specifically inhibits DOT1L's enzymatic activity, is used in the treatment of leukemia with MLL gene rearrangements by blocking the methylation of histone H3 on lysine 79 (H3K79), which is crucial for the proliferation of leukemic cells. On the other hand, drugs like hydrochlorothiazide and candesartan, commonly used for hypertension, do not have any known pharmacogenetic interactions with the function of DOT1L.
