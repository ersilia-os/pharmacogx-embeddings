NOS1 genetic variations can affect the processing and effectiveness of chemotherapy drugs like fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide by influencing nitric oxide (NO) production, which is crucial in protecting against cellular damage and regulating vascular tone. Changes in NO levels due to increased oxidative stress from chemotherapy can exacerbate drug toxicity or diminish effectiveness, indicating that adjustments in therapy might be necessary based on specific NOS1 genetic profiles.
