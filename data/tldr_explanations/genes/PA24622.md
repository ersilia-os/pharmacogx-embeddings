Although AGPAT2 does not have direct pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs, its role in lipid metabolism and adipocyte function suggests that drugs targeting lipid disorders or insulin resistance, such as statins, metformin, and pioglitazone, might have varying efficacy due to indirect influences on AGPAT2-related pathways. This gene's involvement in broader metabolic conditions indirectly affects how these drugs interact within the body, rather than through direct drug-gene interactions.
