SULT1C4, a sulfotransferase family gene involved in metabolism and detoxification, may indirectly influence the metabolism of drugs like docetaxel and thalidomide, increasing their water solubility and facilitating excretion. However, the specific role of SULT1C4 in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these drugs is not well-defined and requires further research.
