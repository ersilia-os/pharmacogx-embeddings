CYP1A2 plays a pivotal role in the pharmacokinetics of drugs, influencing their metabolism and, consequently, efficacy and safety. This enzyme is responsible for processing medications such as clozapine, theophylline, caffeine, erlotinib, deferasirox, escitalopram, and clopidogrel, where genetic variability can significantly affect therapeutic outcomes and requires careful dosage adjustments to prevent toxicity or enhance drug effectiveness.
