SLCO1B3, which encodes the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3), plays a crucial role in the hepatic uptake and metabolism of several drugs including docetaxel, mycophenolate mofetil, telmisartan, and voriconazole, affecting their plasma levels, therapeutic effects, and toxicity. Variants in this gene can modify the transport efficiency of these drugs, influencing their absorption, distribution, elimination, and overall pharmacokinetics, thereby necessitating tailored dosing in personalized medicine to enhance efficacy and reduce adverse effects.
