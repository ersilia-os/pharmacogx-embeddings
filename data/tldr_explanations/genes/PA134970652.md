The drug methylphenidate, used for ADHD, is metabolized primarily by liver enzymes such as CYP2D6, and while not well-documented, there is speculation that ZNF565 could affect its metabolism through its role in regulating the expression of genes for these enzymes. This interaction, however, remains speculative without direct evidence showing ZNF565â€™s influence on these pathways.
