The gene PPP1R18, which regulates the activity and specificity of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), may influence the pharmacodynamics of cancer treatment drugs carboplatin and gemcitabine by affecting PP1's role in DNA repair and cell division control. This impact on PP1 could, thereby, modulate the effectiveness of these drugs by dictating the level of drug-induced cytotoxicity in rapidly dividing cancer cells, primarily through biochemical pathway modulation rather than changes in drug metabolism or excretion.
