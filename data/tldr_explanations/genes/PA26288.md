The gene CDH15 (Cadherin 15) does not have direct pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions with drugs such as clopidogrel or aspirin, but its role in muscle and neural tissues could indirectly influence the body's response to these medications. Any potential effects are likely through indirect physiological interactions affecting muscle or neural integrity rather than direct genetic interactions with these drugs.
