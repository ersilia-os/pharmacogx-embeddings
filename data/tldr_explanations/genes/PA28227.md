Although FOXF2, a transcription factor, does not have direct, established pharmacogenetic interactions with particular drugs, its involvement in processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumor suppression potentially influences the pharmacodynamics of therapies targeting these pathways. The indirect effect of FOXF2 on drug interactions primarily pertains to its role in diseases like colorectal cancer, where it acts as a tumor suppressor, suggesting that drugs aiming to affect tumor growth or tissue differentiation might be impacted by changes in FOXF2's expression or function.
