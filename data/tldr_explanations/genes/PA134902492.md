PGLYRP4, a gene involved in immune response and inflammation, may influence the effectiveness and safety of drugs like corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and antibiotics that target bacterial cell walls by affecting how these drugs modulate immune system pathways. The gene's role suggests it could alter the pharmacodynamic profiles of these drugs, impacting their efficacy due to changes in the body's immune response, rather than affecting the drugs' pharmacokinetic properties.
