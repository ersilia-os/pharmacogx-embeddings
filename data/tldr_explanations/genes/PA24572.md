The ADH1C gene, important in ethanol metabolism through its encoding enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase 1C, interacts with drugs like naltrexone by possibly influencing opioid receptor pathways involved in alcohol dependence, rather than directly affecting drug metabolism. Furthermore, ADH1C's role extends to affecting the therapeutic response or toxicity of drugs such as cyclophosphamide through its involvement in oxidative stress pathways, despite not directly metabolizing the drug.
