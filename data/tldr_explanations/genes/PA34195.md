Drugs such as Nutlin-3, which activate p53 by targeting the p53-MDM2 interaction, may have varying effects based on PPP1R13L expression, which also influences the efficacy of chemotherapy agents like docetaxel, oxaliplatin, and gemcitabine. The interactions primarily involve pharmacodynamics, with PPP1R13L altering cancer cell responses to treatment by affecting apoptosis and immune system modulation, rather than changing how drugs are metabolized or distributed.
