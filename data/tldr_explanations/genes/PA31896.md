The pharmacogenetic relevance of the OCRL gene is more about its role in genetic disorders such as Lowe Syndrome and Dent disease, rather than direct drug interactions. However, its role in kidney function suggests that variants in OCRL could potentially influence the renal handling and toxicity of drugs like tenofovir, known for renal side effects, indicating an indirect impact on drug pharmacokinetics or dynamics.
