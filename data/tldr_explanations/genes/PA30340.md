The pharmacogenetic relevance of the LGALS3 gene, which encodes Galectin-3, mostly pertains to its role in modulating diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases rather than direct interactions with drugs. Pravastatin, a cholesterol-lowering statin with anti-inflammatory properties, does not directly target LGALS3 but may indirectly influence Galectin-3's role in inflammatory processes, potentially affecting disease outcomes in conditions like cardiovascular disease where Galectin-3 is implicated.
