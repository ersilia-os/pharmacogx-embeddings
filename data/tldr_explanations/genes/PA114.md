The CHRNA7 gene, encoding the alpha7 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, affects the efficacy of drugs such as rivastigmine, donepezil, nicotine, and galantamine by modulating receptor activity in cognitive and neural disorders. Rivastigmine and donepezil enhance cholinergic neurotransmission through acetylcholinesterase inhibition, increasing acetylcholine to activate these receptors, while nicotine and galantamine directly and allosterically activate and modulate these receptors, impacting neural plasticity and cognitive functions.
