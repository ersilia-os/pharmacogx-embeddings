The SLC47A1 gene, which encodes the MATE1 transporter protein, plays a crucial role in the renal and hepatic excretion of drugs such as metformin, cimetidine, and ganciclovir. Variations in this gene can alter the clearance and pharmacokinetics of these drugs, impacting their therapeutic efficacy and the risk of side effects, thereby underscoring its significance in personalized medicine and drug therapy management.
