Belzutifan, a drug used to treat cancers like renal cell carcinomas associated with VHL gene dysfunctions, functions by inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF-2Î±). This action effectively mimics the tumor suppressing role of the functional VHL gene by limiting HIF activity, which is pivotal in tumor progression through processes like angiogenesis when VHL is deficient or inactive. This therapeutic mechanism targets protein expression and activity rather than altering the drug's pharmacokinetics.
