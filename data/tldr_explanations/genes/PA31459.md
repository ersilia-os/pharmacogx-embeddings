The antidepressant duloxetine might interact indirectly with the gene NCAM1, which is involved in neural development and synaptic plasticity, potentially affecting the drug's efficacy in treating disorders like depression and generalized anxiety. This interaction is likely pharmacodynamic, focusing on changes in neuroadaptive pathways related to NCAM1's role in neuronal connections and plasticity, although direct evidence is lacking.
