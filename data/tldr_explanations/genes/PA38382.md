TIGD1, associated with genomic stability potentially relevant to DNA damage responses, is speculatively linked to influencing the actions of the chemotherapeutic agents carboplatin and paclitaxel, though clear mechanistic interactions have not been established. Carboplatin facilitates DNA crosslinking leading to apoptosis, while paclitaxel stabilizes microtubules to disrupt cell division, with TIGD1 possibly modulating DNA repair or cell cycle regulation in these contexts.
