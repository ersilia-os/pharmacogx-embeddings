The F11 gene, which encodes Coagulation Factor XI, is crucial for understanding the interactions and efficacy of anticoagulation therapies in patients with disorders like Hemophilia C. Specific genetic variants of F11 can affect responses to general anticoagulants and may necessitate the use of Factor XI concentrates during surgery, while new drugs such as the Factor XI inhibitor abelacimab offer targeted modulation of coagulation processes, which could improve treatment personalization and safety.
