Although there are no direct pharmacogenetic interactions between the gene MAP4K4 and specific drugs, its involvement in regulating pathways relevant to cancer and cardiovascular diseases suggests potential indirect pharmacodynamic interactions. Drugs such as anastrozole and exemestane, which are aromatase inhibitors used in hormone-sensitive breast cancer treatment, could have their efficacy modulated by variations in MAP4K4 expression or activity, affecting cellular behaviors like proliferation rates or apoptosis, despite no direct involvement in drug metabolism or distribution.
