Although there is no direct evidence linking the ZNF789 gene to the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the immunosuppressant drug tacrolimus, ZNF789's role in regulating gene expression suggests it could indirectly affect tacrolimus's effectiveness and toxicity by potentially influencing the expression of genes involved in the drug's metabolism or action. This interaction likely occurs through a cascade of gene expression modulations rather than through direct handling of the drug.
