CORO7, involved in intracellular processes and potentially linked to neurological functions, may indirectly affect the pharmacodynamics of drugs like methylphenidate, which is used for ADHD. This interaction is speculated due to CORO7's role in neuronal function and intracellular trafficking, potentially influencing drug efficacy by affecting neurotransmitter systems at the cellular level, rather than through standard pharmacokinetic processes.
