Imiquimod, a drug used to treat human papillomavirus-induced warts and basal cell carcinoma, acts as a TLR7 agonist to enhance antiviral and anticancer immunity by stimulating immune cells to produce type I interferons and other cytokines. Variability in the TLR7 gene due to genetic polymorphisms can affect the drug's efficacy and safety, with some variants facilitating a more effective therapeutic response and others potentially causing excessive inflammatory reactions.
