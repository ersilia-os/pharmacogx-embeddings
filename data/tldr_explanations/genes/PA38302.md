TXNRD2, or Thioredoxin Reductase 2, influences the effectiveness and safety of certain drugs by playing a role in cellular redox homeostasis and response to oxidative stress. Variants of this gene could notably interact with opioids such as heroin, morphine, and methadone, the antidepressant bupropion, and the antipsychotic risperidone; these drugs may impact the enzymatic activity of TXNRD2 either through changes in respiratory function, stress response, neurotransmitter pathways, mitochondrial function, or other oxidative stress mechanisms.
