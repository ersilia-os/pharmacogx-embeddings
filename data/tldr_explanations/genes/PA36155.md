Somatostatin analogs like octreotide and lanreotide interact with the SSTR2 gene by binding to it and inhibiting excessive hormone secretion, which is beneficial in treating conditions like neuroendocrine tumors, acromegaly, and carcinoid syndrome-related severe diarrhea. However, variations in SSTR2 expression and genetic variants may affect the efficacy and safety of these treatments, as different variants can alter receptor binding affinity and expression levels, influencing therapeutic outcomes and side effects.
