The gene PON2, involved in oxidative stress regulation and lipid metabolism, may affect the efficacy and metabolism of statinsâ€”drugs used to manage cholesterol and prevent cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, PON2 gene variations might also interact with other lipid-altering agents such as fibrates or niacin, and possibly influence the effectiveness of drugs used in antioxidant therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, primarily through pharmacodynamic interactions.
