FXR2, a gene linked to neural development and neuropsychiatric disorders, may interact non-pharmacokinetically with methylphenidate (used for treating ADHD) by potentially influencing synaptic modulation and neural pathways, thus affecting how the drug manages symptoms through enhanced brain dopamine and norepinephrine levels. This interaction does not directly alter drug metabolism but suggests the need to explore FXR2's role in the drug's effectiveness in treating neuropsychiatric conditions.
