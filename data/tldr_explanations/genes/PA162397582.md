Vincristine, a chemotherapeutic drug, potentially interacts with the gene NKAIN3, which regulates neural ion transport. This interaction, likely influencing vincristine’s pharmacodynamics, could exacerbate the drug’s neurotoxic side effects due to altered ion transport from NKAIN3 dysfunction or variations.
