The gene SLCO1A2 significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of drugs like rocuronium, imatinib, and methotrexate by mediating their hepatic uptake, which alters their effectiveness, safety, and systemic clearance. Rocuronium's performance in anesthesia, imatinib's therapeutic outcomes in cancer treatment, and methotrexate's response in treating malignancies and autoimmune disorders are all influenced by variations in SLCO1A2 activity, impacting their hepatic clearance and overall drug dynamics.
