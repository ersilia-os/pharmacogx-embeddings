Daratumumab and Isatuximab are monoclonal antibodies that target the CD38 protein, which is encoded by the CD38 gene and expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma cells. These drugs work through pharmacodynamic interactions, inducing apoptosis and immune-mediated destruction of myeloma cells, with their efficacy significantly dependent on the expression levels of CD38.
