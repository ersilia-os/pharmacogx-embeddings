EHF's role in regulating epithelial cell function and inflammatory responses suggests that genetic variations in EHF could indirectly affect the response or adverse effects of the drug ziprasidone, particularly in patients with compromised epithelial barriers or susceptibility to respiratory side effects. This interaction, though not direct, might influence ziprasidone's effectiveness or toxicity through altered epithelial or immune responses in certain patient subsets.
