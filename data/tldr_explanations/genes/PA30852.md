Drugs targeting epigenetic modification or transcriptional elongation, such as inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases or histone deacetylases, could have varying efficacy in treating cancers like acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) due to how MLLT3-related chromosomal translocations disrupt gene regulation pathways. Montelukast, typically used as a leukotriene receptor antagonist for asthma, is also mentioned, but its direct interaction with MLLT3 is unclear and may suggest a potential novel pathway not yet fully understood.
