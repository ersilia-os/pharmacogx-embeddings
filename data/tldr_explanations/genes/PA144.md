DPEP1, a kidney enzyme important in glutathione metabolism, might affect the metabolism of drugs like paracetamol, altering their efficacy and toxicity due to potential changes in glutathione conjugate processing. Additionally, variations in DPEP1 could impact the degradation of leukotriene B4, thereby affecting the effectiveness of inflammatory pathway-targeting drugs like zileuton, used in asthma management.
