TLR2, primarily involved in immune response activation, does not directly interact with drugs pharmacokinetically, but its role in the immune system may influence the pharmacodynamics of drugs like morphine, which modulates immune function. Variations in TLR2 gene expression can potentially affect morphineâ€™s ability to suppress the immune system, hence affecting clinical outcomes for individuals with different TLR2 genotypes undergoing treatment for conditions requiring immune modulation, such as post-operative recovery or chronic pain management.
