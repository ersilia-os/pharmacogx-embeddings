Variability in the ADRB1 gene, due to polymorphisms such as Ser49Gly and Arg389Gly, affects interactions with beta-blockers like metoprolol, atenolol, carvedilol, and bucindolol, significantly influencing their efficacy in treating cardiovascular conditions including hypertension and heart failure. This genetic variation leads to differences in drug efficacy, such as heart rate reduction and symptom improvement, thereby guiding personalized treatment approaches. Additionally, other cardiovascular drugs like digoxin and verapamil may interact with ADRB1, generally through adrenergic signaling pathways affecting processes like cardiac contractility and rhythm stability.
