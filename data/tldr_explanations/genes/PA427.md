The gene CYP3A43, although not a major player in drug metabolism compared to other enzymes in its subfamily, is known to have specific pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs like olanzapine and ticagrelor, influencing their clearance and plasma concentrations to a minor degree. Its interactions with other antipsychotic drugs such as quetiapine, haloperidol, aripiprazole, risperidone, and clozapine are less defined and are likely related to broader metabolic pathways or pharmacodynamic responses, where CYP3A43 plays a marginal role.
