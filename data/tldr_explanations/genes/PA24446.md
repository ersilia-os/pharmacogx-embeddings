Variants of the ACP1 gene can influence responses to antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia treatment and to anti-inflammatory drugs, likely due to the gene's role in neuronal and immune signaling pathways. These pharmacogenetic interactions suggest that ACP1 genetic variability could be used to personalize treatment strategies, optimizing drug efficacy and reducing side effects in these medications.
