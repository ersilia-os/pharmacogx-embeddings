The SLCO1C1 gene encodes a protein that transports thyroid hormones like thyroxine (T4) across membranes such as the blood-brain barrier, affecting the pharmacokinetics of drugs that rely on similar transport mechanisms. Drugs that inhibit or induce the function of this transporter could potentially alter thyroxine levels, impacting the treatment and outcomes in conditions where thyroid hormone balance is essential, such as hypothyroidism; this interaction may also influence the distribution and efficacy of drugs targeting the central nervous system.
