The gene ZNF423 significantly influences the effectiveness of hormone-based therapies such as tamoxifen and raloxifene, used in breast cancer treatment and prevention, by modulating estrogen receptor signaling pathways. This interaction can alter the pharmacodynamics of these drugs, potentially affecting their ability to suppress tumor growth and highlighting the importance of ZNF423 as a biomarker for predicting therapeutic outcomes in personalized medicine.
