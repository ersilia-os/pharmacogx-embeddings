Genetic variations in the TOP1 gene significantly influence the efficacy and toxicity of the topoisomerase inhibitors topotecan and irinotecan, used in treating cancers such as lung, ovarian, and colorectal. These variations affect the enzyme's activity or stability, thereby modifying the drugs' ability to induce DNA damage in cancer cells, with implications for personalized treatment strategies to maximize efficacy and minimize adverse effects.
