CYP2J2, primarily involved in metabolizing polyunsaturated fatty acids affecting cardiovascular physiology, does not have well-documented direct pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs like mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus. However, its role in modulating vascular tone and inflammation could potentially influence the pharmacodynamics of these immunosuppressive drugs used in organ transplantation and autoimmune diseases, despite the lack of a direct metabolic pathway involving CYP2J2.
