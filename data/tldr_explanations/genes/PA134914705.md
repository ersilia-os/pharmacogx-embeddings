The gene COL22A1, which is crucial for the structure of muscle and tendon junctions through the production of collagen XXII, has a speculative interaction with salbutamol, a bronchodilator used primarily for asthma. Although salbutamol typically affects beta-2 adrenergic receptors to relax airway smooth muscles, it is theorized that it might also impact muscle and connective tissue where COL22A1 is expressed, potentially affecting musculoskeletal dynamics and recovery, though more research is required to confirm this.
