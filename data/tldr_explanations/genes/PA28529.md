The gene GAL, which encodes the galanin peptide involved in neuroendocrine functions, may influence the effects of drugs like heroin and mirtazapine due to its role in modulating neurotransmitter systems. Heroin's impact on pain perception could be mediated by galanin pathways, while variations in GAL could affect mirtazapine's efficacy in treating psychiatric conditions by altering neurotransmitter levels, indicating a pharmacodynamic interaction.
