ETS2, a significant transcription factor, impacts the effectiveness of cancer drugs like carboplatin, gemcitabine, and paclitaxel due to its regulatory roles in DNA repair, cell cycle, and apoptosis pathways. The expression or mutation status of ETS2 may modify the efficacy and resistance to these therapies, suggesting a pharmacogenetic interaction that influences both the pharmacodynamics and potentially the pharmacokinetics of these treatments.
