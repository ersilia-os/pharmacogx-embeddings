EGFR interacts pharmacogenetically with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib, where activating mutations enhance efficacy, but the T790M mutation causes resistance, requiring use of third-generation TKIs like osimertinib to counteract it. Additionally, drugs like mobocertinib, sorafenib, and regorafenib have complex interaction dynamics with EGFR, while chemotherapeutic agents like carboplatin and paclitaxel might see synergistic benefits when combined with EGFR inhibitors, enhancing cytotoxic effects.
