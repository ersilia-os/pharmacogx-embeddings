HMGCS2, a gene involved in ketone body production, has not been directly linked to pharmacogenetic interactions with specific medications, although its role in metabolism may indirectly influence the pharmacodynamics of diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, and chlorothiazide. These drugs mainly impact renal fluid and electrolyte balance but could indirectly affect metabolic pathways, suggesting a complex interaction more related to metabolic effects than direct drug handling processes like absorption or excretion.
