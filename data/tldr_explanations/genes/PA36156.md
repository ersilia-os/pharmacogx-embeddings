The SSTR3 gene, encoding for Somatostatin Receptor 3, influences the efficacy and safety of somatostatin analogs like octreotide and lanreotide by affecting their pharmacodynamic interactions. These interactions include hormone secretion modulation and tumor growth inhibition via the activation of the somatostatin signaling pathway, resulting in variable therapeutic outcomes due to genetic variations in SSTR3.
