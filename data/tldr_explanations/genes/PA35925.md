SLC7A7, a gene involved in amino acid transport, does not directly interact with drugs in a pharmacokinetic manner but indirectly influences drug efficacy and toxicity through its impact on amino acid availability in the body. In cases of dysfunction such as Lysinuric Protein Intolerance, treatments like citrulline supplements for hyperammonemia may require dose adjustments due to altered amino acid transport, although no drugs are directly associated with pharmacogenetic interactions linked to SLC7A7 function.
