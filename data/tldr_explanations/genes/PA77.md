Tramadol and its more potent metabolite o-desmethyltramadol interact pharmacokinetically with the HCN1 gene, which regulates neuronal excitability and pain signaling pathways. This interaction, primarily through HCN1 channels, influences the drug's metabolism and efficacy in pain management by altering the electrical threshold for pain signals, potentially affecting therapeutic outcomes and requiring dosage adjustments.
