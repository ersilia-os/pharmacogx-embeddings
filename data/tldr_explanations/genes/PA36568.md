Risperidone, an antipsychotic used for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, might interact with the gene TMEFF2, which is involved in neuroendocrine functions and expressed in the brain. This interaction could influence the drug's pharmacodynamics, possibly by affecting neurological pathways mediated by TMEFF2 or by changes in TMEFF2 expression altering the drug response, though this interaction is not yet well-documented or studied in detail.
