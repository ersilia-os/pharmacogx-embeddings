AHRR influences the pharmacokinetics of drugs like theophylline and clozapine through its suppressive effect on the enzyme CYP1A1, leading to potentially altered drug efficacy and toxicity due to slower metabolism and increased plasma concentrations. It also interacts with methotrexate, affecting its effectiveness or toxicity through non-pharmacokinetic pathways related to AHRR's roles in cell growth and apoptosis, indicating a complex pharmacogenetic impact on drug response.
