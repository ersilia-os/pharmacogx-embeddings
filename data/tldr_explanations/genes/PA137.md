Deoxycytidine Kinase (DCK) is fundamental in the metabolism of anticancer drugs like gemcitabine and cytarabine, as variations in the DCK gene affect the transformation of these drugs into their active forms, pivotal for their effectiveness and potential resistance in cancer treatment. For gemcitabine and the ara-CTP metabolite of cytarabine, DCK facilitates their activation through phosphorylation processes, influencing drug efficacy and toxicity in treatments for cancers such as pancreatic, breast, non-small cell lung cancers, and leukemias.
