The gene CYB5R1 influences the metabolism of drugs like dapsone, benzocaine, and primaquine by affecting their ability to reduce methemoglobin, thereby impacting drug efficacy and safety. Variations in this gene can also affect the therapeutic outcomes of drugs such as metoclopramide and isosorbide nitrates by altering redox balance and related metabolic pathways.
