Polymorphisms in the ADD1 gene influence the efficacy of diuretics like hydrochlorothiazide by affecting sodium transport in the kidneys, leading to variable drug responses in hypertension management. While other diuretics such as furosemide and spironolactone interact with ADD1, these relationships mainly relate to their role in sodium and fluid regulation, with specific genetic interactions less documented.
