The ABCC12 gene, though part of the ABC transporter family known for drug transport and resistance roles, particularly in oncology, has no well-documented interactions with clinical drugs. Its potential influence on the effectiveness and distribution of anticancer drugs remains theoretical and speculative, with no direct evidence linking ABCC12 to specific pharmacogenetic impacts on drug response, metabolism, or resistance in existing literature.
