The Y402H polymorphism in the gene CFH increases susceptibility to Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), affecting the efficacy of complement inhibitors, which are more effective or necessary based on individual CFH genetic profiles. In atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS), characterized by uncontrolled complement activation due to CFH anomalies, the drug Eculizumab, targeting complement protein C5, shows varying effectiveness depending on CFH genetic variations, highlighting a pharmacodynamic interaction where the genetic profile influences drug response and effectiveness.
