Drugs that affect DNA repair mechanisms or target the mutagenic vulnerabilities of cancer cells may have varying efficacy based on the expression levels of APOBEC3B, a gene involved in genomic instability and innate immune responses. Understanding APOBEC3B activity can be crucial for optimizing cancer treatments using DNA-damaging agents or therapies that target DNA repair pathways, as well as potentially enhancing the effectiveness of conventional chemotherapeutics by using inhibitors to decrease APOBEC3B activity and reduce mutation rates in cancers.
