UGT1A7, an enzyme involved in drug metabolism, significantly influences the effectiveness and safety of drugs such as atorvastatin, axitinib, valproic acid, and methotrexate by affecting their clearance and plasma levels. Variations in UGT1A7 activity can lead to diverse therapeutic outcomes and adverse effects, like muscle and liver toxicity, by altering the metabolism of these drugs, indicating the need for careful consideration of UGT1A7 variability in drug prescription and therapy management.
