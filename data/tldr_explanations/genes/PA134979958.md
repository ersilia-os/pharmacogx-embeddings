Mutations in the CPOX gene, which play a crucial role in heme synthesis, can impact the hepatic metabolic capacity to process drugs via the cytochrome P450 system. Drugs like barbiturates, sulfonamides, and steroids, which induce hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, may exacerbate conditions like hereditary coproporphyria in patients with CPOX mutations by increasing demands on heme synthesis and potentially overwhelming compromised enzymatic function, leading to heightened porphyric crises.
