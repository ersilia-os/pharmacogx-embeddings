The ABCC3 gene significantly influences the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs such as methotrexate and morphine by affecting their transport. Variants in ABCC3 can lead to altered excretion of methotrexate, which affects its effectiveness and side effects, and can modify the transport of morphine and its metabolites, impacting their systemic and neurological effects. Other chemotherapy drugs like doxorubicin and vincristine may also interact with ABCC3, potentially influencing drug efficacy and resistance through effects on drug efflux.
