Though RIPOR2 is mainly involved in cell polarization and cytoskeletal organization, it does not have a confirmed direct interaction with drugs affecting pharmacokinetics. However, it might have a non-pharmacokinetic interaction with rifampin, an antibiotic for tuberculosis, potentially influencing immune responses indirectly due to RIPOR2's role in immune cell functioning, which could affect the efficacy or side effect profile of rifampin in conditions with abnormal immune cell activities.
