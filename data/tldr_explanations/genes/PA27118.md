CYP4A11, a gene involved in fatty acid metabolism, has potential pharmacogenetic implications in hypertension treatment, particularly through indirect interactions with potassium-sparing diuretics like spironolactone and amiloride. These interactions are speculated to involve modulation of hormonal pathways or ion transport mechanisms, rather than direct metabolism by the enzyme, affecting fluid and electrolyte balance critical for blood pressure regulation.
