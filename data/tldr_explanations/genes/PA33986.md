The effectiveness of targeted cancer therapies like azacitidine can be influenced by mutations in the PTPN11 gene, which plays a significant role in the RAS/MAPK signaling pathways and impacts cellular growth and differentiation. While PTPN11 does not show direct pharmacokinetic interactions, its mutations are crucial in pharmacodynamic interactions that affect how cells respond to treatments, emphasizing the need for personalized treatment based on the mutational status of PTPN11 in cancers such as juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.
