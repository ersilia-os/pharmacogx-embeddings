CHRNA4, encoding the alpha-4 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, significantly affects pharmacogenetics by modulating responses to nicotine and varenicline. Variants in CHRNA4 can alter receptor sensitivity, impacting nicotine addiction and the effectiveness of smoking cessation drugs, where nicotine enhances dopamine release and varenicline acts as a partial agonist to reduce nicotine craving and minimize smoking's rewarding effects.
