UGT2A1, a gene in the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase family involved in detoxification, might influence the pharmacokinetics of drugs like imatinib, which is metabolized through glucuronidation by related enzymes. Although there is no direct evidence linking UGT2A1 with imatinib, variations in UGT2A1 could potentially affect imatinib's metabolism, efficacy, and toxicity, even if the exact relationship remains speculative and unconfirmed.
