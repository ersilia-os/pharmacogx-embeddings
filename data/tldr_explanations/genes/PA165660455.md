Drugs such as sirolimus and everolimus, which target the mTOR signaling pathway, may have varying levels of efficacy and side effect profiles influenced by mutations or expression levels of the gene RICTOR. Given RICTOR's role in controlling kinase activity, its expression or functional changes can modulate the pharmacodynamics of these drugs, thereby impacting their effectiveness in treating cancers like breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers due to its influence on cell proliferation and survival pathways.
