Heroin and methadone, drugs that primarily impact the central nervous system and influence pain perception and emotional states, have indirect interactions with NGF through potential non-pharmacokinetic mechanisms. Altered NGF signaling, possibly due to genetic factors, might modify the sensitivity or pathological responses to these opioids, particularly in the context of pain pathways and neuronal health, potentially affecting treatment outcomes or dependency traits.
