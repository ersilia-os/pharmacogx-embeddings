UGT1A6 is a key enzyme involved in the metabolism of several drugs through glucuronidation, influencing their solubility and excretion. Specific genetic variants of UGT1A6 can alter the metabolism and effectiveness of drugs like atorvastatin and acetaminophen, potentially affecting their efficacy and toxicity. Additionally, it processes drugs such as valproic acid, methotrexate, aspirin, and other NSAIDs, where genetic differences can impact drug levels, exposure, and side effect profiles, playing a significant role in pharmacokinetics and potentially pharmacodynamics.
