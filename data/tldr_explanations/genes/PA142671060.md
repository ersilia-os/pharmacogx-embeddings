DROSHA, an enzyme critical in the microRNA biogenesis pathway, indirectly influences drug response in chemotherapy by affecting miRNA processing, which regulates gene expression linked to the metabolism and action of drugs such as cytarabine, prednisone, daunorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, mercaptopurine, and methotrexate. Variations in DROSHA could alter the maturation of miRNAs that regulate proteins crucial for the pharmacodynamics of these drugs, thus impacting their therapeutic effectiveness and side effect profiles.
