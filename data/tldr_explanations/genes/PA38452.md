CYP39A1, primarily involved in cholesterol metabolism, has no well-documented interactions with pharmaceutical drugs that alter their pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. The enzyme's role in drug metabolism is minor compared to other cytochrome P450 enzymes, with no specific drugs identified that show a pharmacogenetic interaction affecting drug efficacy or toxicity through metabolism.
