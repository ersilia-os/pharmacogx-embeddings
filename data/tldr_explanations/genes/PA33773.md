PRKCQ plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses, particularly in T-cell signaling, making it important in treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer immunotherapy. Drugs do not target PRKCQ directly but influence T-cell activity pharmacodynamically through associated pathways, such as NF-kB, with genetic variations in PRKCQ potentially affecting the personalization and efficacy of these treatments.
