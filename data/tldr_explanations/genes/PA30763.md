The effectiveness of drugs such as crizotinib, capmatinib, and tepotinib, which target the MET signaling pathway, varies in cancer therapy based on genetic variants of the MET gene. These drugs are impactful in dealing with cancers like non-small cell lung cancer, especially when mutations such as MET exon 14 skipping are present, highlighting the critical role of genetic testing to optimize treatment outcomes.
