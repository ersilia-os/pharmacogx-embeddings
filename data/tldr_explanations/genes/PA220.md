The KCNMA1 gene encodes the BK channel which regulates neuronal and smooth muscle activity, with pharmacogenetic interactions including drugs like quetiapine potentially affecting neuronal excitability indirectly through pharmacodynamic pathways, despite no direct pharmacokinetic interaction. Additionally, drugs such as paxilline and iberiotoxin directly interact with BK channels by inhibiting them, illustrating the impact of BK channel modulation on therapeutic outcomes.
