The CDC5L gene influences the efficacy of the anticancer drug gemcitabine by affecting cell division and gene expression regulation, which are crucial for cancer cells' sensitivity to the drug. While gemcitabine disrupts DNA synthesis by integrating into DNA of dividing cells, CDC5L's role in regulating these cell cycles could alter how cancer cells respond to gemcitabine, potentially impacting drug resistance or sensitivity.
