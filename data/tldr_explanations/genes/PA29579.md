The synthetic amylin analog, pramlintide, used in diabetes management, mimics the natural actions of IAPP or amylin to improve glycemic control by inhibiting glucagon secretion, slowing gastric emptying, and promoting satiety. The pharmacogenetic interactions concerning IAPP primarily involve gene variations affecting amylin's amyloid fiber aggregation, crucial in diabetes pathology and potentially modifying the response to treatments like pramlintide; however, the pharmacogenetic link with rocuronium is not well established and may not directly relate to IAPP pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics.
