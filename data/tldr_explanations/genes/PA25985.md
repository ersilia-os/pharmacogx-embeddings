Fluticasone propionate and montelukast, drugs typically not interacting through carbonic anhydrase mechanisms, may pharmacodynamically interact with the gene CA10, which is expressed in brain tissues and involved in neurological processes. These interactions are speculated to potentially affect neurological inflammation and signaling pathways, given CA10's non-catalytic role and neural expression profile.
