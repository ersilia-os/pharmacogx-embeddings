The gene ZPR1 is implicated in drug interactions, particularly with JAK inhibitors and fenofibrate, affecting their effectiveness or toxicity due to its role in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and cell survival pathways. These interactions are significant in conditions like immune disorders, cancers, and neurodegenerative diseases, potentially influencing therapy outcomes based on variations in ZPR1 expression or function.
