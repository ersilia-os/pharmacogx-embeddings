The JAK2 V617F mutation in myeloproliferative neoplasms enhances abnormal cell proliferation via the JAK-STAT pathway, and its pharmacogenetic interactions with JAK inhibitors like ruxolitinib and fedratinib are crucial. These drugs work by inhibiting JAK2 kinase activity, thereby decreasing signal transduction in the JAK-STAT pathway and reducing abnormal cell proliferation in conditions such as polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and myelofibrosis, with their effectiveness varying based on specific JAK2 mutations.
