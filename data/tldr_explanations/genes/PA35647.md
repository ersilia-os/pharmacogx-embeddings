The gene SEMA3C, involved in axonal guidance and angiogenesis, plays a role in cancer progression and has implications for cancer therapies, particularly through its involvement in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. Although SEMA3C is not directly targeted by existing drugs, it may be indirectly affected by drugs like irinotecan, an antineoplastic enzyme inhibitor, which influences SEMA3C pathways by altering the tumor environment; however, the exact mechanisms of this interaction are not fully understood.
