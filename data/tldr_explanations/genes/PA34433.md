PCGF3, primarily involved in epigenetic regulation and linked to cancer pathways, might interact indirectly with enalapril, a drug used for hypertension and heart failure. The connection, likely through non-pharmacokinetic pathways such as epigenetic mechanisms, could involve effects on vascular or cardiac remodeling or drug responsiveness, although the precise pathways and effects are not yet clearly understood.
