The PPARA gene is crucial in lipid metabolism and its genetic variations significantly alter the effectiveness and safety of fibrate drugs such as fenofibrate and gemfibrozil, by affecting their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. These fibrate drugs target and activate PPARA to enhance lipid breakdown, but their interactions can also extend to other non-fibrate drugs like statins and metformin, potentially due to overlapping metabolic pathways and regulatory mechanisms linked to lipid metabolism.
