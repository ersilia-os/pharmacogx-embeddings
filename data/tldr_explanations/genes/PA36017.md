Drugs such as doxorubicin, which generates reactive oxygen species, may have altered efficacy or toxicity based on variations in SOD2 genotypes, impacting the balance of oxidative stress and influencing therapeutic outcomes. Other drugs like docetaxel, epirubicin, paclitaxel, and several more, though their interactions with SOD2 are less clearly defined, may also require adjusted dosing or careful monitoring due to potential modulation of oxidative stress responses in individuals with specific SOD2 genotypes.
