The effectiveness of certain anticancer drugs, including mTOR inhibitors like everolimus and temsirolimus, and chemotherapeutic agents such as fluorouracil, carboplatin, and capecitabine, can be significantly influenced by mutations or deletions in the PTEN gene. These drugs interact with the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is modulated by PTEN, and its alteration can lead to varied therapeutic responses, impacting the overall success of treatment in cancers like renal cell carcinoma and breast cancer.
