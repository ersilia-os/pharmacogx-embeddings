Drugs used to manage epilepsy and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may interact differently with individuals based on the RNA splicing patterns and synaptic functions regulated by the RBFOX1 gene, which plays a significant role in neurological conditions. These pharmacodynamic interactions are speculative but are based on RBFOX1's involvement in modulating neuronal communications and responses, crucial for the effectiveness of neurological medications.
