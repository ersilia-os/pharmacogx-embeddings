PAPPA2, a gene involved in regulating insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), has no direct, well-characterized pharmacogenetic interactions with most drugs, although it might affect the pharmacodynamics of treatments that modulate growth factors due to its indirect impact on the IGF system. The mentioned drug, salbutamol, a beta-2 agonist for treating asthma, lacks a clear pharmacological link with PAPPA2, with any conjectured connection likely resting on salbutamol's broader impacts on metabolic processes and muscle function, where IGFs are also influential.
