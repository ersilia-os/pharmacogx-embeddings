IDO1 is a key enzyme in pharmacogenetics, especially in cancer treatment because it regulates immune responses by controlling tryptophan catabolism. Drugs like indoximod and epacadostat target IDO1 to prevent it from creating an immunosuppressive environment, enhancing the effectiveness of cancer therapies. However, individual responses to these drugs vary significantly due to genetic variations in the IDO1 gene that affect both tryptophan metabolism and the action of the drugs.
