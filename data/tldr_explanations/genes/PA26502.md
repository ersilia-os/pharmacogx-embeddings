CHST2, through its role in glycosylation, may interact pharmacodynamically with drugs used in autoimmune therapies or cancer treatments aimed at preventing metastasis by influencing leukocyte migration and tumor cell interactions. This gene possibly affects the effectiveness of such drugs, particularly related to leukocyte trafficking and the interaction of tumor cells with the extracellular matrix, through its impact on glycoprotein and glycolipid structures and functions.
