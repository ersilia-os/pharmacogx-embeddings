The effectiveness and safety of Aldesleukin, a recombinant form of IL2 used in treating renal cell carcinoma and metastatic melanoma, can be significantly influenced by genetic variations in the IL2 gene, particularly polymorphisms in its promoter region which affect IL2 production levels and subsequently patient response to the therapy. Additionally, drugs like methotrexate may interact with IL2 pathways, influencing immune responses through pharmacodynamic mechanisms, highlighting the necessity of considering pharmacogenetic factors in optimizing treatment outcomes in immune-related therapies.
