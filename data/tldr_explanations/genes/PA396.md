ABCC9, encoding the sulfonylurea receptor 2 (SUR2) involved in KATP channels, affects the efficacy of sulfonylureas like glibenclamide and glimepiride in stimulating insulin secretion by impacting drug response variability due to genetic variants. These variants may also influence the metabolism or transport of other drugs like montelukast, indicating a broader pharmacogenetic role of ABCC9 in treatments beyond diabetes, including cardiovascular therapies.
