The TTR gene is crucial in the management of TTR-related amyloidosis diseases, interacting significantly with drugs like tafamidis, diflunisal, and patisiran. Tafamidis and diflunisal stabilize the tetrameric structure of the TTR protein to prevent its dissociation into amyloidogenic forms, while patisiran reduces the production of TTR protein through RNA interference, thereby lessening the substrate for amyloid formation, illustrating the importance of both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions in disease treatment.
