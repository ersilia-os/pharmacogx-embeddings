Variants in the PDYN gene, which encodes for prodynorphin, affect the interaction with kappa opioid receptors (KOR) and influence the effectiveness of drugs such as heroin, cocaine, methadone, and buprenorphine by altering dynorphin activity. This modulation impacts addiction susceptibility and the response to treatments for opioid dependence, underscoring PDYN's role in personalized medicine for addiction and pain management.
