Although ITGA9, which is integral to cell adhesion and signaling, is not directly targeted by drugs like citalopram, its interaction with these drugs is primarily through complex pharmacodynamic effects rather than pharmacokinetics. These interactions may influence treatment outcomes in diseases like cancer and fibrosis, and mental health disorders, by affecting cellular behaviors and response pathways involved in these conditions.
