SFRP5, a key regulator in the Wnt signaling pathway related to metabolic regulations and adipogenesis, potentially interacts with antidiabetic medications like metformin and thiazolidinediones due to its role in insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. Additionally, its involvement in inflammatory pathways in adipose tissue may influence responses to anti-inflammatory drugs used in managing obesity-related inflammation, thereby affecting the drugs' pharmacodynamics.
