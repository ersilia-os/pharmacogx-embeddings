Drugs such as EPZ031686 and BAY-6035, which are inhibitors of the SMYD3 methyltransferase, specifically target the pharmacodynamics by hindering the gene's enzymatic activity to suppress tumor growth in cancers like colorectal, hepatocellular carcinoma, and breast cancer. The effectiveness of these inhibitors can be influenced by SMYD3 gene polymorphisms, which affect the enzyme's function or expression, pointing to a significant pharmacogenetic interaction that could impact therapeutic outcomes.
