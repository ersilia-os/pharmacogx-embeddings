The RGS4 gene, which regulates neurotransmitter signaling such as dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate, significantly impacts the efficacy and side effect profiles of antipsychotics like olanzapine, perphenazine, risperidone, quetiapine, and ziprasidone. These drugs, used in treating schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, interact with RGS4 in a pharmacodynamic manner, influencing signal transduction processes rather than the pharmacokinetics of the medications.
