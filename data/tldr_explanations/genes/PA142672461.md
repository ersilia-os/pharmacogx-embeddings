SZRD1, which may have a role in RNA binding, could potentially affect the metabolism or transport of daunorubicin, a chemotherapy drug, thereby altering the drug's efficacy or toxicity. This interaction is presumed to occur through modulation of drug metabolizing enzymes or transporters at the RNA level, although the exact mechanism remains unconfirmed due to insufficient understanding of SZRD1's functions.
