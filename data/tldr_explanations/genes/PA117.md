COMT (Catechol-O-Methyltransferase) influences the effectiveness and side effects of various drugs by metabolizing catecholamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine. Drugs like rasagiline and tolcapone used in Parkinson's disease directly interact with COMT, affecting dopamine levels; meanwhile, other medications such as antipsychotics, ADHD treatments, and opioids may also be affected by COMT activity variations, particularly due to genetic polymorphisms like Val158Met, impacting drug responses and necessity for dosage adjustments.
