Variants in the MYLIP gene, which plays a role in the degradation of the LDL receptor (LDLR), can affect the efficacy of statins like atorvastatin by altering how these drugs enhance LDL cholesterol clearance from the bloodstream. This influence on statin response can lead to variations in the effectiveness and optimal dosing of atorvastatin for managing cholesterol levels, based on individual genetic profiles.
