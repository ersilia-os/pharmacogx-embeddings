Variants in the EGF gene, such as the A61G mutation, impact the pharmacodynamics of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in cancer treatments by affecting EGFR binding and activation efficiency, which influences both the efficacy and toxicity of drugs targeting the EGF-EGFR signaling pathways in conditions like non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This interaction between EGF gene variants and drug action is critical for personalizing therapy to maximize treatment effectiveness and minimize adverse effects in cancers with overactive EGF-EGFR signaling.
