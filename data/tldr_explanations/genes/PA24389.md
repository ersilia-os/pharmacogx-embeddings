Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) supplementation in patients with disorders such as X-linked sideroblastic anemia and ataxia, which involve the ABCB7 gene, may benefit mitochondrial function or enhance the residual activity of pathways dependent on ABCB7. This supplementation does not affect ABCB7 gene expression or protein function directly, but rather helps offset the impacts of its deficiency.
