Beta-blockers are crucial for managing arrhythmic disorders like catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) influenced by mutations in the RYR2 gene, as they reduce heart rate and prevent abnormal rhythms by affecting the excitation-contraction coupling process governed by RYR2-encoded channels. Statins, such as atorvastatin and simvastatin, while commonly used for lipid lowering, do not directly interact with the RYR2 gene but may be relevant in broader cardiovascular treatment regimes involving patients with cardiac conditions.
