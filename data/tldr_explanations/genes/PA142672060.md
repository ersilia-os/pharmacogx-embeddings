CYB5R2 influences the metabolism of certain drugs through its involvement in cytochrome metabolism, affecting pharmacokinetics and potentially altering the efficacy or toxicity of medications. Notably, metoclopramide, isosorbide dinitrate, isosorbide mononitrate, and primaquine might interact with this gene, with potential variations in drug metabolism impacting clinical outcomes.
