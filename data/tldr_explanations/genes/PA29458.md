Variations in the HRH3 gene, which encodes the H3 subtype of histamine receptors, can affect the effectiveness and adverse effect profile of psychoactive medications like risperidone, used in treating schizophrenia and ADHD. This is due to HRH3's role in modulating neurotransmitter dynamics, particularly impacting risperidone's influence on cognitive functions and neuroendocrine processes through histamine signaling.
