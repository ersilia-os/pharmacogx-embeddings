POMT2 (Protein O-Mannosyltransferase 2) does not play a direct role in the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of conventional drugs, as it is mainly associated with disorders like dystroglycanopathies that involve defective glycosylation of muscle and neural proteins. Current research indicates that there are no significant pharmacogenetic interactions between POMT2 and traditional pharmacological treatments, with the focus rather being on investigational gene therapies to correct glycosylation defects related to POMT2.
