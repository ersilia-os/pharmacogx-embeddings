Although direct pharmacogenetic interactions between ERICH3 and specific drugs are not clearly established, the potential interaction could be with serotonin-targeting drugs like escitalopram and citalopram, which are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors used to treat depression and anxiety. This speculative interaction would likely be pharmacodynamic, affecting the body's response to the medication through modulation of neurotransmitter pathways, particularly serotonin, due to ERICH3's presumed role in neuronal activity.
