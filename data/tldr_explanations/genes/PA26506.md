CHST6, the gene responsible for the biosynthesis of keratan sulfate, is involved in corneal integrity but does not directly interact with drugs in a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic manner, as its action is localized and it primarily affects individuals with Macular Corneal Dystrophy (MCD) rather than altering drug activity or metabolism. There are no well-established drug interactions that modify CHST6 activity or expression due to its specific function and localized expression in the cornea.
