UGT2B28 is involved in the glucuronidation process that helps in the elimination of drugs and hormones from the body, influencing the pharmacokinetics of hormone-based therapies used in treating hormone-dependent cancers. The gene's polymorphisms primarily affect drug metabolism rates, leading to variations in treatment outcomes or adverse effects due to differences in drug clearance rates.
