Variations in the gene DTNBP1 can influence the effectiveness and side effect profiles of certain antipsychotics and antidepressants, such as haloperidol, aripiprazole, clozapine, and citalopram, through its role in dopamine pathways and synaptic function. This pharmacodynamic interaction, mainly involving changes in neurotransmitter regulation and synaptic plasticity, also affects drugs like methamphetamine, which impacts dopamine release and reuptake.
