HPRT1 is essential for metabolizing purine analog drugs like mercaptopurine and thioguanine, which are used in leukemia treatment; mutations in HPRT1 can impair this process, affecting drug efficacy and toxicity and potentially necessitating dosage adjustments. While not a purine analog, mycophenolic acid may interact indirectly through competitive pathways or shared metabolic processes, but this connection to HPRT1 is more speculative.
