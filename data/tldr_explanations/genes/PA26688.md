CNTN4, involved in neurodevelopment, does not generally influence drug pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics but may affect the therapeutic response of the antipsychotic drug ziprasidone, particularly in managing symptoms in autism spectrum disorder. The gene's role in neural development and connectivity might alter the drug's efficacy, suggesting the interaction is non-pharmacokinetic and could depend on genetic variability in CNTN4 expression or function.
