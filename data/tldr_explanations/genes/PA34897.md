Drugs such as doxazosin, an alpha-blocker, and amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, could potentially interact with the RYR3 gene by altering calcium flux mediated by the receptor. These pharmacodynamic interactions mainly affect calcium channel function and subsequent cellular responses, potentially influencing neurological functions and other processes relying on intracellular calcium signaling.
