Mutations in the MSH2 gene, associated with the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system, influence cancer treatment efficacy by affecting drug resistance and effectiveness. Specifically, MSH2 mutations can lead to resistance to alkylating agents such as temozolomide and thiopurines (mercaptopurine, thioguanine) due to impaired MMR, while enhancing the effectiveness of checkpoint inhibitors like pembrolizumab in treating tumors with mismatch repair deficiency (MMRD). Conversely, the impact of doxorubicin on MMRD tumors might be influenced by genetic and cellular changes rather than direct interaction with the MMR pathway.
