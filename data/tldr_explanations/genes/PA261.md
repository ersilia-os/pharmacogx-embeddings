The SERPINE1 gene, through its 4G/5G polymorphism, impacts the levels of PAI-1, thereby influencing the effectiveness of drugs such as fluoxetine, warfarin, citalopram, and dexamethasone in the management of cardiovascular disorders and thrombosis. This interaction affects mechanisms like platelet aggregation and anticoagulation, emphasizing the need for genetic profiling in personalized medicine to optimize drug efficacy and tailor treatments for individuals with specific SERPINE1 variants.
