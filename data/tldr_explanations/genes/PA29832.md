IL4R genetic variations can affect the effectiveness of dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting IL4 and IL13 signaling, which is used to treat allergic and autoimmune diseases such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. Additionally, sunitinib, while mainly a cancer therapy interfering with protein kinases, may also modulate the immune system by interacting with IL4R through cytokine receptor modulation, although this interaction is less well-defined.
