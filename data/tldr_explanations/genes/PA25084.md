ATF2's role in regulating transcription and stress response pathways, particularly via the MAPK signaling pathway, suggests its potential indirect pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs like fentanyl, which modulates these pathways. Although ATF2 does not directly interact with opioid pathways, it may influence the pharmacodynamics of fentanyl indirectly by affecting stress or immune responses under conditions of stress or inflammation related to chronic pain.
