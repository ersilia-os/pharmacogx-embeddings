Mutations in the gene ALDH7A1 influence the effectiveness of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) treatment in pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE) by affecting the conversion of pyridoxine into its active form, crucial for neurotransmitter metabolism. While ALDH7A1 is not directly associated with pharmacokinetic interactions with specific drugs, its role in metabolizing biochemicals, including aldehydes, suggests it could indirectly affect the efficacy and toxicity of drugs that produce aldehyde intermediates during their metabolism.
