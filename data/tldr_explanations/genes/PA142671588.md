The gene KLC3, part of the kinesin protein complex, is indirectly involved in the pharmacodynamics of several chemotherapy drugs like doxorubicin, gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, ifosfamide, and methotrexate due to its role in microtubule dynamics and cellular transport mechanisms. Alterations in KLC3 could potentially affect the delivery and efficacy of these drugs, although direct pharmacokinetic interactions remain to be fully explored.
