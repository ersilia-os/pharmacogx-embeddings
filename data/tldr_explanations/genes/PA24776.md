The gene AMPD1, important in muscle energy balance and purine metabolism, significantly interacts with various drugs through its role in converting AMP to IMP. Variations in AMPD1, such as the C34T mutation, potentially alter the metabolism and efficacy of antiviral treatments like ribavirin in hepatitis C, and affect the dynamics and effectiveness of cardiovascular drugs like folic acid, methotrexate, and regadenoson, by influencing nucleotide synthesis, metabolism, and adenosine receptor activation.
