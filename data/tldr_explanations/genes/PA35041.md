Variations in the COL1A1 gene, essential for collagen formation, influence the effectiveness of bisphosphonates, which are used to prevent bone mass loss in conditions like osteogenesis imperfecta and osteoporosis. Additionally, the interaction between the COL1A1 gene and valproic acid, a drug primarily for seizure management, affects bone health, but via pharmacodynamics and systemic effects on bone metabolism rather than a direct pharmacogenetic mechanism.
