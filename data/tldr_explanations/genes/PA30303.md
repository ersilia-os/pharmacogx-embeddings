Venlafaxine, an antidepressant, interacts with the LBP gene—which encodes Lipopolysaccharide Binding Protein involved in the immune response—potentially influencing the drug’s effects on the immune system. This interaction is through neuro-immune pathways rather than by altering the drug's pharmacokinetics, indicating that venlafaxine's interaction with neurotransmitters might change immune system responses via LBP's role in immune modulation.
