The PRORP gene, involved in RNA modification in mitochondrial and plastid ribosomes, has a speculative pharmacogenetic link to drugs like zileuton, an asthma management drug that influences mitochondrial functions by interfering with leukotriene metabolism, a process occurring partially in mitochondria. Though the connection between PRORP and zileuton's mitochondrial effects is hypothetical and lacks solid clinical proof, it is theorized based on PRORP's role in mitochondrial RNA processing and zileuton's impact on mitochondrial pathways.
