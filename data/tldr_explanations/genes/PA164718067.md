CLNK, an adaptor protein in immunoregulatory signaling, potentially interacts with immune-modulating drugs due to its influence on T cells and mast cells. While specific drugs directly interacting with CLNK have not been widely identified, its involvement in cytokine receptor complex assembly and signal transduction suggests that biologic therapies targeting cytokine signaling could have varying efficacy based on genetic variations in CLNK.
