The drug nintedanib, usually employed for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, shows potential for treating diseases like ARVD/C or certain skin conditions, due to its role in diseases involving abnormal tissue development which may interact with the cellular functions of the Desmoplakin (DSP) gene that maintains cell structure through desmosomes. This suggests an inferred pharmacodynamic interaction where treatment efficacy or side effects in disorders characterized by structural disruptions could be influenced by the gene's role in cellular integrity.
