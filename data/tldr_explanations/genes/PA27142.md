The interaction between the drug gemcitabine, used for various cancers, and DAPK1 (Death-associated protein kinase 1), which promotes apoptosis, suggests that the efficacy of gemcitabine may be influenced by DAPK1's function or expression in cancer cells. This pharmacodynamic interaction primarily involves modulation of apoptotic pathways, critical to gemcitabine's mechanism, potentially enabling tailored therapeutic approaches based on DAPK1 activity in tumors.
