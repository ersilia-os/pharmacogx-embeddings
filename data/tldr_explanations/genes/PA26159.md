Oxaliplatin, a chemotherapy drug, interacts with the gene CCNH, which plays a role in cell cycle regulation and DNA damage response. Variations in CCNH expression or function could affect the effectiveness or toxicity of oxaliplatin by altering how cancer cells respond to DNA damage, potentially affecting the drug's efficacy by influencing cell cycle arrest and DNA repair processes.
