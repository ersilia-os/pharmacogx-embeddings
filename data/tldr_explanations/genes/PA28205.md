The gene FOLH1 is central to folate metabolism and its encoded enzyme PSMA is exploited by drugs like Lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan (Pluvicto) to deliver targeted radiotherapy to prostate cancer cells. While drugs such as methotrexate and mercaptopurine, involved in chemotherapy protocols, might also interact with FOLH1, influencing drug efficacy or toxicity due to disruptions in folate metabolism, the precise nature of these interactions remains speculative and more indirect.
