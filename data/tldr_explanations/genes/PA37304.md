Sorafenib, targeting RAF kinase and VEGF receptors, likely interacts with the VEGFC pathways by inhibiting receptor activity, thereby reducing tumor angiogenesis. Methotrexate, an antimetabolite, might indirectly affect VEGFC pathways by targeting rapidly dividing cells and impacting tissues where VEGFC is expressed.
