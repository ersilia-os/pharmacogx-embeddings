Methotrexate, an antifolate drug used in cancer treatment, indirectly interacts with the pathways influenced by BIRC5 (survivin) by targeting rapid cell division, which could be potentiated by combining it with therapies that target survivin to inhibit programmed cell death. Although not directly affecting survivin, the efficacy of methotrexate may be affected by survivin levels, suggesting a potential synergistic effect with survivin-inhibiting drugs to enhance apoptosis and overcome drug resistance in cancers.
