The HAGH gene, crucial in detoxifying methylglyoxal through the glyoxalase system, could impact the metabolism and toxicity of drugs that generate methylglyoxal as a byproduct or affect glutathione levels, although no specific drugs have been documented with direct pharmacogenetic interactions with this gene. Drugs altering oxidative stress or glutathione levels, particularly in diabetic treatments, might have altered effectiveness due to variations in the HAGH gene, affecting drug metabolism and detoxification.
