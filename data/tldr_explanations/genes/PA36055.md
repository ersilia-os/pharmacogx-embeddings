Drugs such as fluorouracil, gemcitabine, leucovorin, and capecitabine, used in cancer treatment, interact with the SPARC gene, which is involved in tumor growth and metastasis. The presence of SPARC affects the efficacy of these drugs, largely through pharmacodynamic interactions that influence cell proliferation and tissue remodeling, rather than through changes in the drugsâ€™ pharmacokinetics.
