Etoposide and paclitaxel, chemotherapeutic agents, do not directly interact pharmacokinetically with MDM2 but affect the MDM2-p53 pathway pharmacodynamically by inducing DNA damage, which disrupts MDM2's degradation of p53 and thus enhances p53's tumor suppressor functions. This interaction is particularly beneficial in cancer therapy for tumors wherein p53 is regulated by overexpressed MDM2, possibly improving treatment outcomes by increasing effective p53 activity.
