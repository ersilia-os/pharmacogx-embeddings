CNTN5, a gene involved in key neurological processes, does not have direct documented drug interactions. However, variations in this gene could influence treatment outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders like autism and intellectual disabilities, thus potentially impacting personalized medication strategies in future based on its role in neurogenesis and synaptic functions.
