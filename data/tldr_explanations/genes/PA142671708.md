No specific drug interactions with the GRAMD1B gene have been documented, but due to its role in lipid metabolism, potential interactions could occur with drugs like statins or those used in managing type 2 diabetes. Variations in the GRAMD1B gene might affect the pharmacokinetics of these drugs, influencing their absorption, metabolism, or excretion.
