Drugs that influence the activity of AMPA receptors, including nootropics and medications for neurodegenerative diseases and epilepsy, may have altered efficacy due to genetic variations in the GRIA1 gene. This gene codes for a subunit of AMPA-type glutamate receptors, which are integral to neurotransmitter signaling in the central nervous system, thereby affecting the pharmacodynamics and possibly the pharmacokinetics of these drugs.
