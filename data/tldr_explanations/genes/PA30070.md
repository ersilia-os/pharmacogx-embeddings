KCNN1 influences neurological conditions by modulating neuronal excitability and is vital in pharmacogenetic interactions, particularly with drugs like apamin, a bee venom peptide that blocks SK channels including those containing KCNN1. Genetic variations in KCNN1 may alter the therapeutic and adverse responses to such drugs, emphasizing the importance of considering genetic makeup in personalized treatment strategies for neurological disorders.
