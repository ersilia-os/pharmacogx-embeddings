ABCG2, a gene encoding an efflux transporter, significantly influences the pharmacokinetics of various drugs by altering their absorption, distribution, and excretion, impacting the effectiveness and required dosages of medications like rosuvastatin, chemotherapy agents (topotecan, methotrexate), tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sunitinib, imatinib), antiretrovirals (tenofovir), and cardiovascular drugs (atorvastatin, apixaban). Variants such as Q141K in the ABCG2 gene can further modify these drug interactions, necessitating adjustments in drug therapies to ensure optimal efficacy and safety.
