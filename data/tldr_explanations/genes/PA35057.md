HLA-C plays a crucial role in drug hypersensitivity reactions, primarily through immune response mechanisms influenced by its polymorphic nature. The presence of the HLA-C*06:02 allele, for example, is strongly associated with hypersensitivity to abacavir, used in HIV treatment, necessitating genetic screening to prevent severe reactions. Other drugs such as carbamazepine, allopurinol, clozapine, and phenytoin also show interactions with various HLA alleles that might contribute to adverse reactions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.
