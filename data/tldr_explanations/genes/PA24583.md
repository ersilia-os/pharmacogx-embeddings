Caffeine interacts directly with the ADORA1 gene by acting as an antagonist to the Adenosine A1 Receptor, leading to increased alertness and variability in sleepiness depending on genetic variants of ADORA1. Aspirin may influence ADORA1 indirectly by affecting adenosine signaling pathways, potentially altering responses mediated by ADORA1, although this connection is not as direct as with caffeine.
