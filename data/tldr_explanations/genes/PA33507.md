The gene POLR2A, crucial for mRNA synthesis, indirectly influences the effectiveness of the anticancer drug gemcitabine, used in treating pancreatic cancer. While POLR2A itself does not directly interact with gemcitabine, its role in maintaining transcription fidelity means that any dysfunction could alter how cells respond to DNA damage induced by the drug, potentially affecting the drug's efficacy.
