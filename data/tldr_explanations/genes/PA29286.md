The HINT1 gene, significant in signal transduction and enzymatic activity within the nervous system, may influence the effectiveness and toxicity of antiviral drugs like sofosbuvir and daclatasvir through its role in viral replication pathways, and potentially affect the pharmacodynamics of nicotine due to its neurological expressions. These interactions suggest the gene's variations could alter therapeutic outcomes and side effects in treatments for neurological disorders and neuropathic pain.
