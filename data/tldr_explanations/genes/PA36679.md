Drugs like doxorubicin, cisplatin, and others are more effective with wild-type TP53 due to its role in mediating apoptosis through p53-dependent pathways, as these drugs induce DNA damage which requires functional p53 to initiate apoptosis and suppress tumor growth. Conversely, mutations in TP53 often lead to resistance against these drugs, as the mutated gene disrupts normal p53-dependent apoptotic signaling, impacting drug efficacy and complicating cancer treatment. Venetoclaxâ€™s effectiveness also varies with TP53 mutation status due to its interaction with apoptotic signaling pathways.
