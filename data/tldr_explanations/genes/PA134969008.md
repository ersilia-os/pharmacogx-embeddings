Although no specific drugs have been proven to interact pharmacogenetically with CHST12, an enzyme involved in sulfating glycosaminoglycans such as chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate, this gene's role in connective tissue modification suggests it could influence the effectiveness of drugs treating joint and skeletal disorders by affecting extracellular matrix properties. Variations in CHST12 might impact how treatments targeting these biochemical pathways perform, but current understanding of these interactions remains theoretical without concrete data.
