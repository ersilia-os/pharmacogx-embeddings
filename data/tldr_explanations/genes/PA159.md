The efficacy and safety of anticoagulant treatments such as Warfarin and DOACs like rivaroxaban are significantly influenced by the F5 gene, especially the Factor V Leiden mutation, which necessitates careful dose adjustments and genetic testing. Drugs like lusutrombopag, avatrombopag, eltrombopag, and tamoxifen also interact with F5 mutations, affecting their efficacy and risk profiles, which underscores the importance of tailored therapy choices and monitoring in affected patients.
