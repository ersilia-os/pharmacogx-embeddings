The SRP19 gene, involved in protein targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum, lacks documented pharmacogenetic interactions affecting the metabolism, efficacy, or safety of antidepressants such as sertraline, paroxetine, fluoxetine, and citalopram. These antidepressants are mainly metabolized by the CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 enzymes, and there is no established evidence that variations in SRP19 influence the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of these drugs.
