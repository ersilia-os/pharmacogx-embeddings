MLH1-deficient tumors exhibit resistance to alkylating agents such as temozolomide, while showing increased sensitivity to platinum-based drugs like cisplatin and carboplatin due to their inability to repair DNA cross-links. Additionally, MLH1 status influences the effectiveness of immunotherapies like pembrolizumab in tumors with microsatellite instability, although its impact on non-alkylating agents like irinotecan is less clearly defined in the literature.
