The ADM gene, encoding for Adrenomedullin which is critical in vasodilation and angiogenesis, potentially interacts with drugs used in cardiovascular diseases such as treatments for hypertension and heart failure, where genetic variations in ADM could influence drug responsiveness. Additionally, in cancer treatment, ADM's role in angiogenesis might make it a target for inhibitors aimed at reducing tumor vascularization, whereas antidepressants like fluoxetine and paroxetine could indirectly impact ADM pathways related to stress responses and vascular functions, albeit their exact pharmacogenetic interactions are yet to be fully clarified.
