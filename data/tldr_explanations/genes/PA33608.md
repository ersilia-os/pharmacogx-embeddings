Individuals with Variegate Porphyria (VP) who have mutations in the PPOX gene are particularly sensitive to drugs like phenytoin, carbamazepine, and barbiturates, which induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. The induction of these enzymes by such drugs increases heme synthesis, leading to the accumulation of toxic porphyrin precursors due to the enzymatic deficit from PPOX mutations, exacerbating VP symptoms like photosensitivity and neurological disturbances.
