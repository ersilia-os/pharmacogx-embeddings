Mutations in the SLC4A1 gene, which affects red blood cell morphology and kidney function, can indirectly impact the pharmacodynamics of beta-blockers like metoprolol and atenolol, used in managing hypertension and cardiac issues. These mutations might influence the efficacy and safety of such drugs by altering blood flow, erythrocyte functionality, and potentially affecting the drug's excretion through its impact on kidney bicarbonate handling.
