GPX7, involved in reducing peroxides to combat oxidative stress, particularly in the liver and kidney, might indirectly influence the metabolism of drugs that undergo oxidation reactions or alter the cellular redox state. Though its direct pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs are not well-documented, any influence it has may affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized in areas like the liver by protecting cells from the oxidative damage caused by drug metabolism.
