RPP30, involved in tRNA maturation, does not directly interact with drugs to alter their pharmacokinetics but could theoretically affect the pharmacodynamics of drugs that impact cellular metabolism and genetic expression. Although some SSRIs like fluoxetine, paroxetine, citalopram, and escitalopram are mentioned, there is no direct evidence linking RPP30 variations to changes in the metabolism or activity of these drugs, suggesting any interactions would be speculative and potentially indirect, affecting pharmacodynamics rather than pharmacokinetics.
