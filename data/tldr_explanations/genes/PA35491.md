STMN1's interaction with anti-cancer drugs like paclitaxel and vincristine involves its role in microtubule dynamics, where its high expression can lead to resistance by destabilizing microtubules against the drugs' stabilizing actions. This gene's expression thus critically influences the pharmacodynamics and effectiveness of these microtubule-targeting medications, potentially causing drug resistance.
