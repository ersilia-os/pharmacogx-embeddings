Gemtuzumab ozogamicin, a drug used in treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML), targets the CD33 antigen on AML cells through a monoclonal antibody linked with a cytotoxic agent, thereby reducing damage to normal cells. The drug's efficacy and patient outcomes are influenced by genetic variations in the CD33 gene, which can alter the drug's pharmacodynamics by affecting the antibody's binding affinity or the antigen's density on the cell surface.
