The SLC27A1 gene, which facilitates the transport of long-chain fatty acids crucial for lipid metabolism, may interact significantly with drugs that target lipid levels, such as fibrates (gemfibrozil and fenofibrate), used to treat conditions like dyslipidemia and NAFLD. Variations in the SLC27A1 gene can potentially alter the effectiveness and metabolic processing of these drugs, affecting therapeutic outcomes due to its role in fatty acid transport and metabolism.
