RBFOX3, a gene involved in regulating neuron-specific alternative splicing, does not have direct pharmacogenetic interactions with any known drugs that affect its function or expression. However, its role in modulating synaptic transmission and neuronal excitation may indirectly influence the efficacy and safety of drugs targeting these processes in the treatment of neurological conditions, although these interactions remain theoretical.
