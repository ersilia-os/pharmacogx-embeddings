The ABCG8 gene influences the effectiveness of ezetimibe, a drug that reduces cholesterol by targeting a sterol transporter formed by ABCG8 and ABCG5, which limits cholesterol absorption in the intestines. Variations in ABCG8 can alter this transporter's activity, impacting ezetimibeâ€™s efficacy, while the effects of these variations on atorvastatin and simvastatin (drugs that inhibit cholesterol synthesis via a different mechanism) are less direct and may operate through altered cholesterol metabolism and feedback mechanisms.
