The interaction between the gene GRIK3 and the antidepressant fluoxetine highlights the importance of pharmacogenetics in personalizing treatments for psychiatric disorders like bipolar disorder and depression. Variants in GRIK3, which encodes a protein in the glutamate receptor family, affect fluoxetine's efficacy by influencing synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission, thereby altering the drug's pharmacodynamic effects on neuronal communication.
