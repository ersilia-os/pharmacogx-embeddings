SLC39A14, involved in transporting divalent metal ions like zinc and manganese, affects drug metabolism and pharmacological responses, including the clearance and toxicity of metals influenced by drugs. The interaction between nortriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, and SLC39A14 may influence metal ion homeostasis by modulating the function or expression of this gene, potentially affecting manganese pathways, which could be neuroprotective or neurotoxic depending on the patient's genetic makeup.
