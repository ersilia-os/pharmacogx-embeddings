Drugs such as teriparatide and dobutamine may have altered effectiveness in patients with mutations in the GNAS gene, which is crucial for cAMP signaling pathways. In conditions like pseudohypoparathyroidism and McCune-Albright syndrome, these mutations affect the drug's pharmacodynamics, impacting how the drug works in the body due to the geneâ€™s direct role in signaling rather than its metabolism.
