The POMC gene, through its product beta-endorphin, influences the effectiveness of drugs like naltrexone, which is used for treating alcohol and opioid dependence. Variations in POMC expression impact an individual's pain sensitivity and response to opioids, thereby affecting how naltrexone works by interacting with opioid receptors and altering pain suppression and reward mechanisms facilitated by beta-endorphin.
