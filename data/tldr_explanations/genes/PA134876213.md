TOLLIP, a gene involved in immune regulation, may interact pharmacogenetically with acetylcysteine, a drug with mucolytic and anti-inflammatory effects. The interaction, possibly via pharmacodynamic mechanisms, could be influenced by variations in the TOLLIP gene, thus potentially affecting the drugâ€™s effectiveness in treating conditions like chronic respiratory diseases.
