Variations in the TAOK3 gene can affect the effectiveness and side effects of kinase inhibitors used in cancer therapy due to its role in crucial signaling pathways like JNK and p38/MAPK. In terms of morphine, a pain management opioid, TAOK3 does not alter its pharmacokinetics but may influence its pharmacodynamics, potentially affecting morphineâ€™s effectiveness in pain management and susceptibility to opioid-induced hyperalgesia via modulation of pain pathways.
