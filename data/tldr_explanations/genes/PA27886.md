Variations in the ESR2 gene, which encodes the estrogen receptor beta (ERÎ²), significantly impact the therapeutic effectiveness and safety of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as tamoxifen and raloxifene, particularly in treating breast cancer and preventing osteoporosis. Additionally, ESR2 variants may alter the response to other anticancer agents like toremifene, fulvestrant, and various drugs including everolimus, abemaciclib, and letrozole, which do not primarily target estrogen pathways but are influenced by estrogen signaling, affecting both drug efficacy and toxicity.
