NQO2, which is involved in metabolizing quinone-containing drugs like cytarabine, idarubicin, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide, influences their toxicity and therapeutic utility through complex pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions. Inhibitors like imatinib and resveratrol affect NQO2 activity, potentially enhancing or altering the therapeutic effects of these drugs, especially in cancer therapy, by impacting their metabolism and effectiveness.
