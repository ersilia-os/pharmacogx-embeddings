SPRY2, which affects receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways, plays a significant role in the pharmacodynamics of cancer treatments by influencing the efficacy of drugs like gefitinib and erlotinib, EGFR inhibitors used in non-small cell lung cancer, depending on its expression and function within tumors. Additionally, SPRY2 may also impact the action of capecitabine, a prodrug converting to 5-FU, by modulating the cellular pathways it regulates, affecting the drug's activity at the cellular level without altering its pharmacokinetics.
