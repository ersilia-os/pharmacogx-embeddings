C20orf194, or MRGBP, indirectly influences pharmacogenetics by contributing to chromatin remodeling, which can affect gene expression critical for drug metabolism, including that of ribavirin used in treating HCV. This gene likely influences the pharmacodynamics of ribavirin by modulating drug effects through transcriptional regulation, although direct evidence linking these interactions is currently speculative.
