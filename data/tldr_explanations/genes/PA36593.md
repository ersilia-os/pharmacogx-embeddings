Variations in the TNFAIP3 gene, which affects the function of the A20 enzyme regulating inflammation and immune responses, may alter the efficacy of methotrexate, a common treatment for inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. This alteration in drug response could be due to TNFAIP3's influence on NF-kappaB activity modulation, impacting how the immune system responds to the medication rather than affecting the drug's metabolism.
