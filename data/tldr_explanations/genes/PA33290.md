The gene PIGB is involved in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which are critical for anchoring proteins to cell membranes and influencing cell adhesion and immune responses. Although there are no direct pharmacogenetic interactions established between PIGB and drugs, the role of GPI anchors suggests a potential indirect influence on the efficacy and toxicity of drugs like fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide, which are used in cancer treatment and depend on effective immune responses and cell adhesion. These indirect effects could vary with individual GPI anchor deficiencies related to PIGB, potentially affecting drug effectiveness and side effects.
