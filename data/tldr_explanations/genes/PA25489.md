Drugs such as muscle relaxants and anticholinergics, used to treat conditions involving muscle contractility and neuronal activity like dystonia, may indirectly interact with the ANO3 gene, which encodes the anoctamin 3 protein involved in controlling chloride ion flux in muscle and neuronal cells. Although ANO3 is not yet a direct target of pharmacogenetic interactions, its involvement in physiological functions related to neurological pathways suggests these drugs could hypothetically influence its activity.
