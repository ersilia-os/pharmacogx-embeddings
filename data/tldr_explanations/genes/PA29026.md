GSTM4 is crucial in detoxifying chemotherapeutic agents and anti-inflammatory drugs by conjugating glutathione to enhance solubility and promote excretion, which impacts drug effectiveness and toxicity. This gene may interact with drugs like cisplatin and busulfan through this pathway, and variations in GSTM4 can influence drug response and the profile of adverse effects by altering the efficiency of detoxification.
