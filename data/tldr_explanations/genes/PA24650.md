CRYBG2, a protein from the beta/gamma-crystallin superfamily, currently shows no established pharmacogenetic interactions affecting drug responses or metabolism, with no specific drugs identified that interact with this gene. The role of CRYBG2 in drug-drug or gene-drug interactions remains unexplored, necessitating further primary research to determine its potential effects on drug efficiency and outcomes.
