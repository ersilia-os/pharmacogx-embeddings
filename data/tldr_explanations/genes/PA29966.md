The ITIH3 gene, involved in stabilizing the extracellular matrix and modulating inflammation, potentially interacts with clozapine— an antipsychotic indicated for treatment-resistant schizophrenia—through mechanisms tied to its effects on immune system modulation. This interaction is likely pharmacodynamic, influencing how clozapine affects inflammation-related processes, rather than affecting the drug's pharmacokinetics.
