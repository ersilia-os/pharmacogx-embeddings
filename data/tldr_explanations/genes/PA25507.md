Although PARP11 is less researched than PARP1 or PARP2, its involvement with DNA repair suggests it may hypothetically influence the effectiveness of PARP inhibitors like Olaparib and Rucaparib in cancer therapies by affecting how these drugs disrupt DNA repair in cancer cells. There is a theoretical possibility that PARP11 could interfere with these drugs' mechanism of enhancing DNA damage in tumor cells, albeit actual evidence of such pharmacogenetic interactions is still absent.
