Currently, no specific pharmacogenetic interactions are identified between THSD7B and any drugs. The gene's inherent roles in cell adhesion and signaling could hypothetically influence interactions with drugs affecting processes like angiogenesis, but these potential connections remain speculative without established evidence.
