MDGA2, significant in neural development and synapse regulation, potentially affects how drugs like paroxetine, fluvoxamine, and milnacipran—which are used for depression and anxiety—work in the brain by impacting neuroplasticity. While the specific interactions of MDGA2 with these drugs are not yet fully confirmed through clinical studies, variations in the MDGA2 gene might influence the treatments' effectiveness or neurobehavioral results.
