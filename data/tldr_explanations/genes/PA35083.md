HLA-G's potential pharmacodynamic interactions with drugs like fluorouracil, irinotecan, methotrexate, and capecitabine, primarily used in chemotherapy, relate to its role in modulating immune responses which could influence the immune system's ability to recognize and destroy tumor cells. These interactions likely result from HLA-G enhancing immune evasion capabilities in cancer cells, thereby potentially modifying the therapeutic efficacy of the mentioned drugs.
