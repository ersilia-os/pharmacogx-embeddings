CASP7, involved in the execution phase of apoptosis, has indirect pharmacogenetic interactions with chemotherapeutic drugs like docetaxel, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, and paclitaxel, which disrupt mitotic functions and induce apoptosis in cancer treatment. Genetic variations in the CASP7 gene may influence the effectiveness and toxicity profile of these treatments by altering how cells respond to induced apoptosis, impacting the overall efficacy of the drugs through pharmacodynamic interactions.
