Drugs that affect glutamatergic signaling, like antiepileptics, medications for intellectual disabilities, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease (such as memantine), may have altered effectiveness or side effects due to their interaction with the CACNG3 gene, which modulates AMPA receptor function. This interaction could also impact the performance of nootropic drugs that enhance cognitive functions by modulating synaptic strength.
