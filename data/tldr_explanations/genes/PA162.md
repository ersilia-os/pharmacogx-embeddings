The pharmacogenetic profile of F13A1 gene affects both the effectiveness and safety of Factor XIII concentrates used in treating Factor XIII deficiency by determining the biological availability and action of these treatments. While drugs like clopidogrel and aspirin, which interfere with platelet function and clot formation, do not directly interact pharmacokinetically with F13A1, their use in patients with clotting disorders associated with F13A1 mutations can affect the hemostatic balance due to F13A1's central role in the clotting cascade.
