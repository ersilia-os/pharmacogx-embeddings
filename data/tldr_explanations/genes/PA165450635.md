PRSS53, a gene involved in hair shape and structure, does not have direct pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs but could potentially influence treatment outcomes with drugs like amiodarone, clopidogrel, aspirin, simvastatin, metformin, tacrolimus, capecitabine, and warfarin. These interactions would be through non-pharmacokinetic means, such as affecting drug efficacy or hair characteristics indirectly via systemic effects or impacts on protein pathways, rather than altering drug metabolism.
