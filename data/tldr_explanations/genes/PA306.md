Variations in the SCNN1B gene, which encodes for the beta-subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), significantly influence the pharmacodynamic response to drugs like amiloride and triamterene that inhibit ENaC. These diuretics are particularly effective in individuals with conditions such as Liddle syndrome, characterized by mutations leading to ENaC hyperactivity, due to their impact on sodium reabsorption in the kidney.
