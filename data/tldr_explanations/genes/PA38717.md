CYP4F12, a cytochrome P450 enzyme, influences the metabolism of drugs that interact with lipid metabolism pathways, including NSAIDs, by affecting processes like hydroxylation of fatty acids. Variants in CYP4F12 could alter the pharmacokinetics of these drugs, potentially impacting their efficacy and safety.
