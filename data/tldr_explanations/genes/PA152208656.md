The FTO gene, which influences energy balance and body mass, does not directly affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs but impacts their pharmacodynamics. Drugs like ribavirin, azathioprine, atenolol, risperidone, and mercaptopurine interact with the metabolic pathways modulated by FTO gene variants, potentially affecting drug metabolism, efficacy, and the profile of side effects observed in patients with different FTO genotypes.
