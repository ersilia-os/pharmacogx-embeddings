Variations in the HNMT gene, such as the Thr105Ile polymorphism, play a crucial role in the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of certain medications by influencing the rate of histamine metabolism. Drugs like diphenhydramine, which acts as an HNMT inhibitor, can have altered effectiveness due to these variations, potentially impacting treatment outcomes for conditions like allergies and asthma.
