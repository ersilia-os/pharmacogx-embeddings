While BSCL2 plays a vital role in lipid metabolism and is associated with severe metabolic disorders, there are no specific pharmacogenetic interactions identified directly with BSCL2. Management of conditions related to BSCL2 mutations primarily entails the use of insulin and metformin to treat common symptoms such as diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia, rather than targeting the gene's specific mechanisms or drug interactions.
