Atorvastatin and ACE inhibitors like lisinopril and enalapril interact pharmacogenetically with the BDKRB2 gene, impacting the metabolism, circulation, and effects of bradykinin, consequently influencing inflammatory and cardiovascular responses. Additionally, the antidiabetic medication glyburide may exhibit non-pharmacokinetic interactions with BDKRB2 variants, affecting vascular tone and endothelial function through potentially shared pathways.
