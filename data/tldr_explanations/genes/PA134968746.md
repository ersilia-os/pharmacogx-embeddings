Variants in the NPAS3 gene may influence the pharmacodynamic response to risperidone, a drug used in treating schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, affecting critical neural pathways like dopaminergic and serotonergic signaling that the medication targets. This gene-drug interaction can potentially modify the drug's efficacy and side effects, highlighting the importance of considering genetic makeup in treatment decisions.
