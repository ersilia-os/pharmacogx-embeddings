TUT7's involvement in microRNA biogenesis could potentially affect the efficacy of ribavirin, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug, since TUT7 modulates the stability and function of microRNAs that could interact with the drug's action on viral and cellular RNA pathways. This interaction between TUT7 gene variations and ribavirin's pharmacodynamics is speculative and requires further investigation.
