The LTB gene, which affects inflammatory pathways, may indirectly influence the response to immune-modulating drugs like abacavir, used in HIV treatment. Although direct pharmacogenetic interactions between LTB and abacavir are not confirmed, LTB-associated variations could potentially affect abacavir's pharmacodynamics, particularly regarding the drug's immune-mediated hypersensitivity reactions.
