OR52E2, an olfactory receptor gene involved in the sense of smell, has no documented pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs, as it primarily functions within the olfactory system and is not associated with drug metabolism, pharmacodynamics, or pharmacokinetics. This receptor is mainly expressed in the olfactory epithelium and lacks relevance to systemic therapeutic drug targets or disease modification.
