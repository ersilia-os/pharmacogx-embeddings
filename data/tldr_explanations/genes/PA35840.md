Variants in the SLCO2A1 gene, which codes for a prostaglandin transporter, significantly impact the pharmacokinetics of drugs such as misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 analog, and celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor. These genetic variations can alter the effectiveness and safety of these drugs by affecting their distribution, metabolism, and excretion, ultimately influencing their levels, activity, and duration of action in the body.
