Paclitaxel, a drug used primarily in cancer therapy to stabilize microtubules by enhancing beta-tubulin polymerization, may potentially influence neuronal function in conditions where the MAPT gene is dysregulated, such as in neurodegenerative disorders. This hypothetical interaction between paclitaxel's mechanism of action on microtubules and the disturbances caused by pathological tau protein aggregations (associated with MAPT mutations) suggests an area for exploration in how microtubule-stabilizing drugs might affect neurodegenerative disease pathways.
