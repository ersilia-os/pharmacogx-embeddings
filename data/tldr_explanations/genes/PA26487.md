Variations in the CHRNA1 gene, which encodes the alpha 1 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, affect the function of receptors targeted by muscle relaxants such as succinylcholine and atracurium used in anesthesia. These genetic variations can lead to altered drug effectiveness and safety, necessitating dosage adjustments to avoid prolonged neuromuscular blockade and other complications.
