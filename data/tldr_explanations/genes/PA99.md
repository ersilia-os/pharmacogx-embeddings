Chemotherapeutic agents indirectly target CDK1, a key gene regulating the cell cycle, by using CDK inhibitors that aim to disrupt cancer cell growth and promote cell death by interfering with cell cycle progression. The effectiveness of these drugs can vary based on gene-specific variations or expression levels in CDK1, affecting how well a cancer responds to treatment.
