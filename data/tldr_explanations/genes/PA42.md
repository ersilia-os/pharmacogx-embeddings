Variants in the AGT gene, which is involved in regulating blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, affect the efficacy of several blood pressure medications, including ACE inhibitors like lisinopril and quinapril, angiotensin II receptor blockers such as irbesartan and losartan, diuretics like hydrochlorothiazide, and other antihypertensives like amlodipine and benazepril. These pharmacogenetic interactions can alter the therapeutic outcomes and risk of adverse effects depending on individual AGT genotypes.
