NR1I2, or pregnane X receptor (PXR), regulates genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes and transport systems like CYP3A4 and MDR1, influencing the pharmacokinetics of various drugs. Activators of NR1I2 such as rifampin and carbamazepine can increase the metabolism and decrease the efficacy of drugs like sirolimus and rosuvastatin by upregulating CYP3A4, while inhibitors can slow metabolism, increasing toxicity risk.
