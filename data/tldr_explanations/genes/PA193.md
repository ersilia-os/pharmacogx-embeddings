Variants in the HTR2A gene, which encodes the 5-HT2A serotonergic receptor, influence the efficacy and side effect profiles of antipsychotics such as clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole, as well as antidepressants including sertraline, paroxetine, and fluoxetine by affecting receptor binding and function. Additionally, HTR2A is implicated in the pharmacodynamic properties of non-psychiatric medications like sumatriptan, nicotine, propofol, and efavirenz, affecting diverse physiological responses ranging from pain modulation to addiction pathways and sedative effects.
