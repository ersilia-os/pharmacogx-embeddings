GGCX plays a key role in the interaction with anticoagulant medications such as warfarin and acenocoumarol, which inhibit vitamin K recycling, essential for the activation of clotting factors. Variations in GGCX can affect enzyme activity, necessitating dose adjustments to achieve therapeutic efficacy, while amiodarone may also impact GGCX activity and vitamin K metabolism, indicating a complex pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction that varies with genetic differences.
