CDH13 significantly influences the effectiveness of cardiovascular drugs like clopidogrel and aspirin by modulating vascular health and platelet aggregation, as well as the efficacy of neuropsychiatric medications such as amphetamine, through its effects on neural connectivity and synaptic signaling. The gene's variations primarily impact pharmacodynamics—how drugs work and are effective—rather than pharmacokinetics—how drugs are metabolized and cleared from the body.
