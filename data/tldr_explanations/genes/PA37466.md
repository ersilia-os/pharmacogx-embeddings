The gene ZMPSTE24, which is involved in processing prelamin A, does not directly interact with drugs, but its mutations are treated pharmacogenetically with lonafarnib, a farnesyltransferase inhibitor. Lonafarnib works by inhibiting the farnesylation of prelamin A, thereby preventing the accumulation of farnesylated prelamin A caused by disrupted ZMPSTE24 activity, and potentially reducing the severity of symptoms in disorders like Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome.
