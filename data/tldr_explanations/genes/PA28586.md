GATA3, though not interacting directly with drugs through traditional routes like metabolism or transport, plays a crucial role in altering the efficacy and toxicity of various drugs used in cancer and immunomodulatory therapies by influencing immune responses and cellular differentiation. This impact is particularly significant in drugs like doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, dexamethasone, and a range of broad-spectrum chemotherapeutic agents, as GATA3's function in immune and cancer pathways, especially in luminal subtype breast cancers, can modify how these drugs affect the body.
