Variants in the IFNGR1 gene can affect the efficacy and safety of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) therapy used in treating diseases like chronic granulomatous disease and cancers. These genetic variations alter receptor function, impacting the response to IFN-γ and leading to different therapeutic outcomes and potential adverse effects due to the impaired or altered immune activation typically facilitated by the IFN-γ through the Jak-STAT signaling pathway.
