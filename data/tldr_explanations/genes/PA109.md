In cystic fibrosis treatments, the interaction of drugs with specific CFTR gene mutations determines their efficacy. Ivacaftor targets gating mutations like G551D to enhance chloride transport, while Lumacaftor and Tezacaftor address the F508del mutation by improving CFTR protein folding and trafficking. Cavosonstat reduces inflammation related to CFTR dysfunction, and Ataluren targets nonsense mutations by enabling ribosomal read-through of premature stop codons, illustrating the need for mutation-specific therapies based on personalized genetic assessments.
