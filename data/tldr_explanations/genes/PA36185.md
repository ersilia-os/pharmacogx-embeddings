Variations in the STAT4 gene, which plays a crucial role in cytokine signaling and immune response, significantly influence the effectiveness of interferon-α treatment in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). These genetic differences affect the drug's pharmacodynamics by altering how well interferon-α activates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, modifying the drug's immunomodulatory effects and impacting both efficacy and safety of the treatment.
