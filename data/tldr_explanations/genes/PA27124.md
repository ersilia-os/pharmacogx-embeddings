CYP7B1, primarily involved in the metabolism of endogenous substances such as cholesterol and steroids, plays a pharmacogenetic role in converting dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) to 7Î±-hydroxy-DHEA. While not directly linked to drug metabolism, alterations in CYP7B1 activity could influence treatments that involve steroid levels, potentially affecting hormonal therapies or treatments for conditions like hereditary spastic paraplegia type 5 (SPG5), though this interaction is currently speculative without solid research evidence.
