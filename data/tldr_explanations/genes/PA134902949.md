Variants of the ATG16L1 gene, involved in the autophagy process, significantly influence the efficacy and adverse reaction profiles of anti-TNF drugs such as infliximab and adalimumab, used for treating autoimmune diseases like Crohn's disease. Understanding these pharmacogenetic interactions, where mutations in ATG16L1 result in a reduced response to these medications, aids clinicians in optimizing personalized treatment regimens by considering the pharmacodynamics of how these drugs interact with the immune system and inflammation pathways.
