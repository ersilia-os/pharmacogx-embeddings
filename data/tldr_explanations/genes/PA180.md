GRK5, a gene coding for a key enzyme in receptor desensitization, influences the efficacy of cardiovascular and neurological drugs, primarily through pharmacodynamic mechanisms. For example, the GRK5-Leu41 polymorphism can enhance the effects of beta-blockers like atenolol, potentially improving management of heart failure and hypertension, and genetic variations in GRK5 may also affect interactions with drugs such as methadone, verapamil, trandolapril, citalopram, and escitalopram, due to its role in specific neurotransmitter pathways.
