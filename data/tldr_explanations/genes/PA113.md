Variants in the CHRNA3 gene, which encodes the alpha-3 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, can affect the metabolism of nicotine and its derivative cotinine, thereby influencing the efficacy and side effects of nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) such as patches and gums used for smoking cessation. Additionally, these gene variations might impact responses to cocaine through pharmacodynamic effects, altering receptor function or expression within cholinergic neurotransmission pathways, though this interaction does not involve direct pharmacokinetic changes like with nicotine and cotinine.
