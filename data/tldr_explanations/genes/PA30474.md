The LTA gene, involved in inflammation and immune response, influences the efficacy and safety of several drugs including methotrexate, corticosteroids, TNF inhibitors, NSAIDs like aspirin, and other medications such as carbamazepine, rosiglitazone, abacavir, and ursodeoxycholic acid through pharmacodynamic mechanisms. This gene's variants affect how these drugs modulate immune response and inflammation, impacting their therapeutic outcomes and potential side effects.
