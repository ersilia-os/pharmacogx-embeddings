The ICA1 gene potentially influences the pharmacokinetics of tramadol and o-desmethyltramadol, primarily through its role in cellular exocytosis mechanisms that may overlap with drug transport processes. While the exact pathways of these interactions are not well-documented, understanding ICA1â€™s impact could help explain the varied individual responses to tramadol, underscoring the importance of genetic factors in personalized medicine approaches.
