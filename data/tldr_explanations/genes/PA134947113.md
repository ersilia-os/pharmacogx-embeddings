RUSC1, known for its role in neural development, has a notable pharmacodynamic interaction with atorvastatin, a drug primarily used for lowering cholesterol. This interaction likely influences neural pathways or cells in the brain, potentially affecting neuronal growth and synaptic plasticity, which suggests an off-target effect of atorvastatin where RUSC1 is active.
