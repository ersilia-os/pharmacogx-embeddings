CYP20A1, an "orphan" enzyme from the cytochrome P450 family, currently has no established drug interactions in pharmacogenetics, with its functional roles and substrates in human metabolism still largely undefined. Despite typical P450 enzymes influencing drug metabolism through oxidation, no pharmacokinetic interactions involving CYP20A1 have been identified due to its low tissue expression and unknown involvement in drug metabolism.
