MAT1A encodes for Methionine Adenosyltransferase 1A, which is crucial in metabolizing drugs that undergo extensive hepatic processing, and plays a role in potential hepatotoxicity due to its function in liver metabolism. Variants in the MAT1A gene can affect individualsâ€™ drug metabolism efficiency, leading to potentially necessary dosage adjustments to avoid toxicity or ineffectiveness, especially for drugs heavily reliant on liver metabolism.
