The enzyme thymidine phosphorylase, encoded by the TYMP gene, plays a crucial role in the conversion of chemotherapeutic agents like 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and its prodrug capecitabine into active metabolites that inhibit DNA synthesis in cancer treatment. Higher levels of TYMP expression enhance the efficacy of these drugs by promoting faster conversion to their active forms but can also increase toxicity due to elevated levels of active metabolites.
