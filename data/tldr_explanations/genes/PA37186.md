UGT2B10, a key enzyme in the glucuronidation pathway, influences the metabolism, clearance, and effects of drugs such as nicotine, cotinine, clozapine, and possibly olanzapine. Variants in the UGT2B10 gene affect the efficacy and toxicity of these substances by altering their pharmacokinetics, which necessitates consideration for dosage adjustments and careful monitoring in clinical settings based on an individual's genetic makeup.
