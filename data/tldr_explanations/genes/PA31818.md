Entrectinib and larotrectinib sulfate, as inhibitors of TrkB among other neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptors, interact with NTRK2 to block signaling pathways essential for tumor growth and neural function, making them relevant in treating NTRK-associated tumors. Methadone and clozapine, although used primarily for pain and psychosis respectively, also affect NTRK2 signaling; methadone might influence TrkB receptor activities, while clozapine could enhance BDNF levels, thereby impacting pathways crucial in therapies for conditions like schizophrenia.
