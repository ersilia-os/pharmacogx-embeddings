Variations in the TGFB1 gene can affect the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs such as irinotecan, which is used to treat metastatic colorectal cancer, by altering TGF-beta signaling pathways involved in cancer cell survival and proliferation. Additionally, drugs like aspirin, which impact inflammatory or fibrotic pathways, might indirectly influence diseases via interactions with the TGF-beta pathway, albeit through pharmacodynamic rather than pharmacokinetic mechanisms, due to the gene's critical role in inflammation and tissue remodeling.
