Hydrochlorothiazide and candesartan, drugs used for managing hypertension, may interact with the metabolic and neuroendocrine pathways influenced by the GPR83 gene, despite not being directly linked to it through pharmacokinetic interactions. Variations in the GPR83 gene could potentially affect the pharmacodynamics of these drugs, subtly influencing their effects on energy balance and inflammatory responses.
