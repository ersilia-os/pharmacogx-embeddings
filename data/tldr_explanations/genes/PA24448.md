Variations in the ACP5 gene, which encodes for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase involved in bone resorption, can affect individual responses to dexamethasone, a drug that impacts bone health by altering bone formation and resorption rates. As such, ACP5 polymorphisms might modify the efficacy or risk of adverse effects of dexamethasone, crucial for managing diseases that affect bone density and turnover.
