The gene DIAPH3, which is involved in actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, has no well-documented pharmacogenetic interactions with specific drugs such as hydrochlorothiazide. While DIAPH3 primarily influences cell shape and movement rather than drug metabolism, its potential effects on drug action, such as altering cellular pathways that affect drug response or distribution, remain speculative and unproven.
