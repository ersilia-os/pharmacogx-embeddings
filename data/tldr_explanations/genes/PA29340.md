The gene HMMR impacts the efficacy of chemotherapy drugs such as fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide in cancers like breast, ovarian, and prostate through its role in cell motility and adhesion. This influence manifests as variations in drug effectiveness, likely due to HMMR'S regulation of cytoskeletal functions and apoptosis pathways, where elevated HMMR expression could lead to increased resistance to treatments that promote cell death.
