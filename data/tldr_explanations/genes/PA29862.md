IMPDH1 is crucial in purine nucleotide synthesis and interacts significantly with various medications, affecting their effectiveness and safety. Mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid, and ribavirin inhibit IMPDH1 to suppress T-lymphocyte growth and enhance antiviral effects, respectively, while methotrexate, azathioprine, and mercaptopurine disrupt the nucleotide synthesis pathway, impacting IMPDH1 indirectly. Variations in IMPDH1 expression or mutations impact the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of these drugs, leading to varied therapeutic outcomes and side effects.
