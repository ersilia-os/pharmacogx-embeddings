ZNF165, or Zinc Finger Protein 165, has not been directly implicated in pharmacogenetic interactions with any contemporary pharmaceuticals and does not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of therapeutic substances. Although it might have potential indirect effects on drug efficacy or toxicity in the future, particularly in therapies related to reproductive health or cancer, there is currently no evidence linking it to specific drug interactions.
