The CD14 gene, involved in the immune response to bacterial infections, indirectly interacts with fluticasone propionate, a corticosteroid used for reducing inflammation in asthma and other conditions. This interaction affects the pharmacodynamics—specifically, the inflammatory pathways mediated by CD14—rather than altering the drug’s pharmacokinetic profile, thereby potentially affecting its effectiveness in treating inflammation.
