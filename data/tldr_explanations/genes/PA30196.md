KRAS mutations significantly impact the efficacy of certain cancer drugs, particularly making EGFR inhibitors like cetuximab and panitumumab ineffective in colorectal cancers by enabling continuous downstream signaling even with EGFR blocked. Additionally, drugs such as sotorasib, which directly target mutated KRAS, and others that engage the RAS/MAPK pathway, show variable effectiveness depending on KRAS mutation status, altering cancer treatment outcomes due to the gene's central role in cell growth and survival mechanisms.
