The LRRC15 gene, known for its role in connective tissue structure and signaling, notably influences the tumor microenvironment and cancer progression but does not exhibit direct pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs. However, drugs like hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol, and atenolol, though unrelated in their primary pathways to LRRC15, might indirectly affect cancer therapy by altering blood pressure and cardiac output, thus impacting tumor blood supply and potentially the effectiveness of treatments in areas where LRRC15 is active.
