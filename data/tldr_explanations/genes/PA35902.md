The pharmacogenetic interactions of the SLC5A2 gene, which codes for the sodium/glucose cotransporter 2, are crucial in the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors like dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, and empagliflozin, used in managing type 2 diabetes. Variations in the SLC5A2 gene can alter the drug's effectiveness by affecting the transporter's interaction with these inhibitors, thereby influencing their role in preventing glucose reabsorption in the kidneys and enhancing glucose excretion in urine.
