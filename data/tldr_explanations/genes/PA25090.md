The drugs daunorubicin, vincristine, asparaginase, hydrocortisone, methotrexate, cytarabine, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide, used in chemotherapy, may indirectly influence ATF5 activity through their effects on cellular stress pathways and cell survival processes. For example, daunorubicin and cyclophosphamide cause DNA damage that may activate ATF5, while methotrexate and cytarabine induce metabolic stress and corticosteroids like hydrocortisone and prednisone may affect ATF5 expression by modifying transcriptional regulation under stress conditions.
