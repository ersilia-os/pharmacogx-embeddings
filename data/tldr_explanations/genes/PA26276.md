The pharmacogenetic interactions between CDCA3 and various drugs including hydrochlorothiazide, sildenafil, sibutramine, and others are not clearly defined, primarily because CDCA3's role focuses on cell cycle regulation relevant to cancer biology, rather than direct interactions with these drugs. The relationship between CDCA3 and these drugs might be indirect, possibly influencing drug resistance mechanisms in cancer treatment, rather than direct pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions.
