Variations in the NRP2 gene, which encodes neuropilin 2 involved in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis, may affect the pharmacokinetics of daunorubicin, a chemotherapeutic used in leukemia. These variations could influence how daunorubicin is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, or excreted, potentially altering the drug's efficacy and toxicity in cancer treatment.
