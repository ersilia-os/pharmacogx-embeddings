Drugs that target the extracellular matrix or signaling pathways like PI3K-Akt, which are involved in hyaluronan (HA) metabolism, may have different levels of effectiveness based on the expression of HAS3, a gene involved in HA synthesis. This interaction is especially significant in oncology, where altering HA synthesis can impact tumor growth and the response to therapy, suggesting that HAS3 primarily influences the pharmacodynamics rather than pharmacokinetics of such treatments.
