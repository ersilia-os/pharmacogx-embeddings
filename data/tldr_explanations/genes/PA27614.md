Genetic variations in the EDN1 gene, which plays a crucial role in vasoconstriction and blood pressure regulation, can affect the efficacy and safety of cardiovascular drugs such as bosentan, ambrisentan, irbesartan, and atenolol. These drugs interact with endothelin pathways involved in vascular resistance and blood pressure control, and variations in EDN1 may influence the effectiveness of these treatments, impacting patient-specific therapeutic outcomes.
