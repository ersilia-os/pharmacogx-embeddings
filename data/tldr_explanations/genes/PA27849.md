Polymorphisms in the ERCC3 gene, which plays a crucial role in the nucleotide excision repair pathway, can affect the efficacy and toxicity of cisplatin, a chemotherapy drug. This interaction occurs because different ERCC3 variants may vary in their capacity to repair DNA damage caused by cisplatin, impacting treatment effectiveness and side effects such as nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity in cancer patients.
