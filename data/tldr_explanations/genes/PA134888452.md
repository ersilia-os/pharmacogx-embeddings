Research indicates that genetic variations in the SV2C gene, which modulates dopamine neurotransmission, can alter the pharmacodynamics of antipsychotic drugs such as quetiapine and olanzapine, potentially impacting their effectiveness in treating disorders like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. These drugs interact with dopamine pathways influenced by SV2C, suggesting that variations in this gene may affect individual responses to these medications in terms of therapeutic outcomes.
