ABCC4 gene variants influence the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of various drugs by modulating their efflux from cells, which impacts drug concentrations in the body. This gene affects a wide range of drugs including cancer treatments (doxorubicin, methotrexate), antiretrovirals (zidovudine, tenofovir), and medications used in cardiovascular diseases and immune disorders (clopidogrel, azathioprine), potentially leading to variable therapy outcomes and drug resistance.
