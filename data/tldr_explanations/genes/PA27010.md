Though specific drugs have not yet been directly linked to interactions with the CTNNA3 gene, which is essential for cellular adhesion and implicated in neurological diseases like Alzheimer's and autism, it is theorized that drugs affecting cell adhesion or targeting neurodegenerative pathways might be influenced by genetic variations in CTNNA3. Such interactions could potentially affect the efficacy of treatments for neurological disorders and patient responses to these treatments.
