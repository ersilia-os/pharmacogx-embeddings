Variations in the GSR gene, which is important for reducing oxidative stress by metabolizing oxidized glutathione, can impact the effectiveness and side effects of platinum-based chemotherapy drugs like cisplatin and carboplatin. Reduced GSR activity can increase drug cytotoxicity and side effects by making cells more susceptible to oxidative stress, while increased GSR activity can lead to drug resistance by efficiently neutralizing reactive oxygen species produced by these treatments.
