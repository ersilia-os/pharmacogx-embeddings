CYP51A1 is targeted by azole antifungal drugs, which inhibit its function important for sterol synthesis in fungi, affecting fungal cell viability. This gene is also linked to a less understood interaction with glyburide, a drug used in diabetes management, potentially through indirect effects involving cholesterol homeostasis or an unrecognized pharmacokinetic activity.
