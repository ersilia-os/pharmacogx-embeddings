Pharmacogenetic interactions in the treatment of argininosuccinic aciduria (ASA) due to ASL deficiency involve dietary protein restriction and supplementation with arginine or citrulline to enhance residual enzymatic function and facilitate ammonia detoxification. Glycerol phenylbutyrate is used to provide an alternative pathway for nitrogen excretion, managing high ammonia levels without directly modulating ASL activity.
