FK866 and GMX1778 are drugs that target the NAMPT gene, functioning as inhibitors by blocking its ability to synthesize NAD+, leading to reduced NAD+ levels, crucial in cancer treatment strategies to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. The effectiveness of these drugs can vary based on genetic variations in the NAMPT gene, affecting their efficacy and toxicity.
