There are currently no known pharmacogenetic interactions directly linking CFAP44 to specific drugs, but it is theorized that future research may reveal such interactions, especially with medications for conditions like primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) that involve impaired ciliary function. Indirectly, drugs targeting pathways that influence ciliary motility might be affected by variations in the CFAP44 gene.
