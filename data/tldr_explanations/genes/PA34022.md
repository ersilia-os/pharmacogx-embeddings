Genetic variations in the PTPRN2 gene, which is involved in hormone exocytosis, could impact the effectiveness and metabolic response of insulin therapies in diabetes patients by potentially altering insulin secretion rates. Additionally, these variations may influence the pharmacodynamics of olanzapine, an antipsychotic known to affect glucose levels, by affecting how this drug is metabolized or how it influences hormone-related signaling, contributing to its glucose dysregulating effects.
