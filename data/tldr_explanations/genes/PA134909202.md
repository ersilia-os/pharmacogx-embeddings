SGIP1, which is involved in neuronal endocytosis and synaptic plasticity, does not have direct pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs but suggests potential influence on neurological and psychiatric medications such as antidepressants and antipsychotics due to its role in synaptic functioning. The inclusion of capecitabine, a cancer treatment prodrug metabolized to 5-fluorouracil, implies an unexplored hypothesis that SGIP1 might affect drug metabolism pathways or cellular uptake mechanisms, despite not traditionally interacting with synaptic processes.
