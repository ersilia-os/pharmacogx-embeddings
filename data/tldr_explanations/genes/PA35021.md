Variations in the TAP1 gene, which plays a crucial role in antigen processing and presentation, can affect the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapies and vaccines by influencing how antigens are transported to MHC class I molecules and presented to CD8+ T cells. Although direct drug interactions with TAP1 are not well-established, its impact on immune response mechanisms is significant, suggesting that pharmacogenetic considerations of TAP1 are important in optimizing personalized immunotherapeutic strategies.
