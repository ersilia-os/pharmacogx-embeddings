ADGRG7, expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and immune cells, might indirectly affect the action of the chemotherapeutic drug capecitabine, which is used for treating gastrointestinal cancers. Although specific studies are lacking, ADGRG7 could modulate capecitabine's pharmacodynamics by influencing the tumor microenvironment or immune responses against tumor cells.
