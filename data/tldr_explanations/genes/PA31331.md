The gene MVK, involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, influences the efficacy of drugs like canakinumab and anakinra which target inflammation in Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency (MKD). Although these drugs are not metabolized by MVK, genetic variations in MVK may indirectly affect how these drugs work due to its role in broader metabolic processes including bone metabolism, potentially affecting treatments like alendronate.
