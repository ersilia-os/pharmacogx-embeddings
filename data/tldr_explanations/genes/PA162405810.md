TMCO6's role in cellular processes like apoptosis suggests a potential pharmacodynamic interaction with fluticasone propionate, a synthetic glucocorticoid used primarily for its anti-inflammatory actions, particularly in the context of glaucoma therapy. This interaction might modulate cellular reactions to glucocorticoids, affecting drug efficacy or safety, especially concerning intraocular pressure and optic nerve protection in glaucoma patients.
