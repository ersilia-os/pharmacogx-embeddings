Salbutamol and citalopram may interact pharmacogenetically with CRHR2, a gene involved in stress response pathways. Salbutamol, used for asthma, may have its efficacy impacted by CRHR2-related stress response pathways, while the antidepressant citalopram could interact with CRHR2's role in emotional regulation, influencing its therapeutic outcomes. These interactions are considered pharmacodynamic, affecting the physiological responses these drugs are designed to target.
