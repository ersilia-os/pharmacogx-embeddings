The SERPINA3 gene, though not directly involved in drug metabolism, influences drug efficacy in disease treatments like Alzheimer's and COPD by modulating immune and inflammatory responses; for example, glucocorticoids used in COPD treatment may have varying effects based on SERPINA3 expression levels, which affect the inflammatory pathways these drugs target. This gene's regulation can therefore alter therapeutic effectiveness and adverse reactions in a pharmacodynamic context without interacting at a metabolic level.
