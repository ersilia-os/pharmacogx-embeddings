Drugs such as fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide used in cancer treatment could interact with the gene PPP2R5D, which modulates cell signaling and apoptosis pathways. Variations in PPP2R5D could influence the efficacy and toxicity of these drugs by affecting how they disrupt RNA synthesis, intercalate DNA, and form DNA crosslinks, respectively.
