Variants of the UMOD gene, which affects kidney function and ion transport, can alter the efficacy and safety of diuretics such as loop diuretics and thiazides used in conditions like autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD-UMOD). These interactions are due to the gene's role in the renal pathways that the drugs target, potentially affecting the pharmacokinetics of these drugs, impacting their clinical effectiveness and patient tolerance.
