Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator used to treat and prevent breast cancer, has its efficacy and metabolism significantly impacted by variations in the CYP2D6 gene. The activity of the CYP2D6 enzyme influences the pharmacokinetics of tamoxifen by affecting its conversion to active metabolites. However, because "LRMDA" is not a recognized gene symbol, no specific pharmacogenetic interaction profile can be provided without correcting or clarifying the gene name.
