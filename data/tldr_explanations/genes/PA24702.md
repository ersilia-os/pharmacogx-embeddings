The gene ALDH5A1 plays a significant role in neurotransmitter metabolism by converting succinic semialdehyde to succinate in the GABA degradation pathway, influencing the pharmacodynamics of GABAergic drugs. While the direct pharmacogenetic interactions of ALDH5A1 are not well documented, drugs like methadone, which acts on opioid receptors and potentially affects neurotransmitter levels, may have altered efficacy or safety in scenarios where GABA metabolism is affected due to variations in ALDH5A1 activity, such as mutations, thereby indicating a non-pharmacokinetic but clinically relevant drug-gene interaction.
