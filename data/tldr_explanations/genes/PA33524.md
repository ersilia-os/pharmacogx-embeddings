POM121L2, involved in forming the nuclear pore complex, could potentially impact the pharmacodynamics of drugs reliant on nuclear transport, such as those affecting transcription factors. However, no concrete pharmacogenetic interactions involving POM121L2 have been confirmed, with the gene's role in drug interactions remaining theoretical and largely unexplored.
