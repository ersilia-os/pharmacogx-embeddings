The enzyme CYP2C19 significantly influences the metabolism of various drugs including clopidogrel, proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, esomeprazole), antidepressants (citalopram, escitalopram), antiepileptics (phenytoin), antifungals (voriconazole), and analgesics (methadone, oxycodone), which impacts their therapeutic efficacy and safety. Variations in the CYP2C19 gene affect drug activation and metabolism, leading to different pharmacological outcomes and necessitating genotype-guided dosing to optimize treatment efficacy and minimize adverse effects.
