Variations in the PRCP gene may influence the efficacy and side effect profile of benazepril, an ACE inhibitor used to treat hypertension and heart failure, due to potential interactions affecting the drug's pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. This interaction likely involves alterations in how benazepril engages pathways controlled by PRCP, which could either enhance or diminish the drug's therapeutic outcomes depending on an individual's genetic makeup.
