SLC10A1, a gene involved in bile acid transport, significantly influences the pharmacokinetics of statins such as rosuvastatin and pravastatin by affecting their absorption and efficacy due to its role in enterohepatic circulation. Genetic variations in SLC10A1 can alter how these drugs are transported into the liver, thus impacting their effectiveness in lowering cholesterol and necessitating potential adjustments in dosages for optimal therapeutic outcomes.
