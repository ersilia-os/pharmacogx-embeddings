Hydrochlorothiazide, used for managing hypertension and Bartter syndrome, indirectly interacts with the KCNJ1 gene, which encodes a potassium channel key to ion regulation in the kidneys. While the drug does not alter the gene's function directly, it affects the renal handling of sodium and water, subsequently influencing the activity of channels encoded by KCNJ1 and impacting electrolyte balance.
