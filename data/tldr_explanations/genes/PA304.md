SCN5A, a gene important for cardiac rhythm regulation, influences the interaction with class I antiarrhythmic drugs like lidocaine, flecainide, and quinidine, which block sodium channels it encodes. Variants in SCN5A can modify the effectiveness and safety of these drugs, potentially leading to altered therapeutic outcomes or increased risk of drug-induced arrhythmias, highlighting the importance of genetic consideration in personalized medical treatment for arrhythmias.
