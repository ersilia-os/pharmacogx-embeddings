APEX1, integral to the DNA base excision repair pathway, heavily influences the efficacy of alkylating agents like temozolomide and platinum-based drugs such as cisplatin and carboplatin by affecting tumor cell sensitivity through DNA damage repair modulation. Although APEX1 does not impact the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of drugs like fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, or mercaptopurine, its role in DNA repair can indirectly alter how these drugs affect cancer cells, primarily by modifying DNA damage responses rather than changing drug metabolism or action.
