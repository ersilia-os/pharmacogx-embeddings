VKORC1L1, similar to VKORC1, plays a role in the vitamin K cycle and potentially affects the action of warfarin, an anticoagulant that inhibits VKORC1. The interaction between VKORC1L1 and warfarin is hypothesized to be pharmacodynamic, impacting warfarinâ€™s effectiveness by providing a possible alternative pathway for vitamin K recycling, but specific evidence from clinical studies is still needed to confirm this interaction.
