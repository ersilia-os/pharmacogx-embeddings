The gene SLC31A1, which encodes the copper transporter CTR1, significantly influences the effectiveness and toxicity of platinum-based anticancer drugs like cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin by affecting their uptake into cancer cells. Variations in the gene can modify drug uptake, impacting not only the pharmacokinetics but possibly also other mechanisms such as intracellular processing or the activation of pathways that affect drug sensitivity.
