Drugs like amlodipine or verapamil, which are calcium channel blockers, potentially interact with the CACNA2D3 gene, despite not targeting the specific subtype it encodes. The gene's role in neuronal excitability and calcium regulation might affect the pharmacodynamics of these drugs, particularly influencing their effectiveness in conditions related to calcium channel dysfunction, such as epilepsy or chronic pain, through modifications in channel trafficking and activation.
