The gene MGAT4B, which plays a role in protein glycosylation, indirectly affects the pharmacodynamics of certain drugs, such as zafirlukast, montelukast, and aspirin, by possibly modifying their effectiveness and interactions through changes in glycosylation patterns of glycoproteins. Although direct interactions with these drugs are not clearly defined, the altered glycosylation could influence the drugs' activities in pathways like inflammation, suggesting an indirect pharmacogenetic interaction.
