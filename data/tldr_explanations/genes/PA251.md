NNMT (Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase) modulates the metabolism of drugs like the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil by influencing their N-methylation, impacting drug potency and toxicity. Variations in NNMT function can lead to differences in 5-fluorouracil metabolism, affecting its efficacy and contributing to drug resistance in cancer cells, thus playing a critical pharmacokinetic role in personalized cancer treatment.
