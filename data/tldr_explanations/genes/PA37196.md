UHRF1, which plays a vital role in DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling, may influence the efficacy of EGFR pathway-targeting drugs like gefitinib, afatinib, and erlotinib in cancers where it is overexpressed, such as breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers. Although the direct interactions between these drugs and UHRF1 are not well-documented, it is hypothesized that UHRF1's involvement in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation could affect tumor cell response to these treatments, suggesting that UHRF1 could be targeted to enhance the effectiveness of these drugs.
