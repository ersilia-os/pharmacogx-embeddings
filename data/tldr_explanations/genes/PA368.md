The XPA gene, integral to the nucleotide excision repair pathway, influences the response to chemotherapy drugs like cisplatin, which creates DNA crosslinks. Variations in XPA function can lead to increased sensitivity or resistance to these drugs, as they affect the cell's ability to repair DNA damage induced by the treatment, making XPA a potential biomarker for personalized chemotherapy regimes.
