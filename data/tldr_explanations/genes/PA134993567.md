The gene SIN3A, integral to the histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex, influences the effectiveness and toxicity of HDAC inhibitors like Vorinostat and Romidepsin used in cancer treatment. Variations in the SIN3A gene affect the pharmacodynamics of these drugs, potentially guiding the optimization of treatment regimens to enhance efficacy and minimize adverse effects.
