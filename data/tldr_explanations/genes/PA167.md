The **FPGS** gene plays a critical role in the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of antifolate drugs like methotrexate (MTX) by converting folate and its derivatives into polyglutamate forms, facilitating their intracellular retention and activity. Polymorphisms in the FPGS gene can significantly alter the drug's effectiveness and toxicity, necessitating adjusted doses based on individual genetic profiles to optimize treatment outcomes and minimize side effects. Additionally, FPGS variations may also potentially affect the response to drugs like warfarin due to its role in folate metabolism, though the interaction is less distinctly understood.
