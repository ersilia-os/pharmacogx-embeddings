Variations in the MTR gene, which encodes methionine synthase, significantly affect the pharmacodynamics of drugs like methotrexate by altering the enzyme's activity and consequently influencing folate and homocysteine levels in the body. This gene variation alters the efficacy and toxicity of drugs such as methotrexate and folic acid, and interactions with other medications like sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, and betaine, primarily due to changes in homocysteine and folate metabolism driven by MTR gene activity.
