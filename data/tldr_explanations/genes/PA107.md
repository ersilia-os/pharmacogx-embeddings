CES1, or Carboxylesterase 1, plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of various drugs by hydrolyzing ester and amide bonds, affecting both the therapeutic efficacy and safety. For instance, genetic variations in CES1 can alter the activation rate of clopidogrel into its effective antiplatelet form and affect the metabolism of methylphenidate used in ADHD, impacting drug effectiveness and side effects. Additionally, CES1 converts prodrugs like enalapril and oseltamivir into active metabolites, and also influences the metabolism of drugs like heroin and sacubitril, which are critical for their therapeutic action and potential toxicity.
