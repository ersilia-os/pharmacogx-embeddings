DHRS4L1, related to the DHRS4 gene and a member of the SDR family, could indirectly influence drug metabolism due to its role in reducing aldehydes and ketones to alcohols. This function may impact the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are metabolized through similar reduction pathways or require such reactions for activation or deactivation, particularly those involved in steroid or lipid metabolism.
