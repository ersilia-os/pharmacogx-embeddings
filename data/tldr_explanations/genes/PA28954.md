GPX6, a gene primarily involved in reducing oxidative stress in olfactory tissues, has not been significantly linked to pharmacogenetic interactions due to its restricted expression and the limited research connecting it with systemic drug interactions. Currently, no drugs are known to have pharmacogenetic interactions with GPX6, reflecting the challenges of studying localized enzymes in broader pharmacogenetic contexts.
