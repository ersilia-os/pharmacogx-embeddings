The drugs rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, and pravastatin, which are statins, primarily affect cholesterol levels and indirectly influence various lipoproteins, including Lp(a), through pharmacodynamic interactions by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase; however, their direct pharmacogenetic effects on LPA gene interactions specifically regarding Lp(a) levels are not well-defined. Aspirin, while used for managing cardiovascular risks, does not target Lp(a) levels directly but may manage associated conditions like vascular inflammation and thrombotic risk, thereby indirectly influencing LPA gene-related pathways.
