Variants in the MGST1 gene can alter the metabolism of drugs, particularly chemotherapeutic and cardiovascular drugs, by affecting glutathione conjugation detoxification rates and response to oxidative stress. This may influence the efficacy and safety of these drugs, as MGST1 variants could lead to variability in patient responses, impacting therapeutic outcomes and the likelihood of adverse effects.
