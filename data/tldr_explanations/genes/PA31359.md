In neuroblastoma, the amplification of the MYCN gene is associated with resistance to standard chemotherapeutic drugs, prompting the development of drugs like BET inhibitors and Aurora kinase inhibitors. BET inhibitors reduce MYCN expression at the transcriptional level, while Aurora kinase inhibitors impact the cell cycle and apoptosis pathways affected by MYCN, aiming to overcome the resistance caused by MYCN amplification.
