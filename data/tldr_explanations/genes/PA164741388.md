DLG2, linked with synaptic function and neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, impacts the effectiveness and side effects of antipsychotic drugs through its role in synaptic signaling pathways, whereby genetic variations might alter drug responses. Although there is a mention of the gene potentially affecting responses to non-antipsychotic drugs like anastrozole, used in breast cancer hormone therapy, this remains speculative with insufficient evidence directly connecting DLG2 to anastrozole.
