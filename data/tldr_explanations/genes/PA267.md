The ABCB1 gene, encoding P-glycoprotein, is crucial in modulating the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of multiple drugs by acting as an efflux transporter that influences their absorption, distribution, and excretion. This gene affects the bioavailability and brain penetration of various drugs such as antivirals like efavirenz and ritonavir, chemotherapeutics like doxorubicin and paclitaxel, cardiovascular drugs like digoxin, immunosuppressants such as tacrolimus and sirolimus, and analgesics like morphine and codeine, necessitating dosage adjustments and careful monitoring in clinical practice for optimized therapeutic outcomes.
