PSORS1C2, a gene associated with psoriasis susceptibility, may subtly affect the response to treatments like allopurinol, which is used for its anti-inflammatory effects in psoriasis, despite no direct pharmacokinetic interaction. Variants in PSORS1C2 could potentially influence the efficacy and safety of psoriasis therapies, particularly those targeting immune pathways, such as biologics and systemic medications.
