Mutations in the DNMT3A gene, essential in DNA methylation, can affect responses to drugs like decitabine and azacitidine in treatments for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes by influencing the drugs' effectiveness in inhibiting DNA methyltransferases and altering gene expression. While DNMT3A's interaction with warfarin appears minimal and likely indirect, affecting warfarin sensitivity or metabolism through epigenetic or indirect gene pathway regulations rather than through a direct pharmacogenetic interaction.
