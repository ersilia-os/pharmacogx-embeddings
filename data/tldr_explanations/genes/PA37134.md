The gene UBE2I, which catalyzes protein sumoylation, impacts the pharmacodynamics of the anticancer drug irinotecan by potentially altering sumoylation patterns. This change can modify the activity or stability of proteins involved in DNA repair mechanisms, thus affecting irinotecan's effectiveness against cancer cells.
