Drugs such as octreotide and lanreotide, which target the growth hormone receptor, indirectly affect the IGF2's signaling pathway by potentially reducing the mitogenic and pro-survival influences of the IGF1R/IGF2 pathway in diseases where IGF2 is overexpressed, such as certain cancers. These interactions are pharmacodynamic, influencing how the body responds to growth signals modulated by IGF2, without changing the pharmacokinetics of IGF2 itself.
