PDE11A, which degrades cAMP and cGMP, may interact with drugs that influence cyclic nucleotide levels, such as desipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant. Although desipramine does not directly affect cAMP or cGMP, it may interact with PDE11A in neural pathways, potentially affecting the drug's efficacy or side effects due to PDE11A's role in regulating cyclic nucleotides and related signaling pathways.
