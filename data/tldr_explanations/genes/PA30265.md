The LAG3 gene regulates immune responses and is key in cancer immunotherapy, highlighted by the interaction with the drug relatlimab, an anti-LAG-3 antibody that blocks the protein's inhibitory effects on T cells, enhancing immune responses against tumors. Relatlimab, in combination with nivolumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, synergistically inhibits multiple immune checkpoints, significantly improving treatment efficacy against melanoma and other solid tumors, particularly in cases resistant to PD-1 inhibitor therapies alone.
