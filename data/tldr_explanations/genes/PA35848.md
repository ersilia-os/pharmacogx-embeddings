Genetic variations in the SLC22A7 gene, which encodes for the Organic Anion Transporter 3 (OAT3), significantly affect the renal excretion and therefore the clearance, efficacy, and toxicity of various drugs such as cefotaxime, oseltamivir, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, and capecitabine. These interactions might influence not just the pharmacokinetics but also the therapeutic and toxic effects of these drugs due to the role of OAT3 in altering their availability at cellular or tissue levels.
