RGS17 indirectly affects the action of various drugs, including beta blockers, antipsychotics, and opioids by modulating the activities of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which these drugs target for conditions like hypertension, psychiatric disorders, and pain. Although direct interactions of RGS17 with these drugs are not established, its influence on GPCR signaling could impact the efficacy and side effects of these medications.
