SLC2A2, or Glucose Transporter Type 2, interacts pharmacogenetically with drugs like metformin that manage diabetes by modulating glucose levels. While metformin does not directly affect SLC2A2, it influences the pathways regulated by SLC2A2, such as hepatic glucose production and insulin sensitivity, indirectly impacting the gene's role in glucose transport and sensing in the liver and pancreas, which may affect metformin's effectiveness.
