Variants in the FCER1G gene, which codes for the gamma subunit of the Fc epsilon RI receptor involved in IgE-mediated allergic responses, could alter the efficacy of drugs like omalizumab, which targets IgE and influences the pathway moderated by this receptor. This interaction is pharmacodynamic in nature, affecting how drugs modulate immune responses based on the genetic variations in the FCER1G-mediated pathway, rather than altering drug metabolism directly.
