PGM1, involved in glucose metabolism, does not have documented direct pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions with specific drugs, reflecting a lack of specific pharmacogenetic data. While its mutations can influence metabolic disorders, no established drug interactions based on genetic variations in PGM1 are identified, with potential drug interactions remaining speculative.
