The PGR gene's pharmacogenetic profile is crucial in managing hormone-responsive conditions like breast cancer, guiding the use of endocrine therapies such as tamoxifen, anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane. These drugs depend on the functional presence and polymorphisms of PGR for effectiveness, with the gene modulating the pharmacodynamics of treatments, thereby influencing how cancer cells respond to hormone manipulation and targeted therapies.
