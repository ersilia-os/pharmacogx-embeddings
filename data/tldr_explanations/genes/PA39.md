Variations in the ADRB2 gene can significantly impact the effectiveness and metabolism of beta-agonists like albuterol, salbutamol, and terbutaline used in treating respiratory conditions such as asthma and COPD, by altering receptor function and influencing drug response. Additionally, ADRB2 gene mutations can affect how beta-blockers such as metoprolol and propranolol used in cardiac conditions work, and influence the effects of anesthetic drugs like propofol and fentanyl, highlighting the necessity of tailoring therapeutic approaches based on individual genetic profiles to optimize treatment outcomes.
