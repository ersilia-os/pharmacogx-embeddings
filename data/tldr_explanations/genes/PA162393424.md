Leucovorin, fluorouracil, and irinotecan do not directly interact with the KLC1 gene from a pharmacokinetic perspective; however, due to KLC1's involvement in neuronal function, there may be pharmacodynamic implications, especially concerning their neurotoxic side effects and impact on neuronal transport mechanisms. There is currently no established direct pharmacogenetic interaction between these drugs and KLC1, but the gene's role could potentially influence the drugs' effects on the nervous system.
