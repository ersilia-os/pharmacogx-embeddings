Doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic agent, relies on the activation of the CASP3 gene, involved in apoptosis pathways, to effectively induce cell death in cancer treatments. Variations in CASP3 may influence the drug's effectiveness by affecting how it induces apoptosis, central to doxorubicin's action against cancer cells.
