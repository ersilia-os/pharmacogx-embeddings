Ganaxolone, a neuroactive steroid that modulates the GABAá´€ receptor, may have varying efficacy in managing seizures in patients with CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder (CDD) due to its pharmacodynamic interaction with mutations in the CDKL5 gene, which affects neuronal signaling pathways and synaptic function. This variability highlights the importance of tailoring therapeutic strategies to specific genetic variants to optimize treatment outcomes in personalized medicine.
