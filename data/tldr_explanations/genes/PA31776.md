NRG1 plays a significant role in pharmacogenetics, particularly impacting the efficacy of cancer treatments like trastuzumab, an ErbB2 receptor inhibitor used in breast cancer, by affecting how cancer cells respond to these inhibitors through its interaction with the ErbB receptor family. In psychiatry, variability in NRG1 might influence patient responses to antipsychotic medications in conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder due to its involvement in neural development and synaptic plasticity, although the specific drugs affected have not been fully identified.
