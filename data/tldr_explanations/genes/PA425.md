ACE inhibitors like captopril and benazepril, while not directly targeting ACE2, influence its expression and activity indirectly by reducing the levels of angiotensin II, which can lead to an increase in ACE2 activity. This alteration impacts the balance of angiotensin peptides, thereby affecting blood pressure regulation and cardiovascular function due to a complex interaction that involves both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic elements.
