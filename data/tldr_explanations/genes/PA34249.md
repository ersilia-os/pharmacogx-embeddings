The ARID4A gene, involved in chromatin remodeling, could potentially influence the pharmacodynamics of anticancer therapies by affecting how drugs targeting epigenetic modifications, like DNA methylation inhibitors or histone deacetylase inhibitors, interact with the cell's chromatin and gene expression. While no specific drug interactions with ARID4A are well-documented, alterations in the geneâ€™s function or expression might change the sensitivity or resistance of cancer cells to these therapies by modulating the accessibility and regulatory mechanisms of the cell's chromatin structure critical for drug effectiveness.
