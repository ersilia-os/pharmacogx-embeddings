GSTO2 plays a key role in the metabolism and detoxification of drugs, especially through its function in glutathione conjugation pathways and handling of oxidative products. Genetic variations in GSTO2 might affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs that either resemble the metabolic pathway of arsenic or induce oxidative stress, potentially altering the efficacy or toxicity of these drugs.
