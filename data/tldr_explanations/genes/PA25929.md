LSM2, involved in mRNA processing, does not directly interact with drugs like abacavir and flucloxacillin, which are metabolized by different pathways and target different mechanisms. Any potential influence of LSM2 on the efficacy of these drugs remains speculative, as the gene might indirectly affect immune responses or viral replication (in the case of abacavir) and host immune responses or bacterial dynamics (in the case of flucloxacillin), but these interactions are not yet established in scientific research.
