SPSB2, which regulates cytokine signaling and impacts nitric oxide production, may indirectly affect the effectiveness or side-effects of methylphenidate, a drug used for ADHD, due to its influence on nitric oxide pathways involved in neurotransmission and vascular functions in the CNS. Although there are no direct interactions between SPSB2 and methylphenidate, the gene's role in nitric oxide regulation could theoretically alter the drug's pharmacodynamic properties.
