LRP1B mutations or deletions are linked to varying responses in cancer therapies, particularly affecting the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors in lung cancer by altering cellular signaling pathways. Additionally, LRP1B might also impact the therapeutic outcomes of the drug risperidone, an example of a non-pharmacokinetic interaction, possibly through neurochemical pathways in the brain, although the precise mechanism remains to be fully understood.
