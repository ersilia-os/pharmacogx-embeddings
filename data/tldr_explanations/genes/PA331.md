SLC22A2, functioning as the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), plays a key role in the renal elimination of various drugs, including metformin, acyclovir, ganciclovir, oxaliplatin, cimetidine, and l-tryptophan, with genetic variations affecting their pharmacokinetics. Reduced activity of SLC22A2 can limit the elimination of drugs like metformin, potentially increasing its efficacy but also raising the risk of toxicity, while other drugs might experience altered efficacy and safety due to changes in exposure levels caused by interactions and competition at the transporter level.
