The HTR1B gene, encoding the serotonin receptor 1B, plays a crucial role in the pharmacogenetics of various psychiatric and neurological drugs by influencing their pharmacodynamics. This includes interactions with SSRIs like escitalopram and fluoxetine; SNRIs such as venlafaxine; serotonin antagonists like nefazodone; and other medications, adjusting their efficacy through modulation of serotonin receptor activation, neurotransmitter release, and—in certain cases—impacting serotonergic control of vascular tone and nociception as with sumatriptan. This gene also possibly affects the response to antipsychotics and the interaction with substances impacting addictive behaviors and mood, such as nicotine, heroin, and liothyronine.
