The KIF6 gene, particularly its 719Arg variant, is associated with differing responses to statins like rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin in managing cholesterol and reducing cardiovascular events. The gene's interaction with these drugs is pharmacodynamic, influencing the drugs' efficacy through modulation of cardiovascular risk rather than affecting the metabolism or elimination of the statins.
