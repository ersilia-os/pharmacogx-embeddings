Statins such as atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin, which primarily inhibit HMG-CoA reductase to lower cholesterol, may indirectly influence cell adhesion and migration in brain and kidney cells through their effects on lipid metabolism. Although the interaction between these drugs and the CLMN gene, which affects cellular processes like shape and migration, is not well established in pharmacogenetics, it's hypothesized that changes in lipid composition and cellular health might impact the cellular functions regulated by CLMN.
