The SOST gene, which encodes sclerostin and regulates bone formation, is targeted by osteoporosis drugs like romosozumab that inhibit its activity to promote bone growth and reduce resorption, useful especially in postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment. While alendronate, another osteoporosis drug, primarily inhibits osteoclast activity, its effectiveness may be indirectly affected by SOST genetic variations, impacting bone density and turnover.
