Variations in the FCGR2A gene affect the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapies such as rituximab and trastuzumab by altering how immune cells mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, impacting treatment outcomes for diseases like autoimmune disorders and HER2-positive breast cancer. FCGR2A gene polymorphisms also influence the efficacy of the antiplatelet agent clopidogrel through modulation of platelet activation and aggregation, with additional implications for drugs like paclitaxel, doxorubicin, fenofibrate, and cyclophosphamide in immune modulation pathways.
