IPCEF1, which regulates ARF family GTPases important for cellular functions, does not interact directly with drugs like methadone. However, it has an indirect influence on how drugs affect the cell by modulating signaling pathways involved in critical cellular responses, such as survival and apoptosis, potentially affecting the cellular impact of drugs in conditions like cancer or immune disorders.
