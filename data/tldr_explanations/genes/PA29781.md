Oprelvekin, interacting pharmacogenetically with IL11, varies in therapeutic effect due to genetic differences in the IL11 receptor and STAT3 pathway, influencing side effects like fluid retention and cardiac issues in patients treated for chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. Additionally, while not definitively proven, the interaction between IL11 and escitalopram may theoretically exist due to IL11's role in neuroinflammatory processes, potentially affecting the antidepressant's efficacy or side effects.
