OPCML, an opioid-binding protein involved in cell adhesion and neurological and cancer processes, does not notably affect the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate, a drug used for ADHD. However, OPCML may indirectly influence the pharmacodynamics of methylphenidate through its modulation of neuronal cell adhesion and opioid receptor activities, potentially impacting the drug's effectiveness or required dosage in patients with altered OPCML expression due to certain neurological conditions or cancers.
