PEBP4 is involved in cancer-related cellular processes like apoptosis and cell proliferation, which suggests potential interactions with chemotherapeutic agents though specific drugs are not clearly identified. The gene's interaction with methylphenidate, primarily used for ADHD, appears speculative and may involve indirect effects on neurological functions or off-target pharmacodynamic effects, as direct pharmacokinetic interactions with PEBP4 have not been established.
