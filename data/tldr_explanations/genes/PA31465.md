Drugs such as prednisone and cyclophosphamide, used in inflammatory conditions, and chemotherapeutic agents like doxorubicin and vincristine, which generate reactive oxygen species, could have altered efficacy or risk profiles due to variations in NCF4. These interactions, which mainly involve pharmacodynamics relationships, are suggested by the gene's role in regulating oxidative stress pathways, though direct pharmacogenetic evidence is sparse.
