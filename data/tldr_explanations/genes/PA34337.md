REV3L, in its role in DNA repair, affects the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs including cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil, and capecitabine. Variants in the REV3L gene can alter DNA repair capacity, influencing the pharmacogenetic interactions and thereby determining the therapeutic outcomes and adverse effects of these drugs, particularly in how they handle DNA damage induced by treatment.
