C6orf15, a gene with suspected enzymatic activity and expression in immune-related tissues, may impact the pharmacodynamics of chemotherapy drugs like carboplatin and gemcitabine, potentially affecting their efficacy and toxicity due to its role in immune modulation. The exact pharmacogenetic interactions remain speculative without concrete data, though the gene's link to immune responses suggests possible relevance in the context of cancer treatment.
