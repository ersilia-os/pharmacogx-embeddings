GLT1D1, while not having strong direct pharmacogenetic links to specific drugs, impacts drug metabolism and response through its role in glycosylation, notably concerning proteins and lipids. The gene may influence the effectiveness or safety of zileuton, an asthma drug, by modifying glycosylated molecules in the inflammatory response pathways, although these interactions remain speculative without direct evidence.
