FOXO1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of insulin signaling affecting the efficacy of diabetes drugs such as metformin and thiazolidinediones by enhancing insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake. In cancer therapy, FOXO1 affects the effectiveness of drugs like fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide, used in breast cancer treatments, by modulating apoptotic pathways and influencing responses to oxidative stress, which are essential for the drugs' action on cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.
