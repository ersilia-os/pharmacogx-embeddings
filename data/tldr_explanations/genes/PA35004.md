The efficacy and safety of antiepileptic drugs such as phenytoin, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine, which target sodium channels, can vary significantly depending on the variants of the SCN2A gene that influences these channels' function. While drugs like phenobarbital, topiramate, valproic acid, and oxcarbazepine do not primarily target sodium channels, their indirect effects on neuronal excitability may also be influenced by variations in SCN2A, necessitating personalized drug choices and dosages based on genetic makeup.
