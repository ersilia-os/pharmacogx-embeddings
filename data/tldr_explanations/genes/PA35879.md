The SLC2A4 gene (GLUT4) plays a crucial role in the pharmacogenetics of diabetes treatments such as metformin and thiazolidinediones (e.g., pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) by influencing insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in cells. Variants in the SLC2A4 gene can alter GLUT4's expression or activity, thus impacting the effectiveness of these drugs in improving insulin sensitivity and glucose absorption, which focuses on pharmacodynamic interactions relevant to personalized diabetic treatment strategies.
