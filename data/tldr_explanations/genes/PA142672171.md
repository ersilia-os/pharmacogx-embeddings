NSRP1, involved in mRNA processing and alternative splicing, does not have well-documented direct pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs, including capecitabine, a prodrug converted to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). However, variations in NSRP1 may indirectly influence the pharmacodynamic aspects of capecitabine by affecting gene expression and enzyme availability, thereby potentially impacting the conversion of capecitabine into its active form, 5-FU.
