There are currently no established pharmacogenetic interactions involving the TBC1D32 gene, which is known to play a role in cellular regulatory processes but has no confirmed impact on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of specific drugs. Any discussion on the pharmacogenetics of TBC1D32 remains speculative without concrete evidence of drug interactions.
