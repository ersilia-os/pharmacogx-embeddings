The IL21R gene, involved in immune response regulation, might affect the efficacy or safety of drugs like ribavirin, used for autoimmune diseases and cancers, due to its role in the JAK-STAT signaling pathways. Although the pharmacogenetic interactions of IL21R with drugs such as ribavirin are speculative, they could be related to the drug's immunomodulatory effects impacting these pathways and immune cell functions.
