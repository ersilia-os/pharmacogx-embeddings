ATP7A primarily influences pharmacogenetics in the context of managing copper-related metabolic disorders like Menkes disease through copper supplementation or chelation therapies; however, drugs like docetaxel and thalidomide, although mentioned in relation to ATP7A, do not show direct pharmacogenetic interactions. This suggests that the relevance of ATP7A in pharmacogenetics is more focused on disease management associated with copper metabolism rather than direct interactions with these drugs.
