CRY1, a gene important in regulating circadian rhythms, impacts the pharmacokinetics of drugs by potentially influencing their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion based on the timing of their administration. Although there are no specific drugs conclusively linked to interactions with CRY1, its role in circadian biology could notably affect the efficacy and side effects of medications such as mood stabilizers and hypnotics, which are administered at times that align with circadian phases.
