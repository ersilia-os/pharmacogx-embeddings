Variants of the CDKAL1 gene, which is involved in modifying tRNA for accurate protein synthesis, can impact insulin secretion and potentially affect the pharmacodynamics of drugs like sulfonylureas, which are used to stimulate insulin secretion in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Although the exact drug interactions are not yet clearly established, understanding the gene's influence on pancreatic beta-cell function could help in personalizing antidiabetic treatments based on genetic profiles.
