SULT1B1, an enzyme crucial in the phase II metabolism of drugs, plays a role in the sulfation of thyroid hormones, xenobiotics, and possibly steroid hormones, suggesting that drugs undergoing similar sulfation, such as acetaminophen, might interact with it. The expression of this enzyme in the liver, kidney, and digestive tract underscores its significant impact on drug detoxification, bioavailability, and elimination, highlighting the importance of understanding its activity to predict drug response variability.
