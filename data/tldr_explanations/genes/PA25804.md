Variations in the TRIB3 gene influence the efficacy and metabolism of metformin in treating type 2 diabetes due to differences in drug metabolism efficiency linked to genetic polymorphisms. Although not directly researched, TRIB3 might also affect the therapeutic response or metabolism of methylphenidate, used in ADHD treatment, likely through pathways related to neural signaling or stress responses.
