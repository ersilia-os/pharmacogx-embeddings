Drugs like erdafitinib, pazopanib, sunitinib, and infigratinib are pharmacogenetically significant as they target the tyrosine kinase domain of the FGFR2 gene, which plays a critical role in cancer cell proliferation and survival. Each drug interacts differently: erdafitinib is used for cancers with FGFR mutations including urothelial carcinoma; pazopanib and sunitinib broadly inhibit kinases impacting angiogenesis and tumor growth in various cancers; and infigratinib specifically targets FGFR1-3 and is used for cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 fusions. These interactions affect cancer cell behavior via FGFR2 pathways, emphasizing the importance of FGFR2 genetics in cancer therapy.
