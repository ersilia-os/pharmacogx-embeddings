Larotrectinib and entrectinib are pan-TRK inhibitors that target the TrkC protein activated by NTRK3 gene fusions, effectively inhibiting the kinase activity of TrkC and disrupting oncogenic signaling pathways. This direct inhibition is crucial in treating cancers with these specific genetic alterations, representing a major progress in targeted cancer therapy.
