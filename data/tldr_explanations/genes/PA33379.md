PLAGL1, a gene involved in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation, is suggested to have potential pharmacodynamic interactions with drugs like olanzapine, which is used for psychiatric conditions and associated with significant metabolic side effects. This interaction aligns with PLAGL1's influence on metabolic pathways, potentially affecting the efficacy and safety of medications targeting metabolic or oncological disorders.
