The gene RRP7A, involved in ribosomal RNA processing, can potentially affect the efficacy of anticancer drugs targeting ribosomal function by influencing protein synthesis and cell proliferation. Although not well-established, there is a speculative, indirect connection suggested between RRP7A and the drug methylphenidate, which primarily affects neurotransmitter processes, implying that changes in RRP7A may indirectly affect cellular pathways involved in both ribosomal function and neurotransmitter availability.
