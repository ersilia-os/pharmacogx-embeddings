Variants in the GSS gene can influence the efficacy and toxicity of drugs like acetaminophen by modifying the availability of glutathione, which detoxifies reactive oxidative intermediates during drug metabolism. Reduced GSS activity is linked to increased risk of drug-induced oxidative stress and liver damage, such as acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity, due to diminished detoxification capacity.
