The gene RHBDF2, involved in the EGF receptor signaling pathway, does not have direct, recognized drug interactions but potentially influences drug responses, particularly in therapies targeting EGFR, like cancer treatments. Although opioids such as fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine are mentioned, their interaction with RHBDF2 seems speculative and is more related to possible effects on drug distribution via epithelial tissues, rather than through direct involvement with EGF signaling pathways.
