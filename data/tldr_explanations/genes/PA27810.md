The EPB41 gene, important for maintaining red blood cell structure, indirectly affects the pharmacodynamics of drugs like bupropion and nicotine in patients with hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) or hereditary spherocytosis (HS). In these conditions, altered red blood cell morphology might change the hemodynamic responses to these substances, potentially impacting their efficacy and risk profiles due to modified blood flow and oxygen delivery, and cellular deformability.
