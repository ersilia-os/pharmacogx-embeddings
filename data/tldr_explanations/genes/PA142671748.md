The GAPVD1 gene, known for its role in intracellular trafficking and endocytosis, indirectly affects drug metabolism and response. However, no specific drugs have been identified as interacting pharmacogenetically with GAPVD1, and its role in pharmacogenetics—particularly in differentiating pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics—is not clearly established.
