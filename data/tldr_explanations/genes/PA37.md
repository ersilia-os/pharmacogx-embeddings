The ADRA2C gene, responsible for encoding the Alpha-2C adrenergic receptor, significantly influences the response to certain cardiovascular and psychiatric drugs like clonidine, metoprolol, and bucindolol, by regulating neurotransmitter release, particularly norepinephrine. Variants in the ADRA2C gene can affect the efficacy and side-effect profiles of these drugs, as they impact pharmacodynamic interactions, altering patient responses through modulation of adrenergic pathways.
