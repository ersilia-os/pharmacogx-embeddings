CYP1A1, an important enzyme in drug metabolism, exhibits pharmacogenetic interactions that impact the efficacy and toxicity of drugs like theophylline and clozapine through variations in metabolic activity based on genetic differences. Drugs such as deferasirox, valproic acid, and caffeine among others show altered pharmacokinetics when metabolized by CYP1A1, while others like imatinib and nilotinib might have altered pharmacodynamics or metabolism influenced by CYP1A1 activity, affecting treatment outcomes especially in cancer therapy.
