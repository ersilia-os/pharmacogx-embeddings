Drugs such as linsitinib and figitumumab, which are tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting the IGF1R gene, block its kinase activity to inhibit downstream signaling pathways involved in tumor cell proliferation and survival. Meanwhile, tamoxifen interacts with the IGF1R gene in a different manner, potentially influencing growth factor pathways through its role as an estrogen receptor modulator. These interactions highlight the significant pharmacogenetic implications of the IGF1R gene in cancer therapy, affecting the effectiveness and safety of these treatments.
