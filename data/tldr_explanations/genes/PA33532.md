Genetic variations in the POR gene, which is crucial for the function of Cytochrome P450 Oxidoreductase, can significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs such as bupropion, nicotine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, midazolam, voriconazole, and methadone by altering their metabolism and necessitating dose adjustments. While drugs like atorvastatin and sunitinib are also influenced by POR, their interaction is less directly related to its metabolic role, and other drugs such as aspirin and warfarin show complex pharmacodynamic interactions with POR-modulated enzymes rather than straightforward metabolic effects.
