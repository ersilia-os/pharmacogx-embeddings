The FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene, which is associated with FIP1L1, is sensitive to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib, used effectively in treating disorders like chronic eosinophilic leukemia and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome by inhibiting aberrant kinase activity. In contrast, the exact pharmacogenetic relationship between FIP1L1 and meperidine is not clearly established, potentially involving broader systemic effects rather than a direct interaction.
