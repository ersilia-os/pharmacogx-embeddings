P-selectin, regulated by the SELP gene, interacts with drugs like specific antibodies that inhibit its binding to the ligand PSGL-1, thereby reducing inflammation and platelet aggregation. Variations in the SELP gene, such as the S290N polymorphism, can affect individual responses to these drugs, impacting the effectiveness and safety of treatments for conditions like coronary artery disease.
