Mutations in the TET2 gene, which is involved in DNA demethylation, affect the effectiveness of hypomethylating agents like azacitidine and decitabine used in treating hematological malignancies such as myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. While TET2's interaction with hydrochlorothiazide is noted, its influence on the drug is less clear, possibly hinting at a broader metabolic or regulatory role of TET2 that indirectly affects the drug's pathway.
