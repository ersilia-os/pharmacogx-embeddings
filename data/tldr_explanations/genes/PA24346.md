PTGS1, which encodes Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), is crucial in pharmacodynamic interactions with drugs like aspirin, indomethacin, celecoxib, rofecoxib, clopidogrel, and latanoprost, impacting their therapeutic efficacy and safety. Drugs such as aspirin directly inhibit PTGS1 to prevent platelet aggregation, while selective COX-2 inhibitors like celecoxib aim to spare PTGS1 to minimize gastrointestinal side effects; clopidogrel and latanoprost indirectly interact with PTGS1, affecting pathways like platelet aggregation and fluid outflow in the eye, respectively.
