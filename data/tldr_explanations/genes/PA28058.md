Omalizumab and budesonide, drugs used in asthma management, both interact with the FCER2 gene which plays a crucial role in modulating IgE levels and B-cell activity, important in asthma's immunological responses. Variations in the FCER2 gene may impact the efficacy of omalizumab, which targets IgE, and budesonide, known for its anti-inflammatory effects but also possibly influencing B-cell mediated responses, thereby suggesting the need for personalized treatment based on FCER2 genetic variants.
