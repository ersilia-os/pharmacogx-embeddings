Drugs that interact with the BMP signaling pathway, like certain inhibitors used in cancer therapies, might be influenced by variations in BMP5's function or expression, given BMP5's role in bone formation and involvement in this pathway. Additionally, the antidepressant escitalopram is suggested to have a potential—but not directly evidenced—interaction with BMP5, possibly due to BMP signaling's broad effects, which could extend to neurological pathways relevant to the drug's mechanism.
