DHRS4L2, a gene involved in the metabolism of steroids, prostaglandins, retinol, and lipids, may affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs processed through similar metabolic pathways. Drugs like corticosteroids, hormonal therapies, and retinoid-based treatments such as isotretinoin might have altered efficacy or safety due to variations in the function or expression of DHRS4L2, particularly because of this gene's significant activity in liver and kidney tissues.
