TPP1 mutations, responsible for CLN2 disease, lead to protein build-up due to enzymatic deficiency; this can be addressed pharmacogenetically through enzyme replacement therapy with Cerliponase alfa, a recombinant TPP1. The effectiveness of this treatment depends on the patient's genetic status, highlighting a need for genetic testing prior to initiation as it compensates for the enzyme deficiency, thus improving protein breakdown in affected patients.
