BMP7 is involved in bone and kidney development and repair, and could potentially influence the treatment outcomes of drugs like doxorubicin, daunorubicin, vincristine, and others used for cancer and autoimmune conditions by affecting cellular differentiation and tissue repair. However, there are no confirmed pharmacogenetic interactions that directly link BMP7 with changes in the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of these drugs, making any potential influence theoretical and unproven.
