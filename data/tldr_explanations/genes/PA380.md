Ethosuximide and lamotrigine, antiepileptic drugs, interact with the CACNA1H gene, which encodes the T-type voltage-dependent calcium channel subunit alpha-1H, crucial for managing epilepsy. These interactions are likely pharmacodynamic, involving direct modulation of the T-type calcium channels, which influences the drugs' efficacy and side effects profiles, dependent on genetic variants of CACNA1H.
