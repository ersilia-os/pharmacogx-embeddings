Variations in the ADIPOQ gene can significantly influence the effectiveness of pioglitazone, a drug used in managing type 2 diabetes, by altering adiponectin levels and thus affecting insulin sensitivity. While interactions between ADIPOQ and the no longer used obesity drug sibutramine, as well as isotretinoin for severe acne, are plausible given adiponectin's metabolic roles, these connections are less clearly defined compared to those with pioglitazone.
