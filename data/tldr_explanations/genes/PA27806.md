The EOMES gene, which regulates immune cell development and function, may affect the efficacy of immunotherapeutic drugs like checkpoint inhibitors due to its role in immune cell functionality. Variations in EOMES expression or function could theoretically alter the immune response effectiveness against cancer cells, impacting the pharmacodynamics of immunotherapies.
