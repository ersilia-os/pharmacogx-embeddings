The TAC1 gene, which influences pain perception through peptides like substance P, interacts pharmacogenetically with NK1 receptor antagonists such as aprepitant and fosaprepitant, used to mitigate chemotherapy-induced nausea. Variations in TAC1 gene expression can affect how individuals respond to these drugs and to oxaliplatin, which may have increased neuropathic side effects due to its interaction with TAC1-related pathways.
