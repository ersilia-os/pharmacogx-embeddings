The gene AGBL4, involved in modifying microtubules in the brain, implies potential pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs that affect microtubule stability, such as antimitotic cancer drugs, although no direct evidence of such interactions is currently confirmed. Additionally, AGBL4 may interact with drugs like Rifampin through broader pharmacodynamic effects, potentially affecting neuronal functions or development through mechanisms related to cellular stress or inflammation, rather than through direct enzymatic modifications of microtubules.
