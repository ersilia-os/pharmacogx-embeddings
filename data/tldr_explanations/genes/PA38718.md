PIGM, which is essential for glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis, influences the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs by affecting the localization of proteins on cell membranes. For instance, in the case of methylphenidate—a medication used for ADHD—PIGM may alter the drug's effectiveness by modifying the distribution or action of GPI-anchored proteins at neural synapses.
