The gene ADCY9 affects the efficacy of the antiplatelet drug ticagrelor by modulating its effectiveness through variations in the gene, indicating that genetic profiling could personalize therapy for better outcomes. Additionally, ADCY9 may enhance the bronchodilatory effects of salbutamol and impact the efficacy of dalcetrapib in lipid modulation, due to its role in cAMP-mediated pathways, suggesting a complex role in drug responses.
