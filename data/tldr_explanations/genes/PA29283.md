Topotecan, an anticancer drug, reduces HIF1A levels and counters tumor resistance by affecting the protein's stability and expression, primarily through pharmacodynamic mechanisms. Additionally, tyrosine kinase inhibitors like Sorafenib, Pazopanib, and Axitinib may indirectly impact HIF1A activity by targeting pathways, including VEGF pathways downstream of HIF1A, suggesting their inhibition could suppress tumor growth by reducing HIF1A-mediated angiogenic factor transcription. These interactions are key in understanding the drugs' effectiveness in cancer therapies involving HIF1A and hypoxia.
