Entrectinib and larotrectinib sulfate are TRK inhibitors targeting cancers with NTRK1 gene alterations, effectively blocking the tyrosine kinase activity of TrkA, which is vital for tumor growth in cells with mutated or overexpressed TrkA. Other drugs like epinephrine, aspirin, and prasugrel, although not directly interacting pharmacokinetically, may influence or be influenced by pathways affected by TrkA signaling due to its role in neural functions and physiological responses such as pain perception and inflammation.
