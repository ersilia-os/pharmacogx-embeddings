The MC4R gene is targeted by setmelanotide, a drug that acts as a direct agonist of the melanocortin 4 receptor to effectively manage obesity by compensating for defective signaling caused by specific genetic mutations. Other drugs like temozolomide, ziprasidone, and olanzapine, although they impact the central nervous system and can cause weight changes, do not interact directly with MC4R, influencing energy balance and body weight through neurotransmitter pathways instead.
