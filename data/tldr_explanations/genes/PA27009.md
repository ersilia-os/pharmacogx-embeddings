There are currently no confirmed pharmacogenetic interactions between any specific drugs and the CTNNA2 gene, which encodes the alpha catenin protein important for cellular adhesion in neural tissues. However, given CTNNA2's significant role in brain development and conditions such as schizophrenia and autism, its genetic variations might influence the effectiveness or safety of drugs targeting neural adhesion or signaling pathways.
