While the pharmacokinetic interactions between drugs and the KLRC1 gene are not yet established, the gene's role in regulating natural killer (NK) cell function suggests potential pharmacodynamic interactions, particularly with methotrexate. Methotrexate's effectiveness in cancer treatments may vary among individuals with different KLRC1 genotypes, due to its involvement in modulating immune response and NK cell cytotoxic activity against tumor cells.
