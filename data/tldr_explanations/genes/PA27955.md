Variants in the FAAH gene, which is essential for degrading fatty acid amides and influences the endocannabinoid system, can impact the effectiveness and side effects of drugs targeting neurotransmitter pathways such as quetiapine, haloperidol, and oxycodone. These interactions occur because changes in endocannabinoid system dynamics, caused by FAAH genetic variations, can alter the overall balance of neurotransmitters, influencing both therapeutic outcomes and adverse effects profiles of these medications.
