Clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic with immunomodulatory effects, may influence the TRAC gene, which is vital for T cell function, by causing agranulocytosis and affecting immune responses. This interaction is primarily pharmacodynamic, focusing on the effects on immune processes rather than the metabolic or distribution pathways of the drug.
