The drugs acetazolamide and methazolamide, originally used for treating glaucoma, can inhibit CA12, a gene overexpressed in various cancers like renal, colorectal, and breast cancer, which aids in tumor growth and metastasis by affecting pH homeostasis within cancer cells. Similarly, anticonvulsants such as topiramate and zonisamide also inhibit carbonic anhydrases, possibly affecting tumor environments by interacting with CA12, though this isn't their primary use, suggesting potential pharmacokinetic interactions.
