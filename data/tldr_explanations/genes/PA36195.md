Variations in the STIM1 gene, which regulates calcium homeostasis, could potentially affect the efficacy and safety of drugs such as calcium channel blockers by altering calcium signaling, though this interaction is mostly theoretical. The chemotherapy agent cytarabine does not directly interact with STIM1â€™s calcium-regulatory functions; its listing as a possibly interacting drug may stem from indirect effects related to disruptions in calcium-mediated cellular processes, rather than through direct pharmacokinetic mechanisms.
