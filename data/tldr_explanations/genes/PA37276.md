The VASP gene, though not directly targeted by medications, is crucial in monitoring the efficacy of P2Y12 inhibitors like clopidogrel and ticagrelor in cardiovascular treatments, as these drugs affect platelet aggregation observed through changes in the phosphorylation of VASP. While Hydrochlorothiazide does not directly interact with VASP, its impact might be connected to broader vascular responses due to VASP's involvement in vascular functions.
