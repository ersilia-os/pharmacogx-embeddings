The pharmacogenetics of SMN2 in spinal muscular atrophy treatment involves drugs such as Nusinersen and Risdiplam, which modify the splicing of SMN2 pre-mRNA to increase the production of functional SMN protein by promoting exon 7 inclusion. Onasemnogene abeparvovec, however, employs a different approach by introducing a functional SMN1 gene via gene therapy, compensating for the deficient SMN2 function but not directly altering it.
