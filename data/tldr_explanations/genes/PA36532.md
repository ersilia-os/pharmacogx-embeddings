TJP1 influences the pharmacokinetics of drugs like risperidone by potentially affecting the blood-brain barrier's permeability, which is essential for risperidoneâ€™s ability to treat conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Variations in TJP1 could alter risperidone's absorption and effectiveness, as well as its side effect profile, by modifying the amount of the drug that reaches brain tissue.
