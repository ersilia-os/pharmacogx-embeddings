Although there are no specific drugs currently known to directly interact with the gene CD84 (SLAMF5), its significant role in immune cell signaling may influence interactions with immunomodulators or monoclonal antibodies that target cell surface proteins. Variations in CD84 expression might affect the pharmacodynamics of treatments, particularly those targeting the SLAM family of receptors, which could be critical in therapeutic strategies for autoimmune diseases.
