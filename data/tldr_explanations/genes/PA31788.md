Genetic variants of the NRXN3 gene influence the effectiveness of treatments such as citalopram, an SSRI used in psychiatric conditions, through its role in synaptic neurotransmitter dynamics which affects receptor dynamics or synaptic plasticity. This plays a significant part in the variable drug responses observed in disorders like mood disorders, potentially going beyond simple changes in neurotransmitter levels.
