GALNT2, involved in glycosylation and lipid metabolism, does not directly interact with the metabolism or mechanism of action of statins and fibrates, but can influence their therapeutic efficacy indirectly by altering lipid levels in the body. There is no clear pharmacogenetic link between GALNT2 and atenolol, a beta-blocker; any interaction is speculative and would relate to the gene's role in cardiovascular systems, without current supporting evidence.
