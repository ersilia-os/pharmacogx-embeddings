LRP1 may interact with statins due to its role in lipid regulation, though detailed documentation on this interaction lacks. Additionally, LRP1 could indirectly affect the pharmacodynamics of warfarin through its effects on vitamin K metabolism, suggesting that variations in LRP1 could alter responses to warfarin. This underscores the complex and indirect nature of pharmacogenetic interactions involving LRP1 with these drugs.
