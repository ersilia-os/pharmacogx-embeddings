Variations in the MME gene, which encodes the enzyme neprilysin, can significantly affect the pharmacodynamics of neprilysin inhibitors like sacubitril in the drug combination sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto), used to treat heart failure. These genetic differences may influence the effectiveness and safety profile of this treatment by altering the enzyme's ability to degrade natriuretic peptides, affecting cardiovascular health outcomes.
