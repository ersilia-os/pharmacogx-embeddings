Glycyrrhizin, an inhibitor of HMGB1, directly binds to the gene to suppress its cytokine activities, benefiting conditions like sepsis by moderating the inflammatory response. Additionally, small molecule inhibitors are developed to curtail HMGB1's release or block its interactions with receptors such as RAGE, TLR2, and TLR4, mitigating its pro-inflammatory and tumor-promoting effects in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and cancers. These interventions are pharmacodynamic, affecting HMGB1's biological activity.
