The GPX3 gene, responsible for regulating oxidative stress through its encoding of Glutathione Peroxidase 3, indirectly affects how the body responds to antioxidant drugs like N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or Vitamin E. Given GPX3's role in detoxifying peroxides, variations in its expression may alter the efficacy of treatments in diseases linked to oxidative stress, suggesting that GPX3 could serve as a potential biomarker for tailoring antioxidant therapy in such conditions.
