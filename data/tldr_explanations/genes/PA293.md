The drugs celecoxib and rofecoxib are COX-2 inhibitors targeting the PTGS2 enzyme to manage inflammation and pain with fewer gastrointestinal side effects, while genetic variations in PTGS2 can affect their effectiveness and safety. Non-selective NSAIDs like ibuprofen and aspirin interact with both PTGS2 and PTGS1, leading to different anti-inflammatory impacts and side effects, whereas drugs such as oxaliplatin and capecitabine interact with PTGS2 indirectly, influencing inflammation-related cancer treatment outcomes; additionally, drugs like atenolol and prostaglandin I2 interact with PTGS2 through broader cardiovascular and inflammatory response pathways.
