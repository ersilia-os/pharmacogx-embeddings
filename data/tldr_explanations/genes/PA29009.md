GSK3B (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 Beta) influences the efficacy and safety of drugs like lithium, which it inhibits to provide therapeutic effects in bipolar disorder treatment by affecting neurotransmitter pathways and offering neuroprotective effects. In cancer treatments, GSK3B's role in cell proliferation makes it a target for drugs such as paclitaxel, although individual genetic variations could affect this interaction, with methotrexate and antidepressants like fluoxetine and citalopram also potentially interacting with GSK3B in the context of neurotransmitter regulation.
