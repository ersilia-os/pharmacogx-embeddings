The pharmacogenetic interactions between BARD1, a gene involved in DNA repair, and anticancer drugs like docetaxel and carboplatin primarily affect the drugs' efficacy and toxicity. Docetaxel's effectiveness in treating cancers such as breast and ovarian cancer can vary based on BARD1 function, as BARD1 influences cellular responses to microtubule damage. Similarly, the response to carboplatin, which induces apoptosis through DNA adducts, can also be altered by variations in BARD1's activity, affecting treatment outcomes.
