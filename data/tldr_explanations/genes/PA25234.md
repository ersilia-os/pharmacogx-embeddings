Variations in BACH1, a gene involved in managing cellular responses to oxidative stress, may influence the pharmacodynamics of isoniazid and rifampin, drugs used in tuberculosis treatment that induce oxidative stress as a side effect. Depending on an individual's genetic profile related to BACH1, there could be differences in oxidative stress response, impacting the side effect profile and toxicity of these drugs.
