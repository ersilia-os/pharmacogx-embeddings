The gene KCNJ6, which encodes the potassium channel Kir3.2, plays a crucial role in the pharmacodynamic interactions with opioids like fentanyl, remifentanil, methadone, and morphine, primarily by modulating the hyperpolarization of neuronal membranes. This affects the central nervous system's response to these drugs, influencing their analgesic and sedative effects, hence impacting the efficacy, required dosage, and potential adverse effects such as respiratory depression.
