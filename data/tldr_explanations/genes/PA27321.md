In individuals with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS), where mutations in the DHCR7 gene impair cholesterol synthesis, the drug cholic acid does not alter DHCR7 pharmacokinetics but acts therapeutically to bypass the metabolic block. Cholic acid aids in activating alternative pathways for bile acid synthesis, indirectly addressing the cholesterol deficiency caused by the ineffective DHCR7 enzyme.
