SLC22A18, also known as solute carrier family 22 member 18, is involved in the transport of molecules across cell membranes and is expressed in organs like the kidney, which are essential for drug excretion. While it may influence the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized or excreted by these pathways, there is no documented evidence of direct pharmacogenetic interactions with specific drugs. Moreover, its role as a tumor suppressor suggests it could potentially affect the efficacy or toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents, particularly in cancers where it is under-expressed or silenced, but such interactions remain speculative without solid evidence.
