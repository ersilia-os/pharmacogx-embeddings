The enzyme encoded by DHRS9, dehydrogenase/reductase 9, is essential in retinoid metabolism, potentially interacting with drugs that affect vitamin A pathways such as isotretinoin, commonly used in severe acne treatment. Variations in DHRS9 could alter the metabolism of retinoids, impacting the effectiveness and safety of medications aimed at conditions involving abnormal vitamin A levels, like certain skin conditions and cancers, although specific drug interactions linked to this gene require further investigation.
