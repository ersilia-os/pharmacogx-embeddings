Variability in the HRH4 gene can affect the efficacy and safety of H4 receptor antagonists like thioperamide, which is used to manage asthma and allergic reactions. Additionally, HRH4 genetic variability might also influence the therapeutic outcomes of risperidone, an antipsychotic known for dopamine and serotonin receptor activity, through potential non-canonical interactions involving immune and inflammatory pathways.
