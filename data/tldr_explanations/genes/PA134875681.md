While CHST11, or Carbohydrate Sulfotransferase 11, modifies chondroitin sulfate affecting cellular signaling and tissue morphogenesis, there are currently no established drugs or drug classes documented that directly target CHST11. Although it holds potential pharmacogenetic importance in oncology or tissue engineering, any speculation about its impact on drug efficiency remains theoretical without clear pharmacogenetic interactions defined.
