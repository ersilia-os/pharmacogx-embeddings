UGT1A8 plays a crucial role in the metabolism of drugs such as atorvastatin, axitinib, valproic acid, methotrexate, and raloxifene by catalyzing their glucuronidation, leading to the formation of water-soluble glucuronide conjugates that facilitate drug excretion. Variants in the UGT1A8 gene can modify the activity of the enzyme, thereby affecting the concentration, efficacy, and toxicity of these drugs, with notable effects on drugs like irinotecan, where altered metabolism significantly impacts its toxicity profile.
