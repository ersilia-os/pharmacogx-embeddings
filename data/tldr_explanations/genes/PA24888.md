The APOA5 gene significantly impacts the effectiveness of drugs like fenofibrate, which is used to lower triglyceride levels, due to pharmacodynamic interactions influenced by genetic variants like -1131T>C and S19W. These interactions can lead to varied drug responses, affecting efficacy and side effects, and similarly influence the effects of statins and ritonavir, which also interact with lipid metabolism pathways influenced by APOA5.
