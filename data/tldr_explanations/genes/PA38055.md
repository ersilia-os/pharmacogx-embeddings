NELFCD, involved in controlling RNA Polymerase II and thereby regulating gene expression, does not currently have clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions with known drugs. The possible interaction between hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic, and NELFCD remains poorly understood and speculative, lacking solid evidence or a clear biological pathway.
