PLCE1, a gene involved in cellular signaling pathways, indirectly affects the efficacy of drugs like hydrochlorothiazide, used for managing nephrotic syndrome, through pharmacodynamic interactions. Alterations in PLCE1 could modify the drug's effectiveness or the body's response because the gene influences processes integral to disease mechanisms, thus potentially impacting therapeutic outcomes based on a patient's genetic make-up.
