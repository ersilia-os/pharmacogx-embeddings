The gene GBP6, which plays a role in immune response particularly related to interferons, is theorized to affect the pharmacodynamics of drugs like interferons used in treating hepatitis and certain cancers. Although unproven, GBP6's function might alter the effectiveness of such drugs by influencing anti-viral defense mechanisms, suggesting a potential interaction with any therapies targeting or influenced by interferon pathways.
