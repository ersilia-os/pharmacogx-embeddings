Variants in the GGH gene, which is essential in folate metabolism, alter enzyme activity, affecting the pharmacokinetics of antifolate drugs such as methotrexate. These interactions impact drug toxicity and effectiveness, necessitating individualized dosage adjustments to optimize treatment outcomes in cancer and autoimmune diseases. Additionally, it is speculated that GGH could influence other drugs like methylphenidate and pemetrexed, which are also dependent on folate-dependent cellular processes, although these connections are less directly understood.
