USP24 is part of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which is critical for protein degradation and influences how drugs, particularly proteasome inhibitors used in cancer therapy, are metabolized and exert their effects. Although there is no direct link currently established between USP24 and specific drugs, its involvement in this pathway might affect the efficacy and toxicity of these inhibitors, and a potential, albeit unverified, interaction with rosuvastatin suggests USP24 might indirectly impact drug actions through effects on protein stability or cholesterol biosynthesis regulation.
