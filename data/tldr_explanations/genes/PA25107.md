Variants in the ATP2B1 gene, which is involved in calcium regulation in cells, affect the efficacy of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) used to treat hypertension and arrhythmias. Specific polymorphisms in ATP2B1 alter the pharmacodynamics of CCBs, impacting their effectiveness in blocking calcium channels, which is crucial for managing blood pressure and heart rhythm irregularities.
