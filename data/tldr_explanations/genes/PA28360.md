The MTOR gene, which is crucial for regulating cell growth and protein synthesis, has significant pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs like rapamycin and its analog everolimus, which target the mTOR pathway involved in cell proliferation and survival. Variations in the MTOR gene can influence how patients metabolize and respond to these drugs, affecting the efficacy and toxicity of treatments in conditions like cancer and organ transplantation, thus enabling potential personalization of therapy to optimize outcomes.
