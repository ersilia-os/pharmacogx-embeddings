The gene SLC13A1, which encodes a sodium/sulfate symporter, influences the metabolism and excretion of drugs that undergo sulfate conjugation, such as acetaminophen and certain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Variations in SLC13A1 could potentially alter the pharmacokinetic profiles, including the clearance rates, of these drugs, leading to differences in drug efficacy and toxicity based on individual genetic makeup.
