CES2 (Carboxylesterase 2) gene variations affect the metabolism and efficacy of several drugs including irinotecan, dabigatran etexilate, and oseltamivir. In particular, it activates irinotecan into its potent metabolite SN-38, influences the activation of dabigatran etexilate affecting its anticoagulant effects, and modifies the effectiveness of oseltamivir against influenza, ultimately impacting therapeutic outcomes and side effect profiles of these drugs.
