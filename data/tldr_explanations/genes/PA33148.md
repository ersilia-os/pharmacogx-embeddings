Imatinib directly interacts with the PDGFRB gene by inhibiting its tyrosine kinase activity, crucial for proliferative signaling in cancers such as GIST, thereby demonstrating a direct pharmacodynamic effect. Other drugs like leucovorin, fluorouracil, and irinotecan may interact indirectly with PDGFRB by influencing pathways related to cellular proliferation and DNA synthesis. Variants in PDGFRB could alter the efficacy or toxicity of these drugs, underscoring the importance of personalized therapy in cancers involving aberrant PDGFRB signaling.
