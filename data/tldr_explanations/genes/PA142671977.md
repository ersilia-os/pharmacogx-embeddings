Variations in the DHRS7C gene, which plays a role in steroid hormone metabolism primarily in the liver and testes, may influence the metabolism and efficacy of drugs that interact with steroid hormone pathways, such as anti-androgens used in prostate cancer and estrogen modulators used in breast cancer and post-menopausal treatments. If genetic variants alter the enzyme's efficiency, this could affect the pharmacokinetics of these drugs, potentially requiring dosage adjustments to achieve the desired therapeutic effects.
