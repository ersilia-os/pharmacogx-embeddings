DDX58, or RIG-I, interacts with drugs that target viral infections or modulate immune responses, possibly influencing the effectiveness of antiviral therapies and immune-modulating agents through its role in RNA helicase activity and downstream signaling pathways, including NF-ÎºB and IRF3 activation. Due to its involvement in the immune response rather than drug metabolism, pharmacodynamic interactions with DDX58 are more probable than pharmacokinetic interactions.
