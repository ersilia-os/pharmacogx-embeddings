Drugs like alirocumab and evolocumab, which are PCSK9 inhibitors, work by blocking PCSK9's function, allowing the liver to more effectively clear LDL cholesterol. There are also non-pharmacokinetic interactions between PCSK9 and statins such as rosuvastatin and atorvastatin, as well as with lomitapide, which enhance their lipid-lowering effects possibly through mechanisms related to PCSK9's regulation of LDL receptor function.
