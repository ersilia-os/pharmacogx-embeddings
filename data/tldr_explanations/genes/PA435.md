Variations in the TNF gene significantly influence the effectiveness and side effects of TNF inhibitors like infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept, which are used to treat autoimmune diseases by targeting TNF to reduce inflammation. Additionally, TNF gene variants might affect the metabolism or effects of drugs like atorvastatin, mycophenolate mofetil, gemcitabine, and methotrexate, mainly through impacting immune response and inflammation, thereby modifying pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these therapies.
