Tiagabine, an epilepsy drug, is linked to the SLC6A12 gene, which encodes a neurotransmitter transporter protein for GABA and glycine, and variations in this gene can affect how patients respond to the drug in terms of efficacy and side effects. Aspirin, however, does not directly interact with SLC6A12, and any connection is more speculative and likely related to broader systemic effects involving neurotransmitter regulation.
