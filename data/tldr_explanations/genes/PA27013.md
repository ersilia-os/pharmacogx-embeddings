Drugs such as dexamethasone, lenalidomide, thalidomide, and cyclophosphamide may interact with the CTNNB1 gene, which is involved in the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway crucial for cellular proliferation and differentiation in cancer. These interactions can potentially influence the pharmacodynamics of these drugs, affecting their efficacy or toxicity in cancer treatment by modulating immune responses, drug efficacy, and cellular mechanisms like proliferation and apoptosis.
