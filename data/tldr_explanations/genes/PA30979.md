The chemotherapeutic agent vincristine, used in cancer treatment, may interact with the gene MRPL47, which is involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis. Alterations in MRPL47 could potentially affect vincristine's effectiveness and contribute to its side effect of peripheral neuropathy through changes in mitochondrial function, reflecting a pharmacodynamic interaction rather than pharmacokinetic.
