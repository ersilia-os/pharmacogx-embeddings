Aspirin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), reduces prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting cyclooxygenase enzymes, indirectly affecting the activity of PTGER3 by lowering the availability of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). This interaction alters PTGER3-mediated inflammatory responses and pain perception, thereby impacting the efficacy and therapeutic outcomes of NSAIDs like aspirin in managing pain and inflammation.
