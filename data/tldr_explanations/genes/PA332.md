The gene SLC22A4, which encodes an organic cation transporter, plays a critical role in the transport and effectiveness of drugs like methotrexate, used in treating rheumatoid arthritis and cancer, by affecting its absorption and elimination based on genetic variants of the gene. Additionally, this gene is involved in the cellular uptake and distribution of other medications such as imatinib and gabapentin, thus impacting their availability and effectiveness in cancer therapy and neuropathic pain management, respectively.
