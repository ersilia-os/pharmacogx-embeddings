Although DCAF4 is involved in crucial cellular processes including DNA repair and potential cancer progression, there are no documented pharmacogenetic interactions between DCAF4 and any specific drugs affecting their pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. It is hypothesized that DCAF4 could potentially influence the effectiveness of proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib used in cancer treatment, but there is no concrete evidence to support this interaction.
