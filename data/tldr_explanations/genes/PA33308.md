Alpelisib, an inhibitor targeting the PIK3CA gene, shows increased effectiveness in breast cancer patients with PIK3CA mutations, demonstrating a significant pharmacodynamic interaction that leverages the enhanced PI3K signaling from these mutations. Other chemotherapy drugs like docetaxel, oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and carboplatin may also see variations in efficacy in cancers with PIK3CA mutations due to influences on tumor behavior and cell survival pathways, although direct interactions with PIK3CA are not explicitly established.
