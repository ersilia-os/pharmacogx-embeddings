CYP8B1, a gene involved in bile acid synthesis, indirectly affects the pharmacokinetics of fat-soluble drugs by altering bile acid composition and thus the solubility and absorption of these medications. Although CYP8B1 does not directly interact with the metabolism of these drugs, its effect on the absorption of lipid-soluble substances, such as certain vitamins and antiepileptic drugs, can significantly influence their bioavailability, necessitating dosage adjustments in individuals with variations in this gene.
