Carglumic acid interacts with the NAGS gene by acting as a substitute for N-acetylglutamate, compensating for reduced NAGS function and treating hyperammonemia by activating carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1, while glycerol phenylbutyrate aids in ammonia reduction in urea cycle disorders like NAGS deficiency by forming phenylacetylglutamine, although it does not directly influence the NAGS mutation. Both drugs work by modulating enzymatic activities and metabolic pathways affected by NAGS mutations.
