Variants in the ATP1A2 gene, which are associated with familial hemiplegic migraine type 2, may impact the effectiveness or safety of drugs commonly used in migraine treatment, such as triptans and anti-epileptic drugs, due to the gene's role in neural excitability. Additionally, olanzapine may exhibit altered effects in patients with these genetic variants, primarily affecting neurological side effects rather than direct pharmacokinetic interactions.
