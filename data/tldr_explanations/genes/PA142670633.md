The gene VAC14 plays a critical role in neuronal function by regulating PI(3,5)P2, and although direct interactions with common drugs are uncharted, its significance in neurodegenerative conditions suggests potential indirect pharmacogenetic interactions, particularly with the chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel. Docetaxel, which inhibits microtubule depolymerization and thus impacts cell division, may influence VAC14-related cellular processes, potentially affecting neuronal survival and morphology, indicating a complex, albeit speculated, pharmacodynamic relationship.
