SLC18A2, which codes for VMAT2, plays a key role in neurotransmitter transport into synaptic vesicles, and its pharmacogenetic significance becomes apparent with drugs affecting the central nervous system. Reserpine and tetrabenazine, both VMAT2 inhibitors, reduce monoamine neurotransmitter stores and vary in efficacy and side effects based on different SLC18A2 gene variants.
