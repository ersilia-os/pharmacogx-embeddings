TLR9 agonists like CpG oligodeoxynucleotides directly activate the TLR9 signaling pathway, enhancing cytokine and interferon production, which are crucial for immune response, especially in cancer immunotherapy and vaccine adjuvants. Conversely, tacrolimus, an immunosuppressive drug, does not interact directly with TLR9 but may indirectly affect TLR9-mediated immune responses by inhibiting calcineurin, thus reducing T-cell activity and potentially modulating immune functions involved in TLR9 pathways.
