HTR3B influences the function of the type 3 serotonin receptor and its interactions with drugs like ondansetron, granisetron, and paroxetine by modifying receptor activity, which affects the drugsâ€™ efficacy and side effects. Variations in HTR3B result in differences in how these drugs work, as they either block serotonin from binding to receptors or alter receptor function to impact serotonin levels, emphasizing a pharmacodynamic interaction rather than impacting drug pharmacokinetics.
