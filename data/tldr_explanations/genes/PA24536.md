ADAMTS1, which is involved in proteolysis and degradation of the extracellular matrix, may indirectly influence the efficacy of drugs like pravastatin used in oncology and cardiovascular therapies due to its roles in inflammation and extracellular matrix dynamics. Although ADAMTS1 does not directly affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of pravastatin, its biological functions could impact drug outcomes in diseases related to extracellular matrix remodeling or inflammation.
