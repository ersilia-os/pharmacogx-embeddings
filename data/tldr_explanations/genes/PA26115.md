Mutations in the CBL gene, which encodes for an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, influence the efficacy and toxicity of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib by affecting the ubiquitination and degradation of targets like the BCR-ABL oncogene used in treating chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Additionally, CBLâ€™s interactions may impact the effectiveness of azacitidine, used in myelodysplastic syndromes, potentially through pathways involving apoptosis and cell cycle regulation, influenced by signaling pathways like RAS and PI3K-AKT.
