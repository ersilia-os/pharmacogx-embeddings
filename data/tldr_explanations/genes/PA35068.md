HLA-DQB1 gene variants significantly impact drug hypersensitivity reactions, particularly for drugs like abacavir, allopurinol, nevirapine, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine, which can cause severe reactions such as Steven-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis in genetically predisposed individuals. These interactions emphasize the role of HLA-DQB1 in pharmacodynamics, affecting drug safety and efficacy rather than drug metabolism.
