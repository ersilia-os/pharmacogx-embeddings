NR1H2, a gene encoding for Liver X receptor beta (LXRÎ²), is involved in the pharmacogenetics of metabolic and inflammatory diseases and interacts with the cancer therapy drug gefitinib, which mainly targets EGFR tyrosine kinase. Although NR1H2 primarily affects the transcriptional regulation of metabolic genes, its role in hepatic metabolism suggests that it could influence the pharmacokinetics of gefitinib, potentially altering the drug's metabolism or disposition.
