HLA-DRB5 affects the pharmacogenetics of clavulanate, amoxicillin, and clozapine by modulating immune responses rather than altering drug metabolism or transport. In the cases of clavulanate and amoxicillin, this can lead to hypersensitivity reactions, while for clozapine, it can influence the risk of agranulocytosis, all due to variations in HLA-DRB5 that affect the immune system's reaction to these drugs.
