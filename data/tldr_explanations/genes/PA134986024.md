Although there is not a well-characterized direct pharmacogenetic interaction between drugs and POLR3G, indirect effects suggested in the context of nevirapine treatment for HIV may influence treatment efficacy. These effects are thought to stem from alterations in POLR3G potentially affecting the transcription of cellular components involved in viral infection or pathways related to drug metabolism or toxicity, thus indirectly impacting cellular kinetics during therapy.
