RALBP1, which interacts with the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1), affects the pharmacokinetics of chemotherapeutic agents like vincristine and doxorubicin by modulating drug efflux, thereby altering drug concentration and efficacy in cancer treatments. Although not directly evidenced in literature, RALBP1 may also affect the effects of drugs like leucovorin, fluorouracil, and irinotecan, potentially through related pathways involving drug transport and cellular uptake, impacting their pharmacokinetics and resistance in tumor cells.
