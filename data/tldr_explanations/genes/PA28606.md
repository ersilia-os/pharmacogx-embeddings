Variations in the GCG gene, responsible for encoding glucagon, can influence the efficacy of glucagon injections used to treat hypoglycemia by affecting how the drug elevates blood glucose levels (pharmacodynamics) and possibly its metabolism (pharmacokinetics). Additionally, antipsychotic drugs like olanzapine and clozapine might impact blood glucose control, potentially requiring adjustments in glucagon treatment strategies due to their influence on the body's response to glucagon, although the exact interactions are not fully detailed.
