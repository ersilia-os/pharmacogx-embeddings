UGGT2, involved in protein quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum, does not directly interact with drugs like hydrochlorothiazide but may indirectly affect drug metabolism by influencing cellular responses to ER stress and protein handling. While no direct pharmacokinetic interactions are reported with this gene, its function could theoretically affect responses to medications impacting these cellular mechanisms.
