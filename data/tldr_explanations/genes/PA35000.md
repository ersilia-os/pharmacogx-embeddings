SCN10A, which encodes the NaV1.8 sodium channel involved in pain perception, influences the pharmacodynamics of sodium channel blockers like lidocaine used for pain relief; individual genetic variations in SCN10A can lead to different levels of effectiveness in these drugs. Although carboplatin does not directly target sodium channels, variations in SCN10A might indirectly affect how this chemotherapeutic agent induces peripheral neuropathy by altering neuronal sensitivity.
