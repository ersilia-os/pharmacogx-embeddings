VPS13D, which is involved in autophagy and mitochondrial functionality, may influence the efficacy or toxicity of the cancer treatment drug capecitabine, a prodrug that requires metabolic activation. Though the interaction is non-pharmacokinetic and not well established with clinical data, VPS13D could potentially affect capecitabine by altering cellular uptake, distribution of metabolites, or impacting cellular pathways, such as those related to stress responses and mitochondrial functions.
