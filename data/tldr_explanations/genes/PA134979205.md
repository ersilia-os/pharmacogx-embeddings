MBOAT1, crucial in ghrelin acylation and therefore appetite stimulation and energy balance, could be interacted with by drugs targeting metabolic or appetite control pathways, either influencing its expression or enzymatic activity. Particularly, this interaction might involve medications influencing ghrelin or those affecting similar metabolic processes, such as weight management or anti-obesity drugs, and potentially extends to drugs targeting lipid enzymes, affecting MBOAT1's function or efficiency.
