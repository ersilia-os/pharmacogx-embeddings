The gene SLC22A17, which facilitates iron transport, could potentially interact with the drugs doxorubicin and daunorubicin, which resemble siderophores and are used in chemotherapy and antibiotic treatments. This interaction might enable these drugs to use SLC22A17's transport pathways, potentially enhancing their cellular uptake and efficacy in iron-rich tissues through a mechanism that mimics natural siderophore transport.
