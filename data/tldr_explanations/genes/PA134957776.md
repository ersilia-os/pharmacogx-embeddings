PSMD14, part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, indirectly interacts with proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, carfilzomib, and ixazomib, commonly used in treating diseases like multiple myeloma. Variations in PSMD14 function might influence the effectiveness of these drugs, underscoring the importance of genetic insights for optimizing treatment outcomes. In contrast, there is no documented pharmacogenetic interaction between PSMD14 and the antipsychotic medication risperidone.
