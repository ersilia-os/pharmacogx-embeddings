Triamcinolone, a corticosteroid used in treating immune-related conditions, may interact pharmacodynamically with the long non-coding RNA gene HCG22, located within the HLA complex. This interaction potentially influences gene expression patterns linked to immune functions or inflammatory processes, leading to variations in drug efficacy and individual treatment responses.
