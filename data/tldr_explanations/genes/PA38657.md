GLCCI1, a gene involved in glucocorticoid signaling, affects the effectiveness of glucocorticoids like budesonide, fluticasone propionate, triamcinolone, and dexamethasone in treating asthma by influencing how these drugs activate anti-inflammatory processes. Variants in the GLCCI1 gene can lead to reduced efficacy of these medications, impacting the pharmacodynamic interaction (how the drug works in the body), rather than the pharmacokinetics (how the body processes the drug).
