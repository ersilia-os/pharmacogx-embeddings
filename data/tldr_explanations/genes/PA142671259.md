The gene NOS1AP affects cardiac electrophysiology by influencing the QT interval, impacting the effectiveness and risks of drugs like amiodarone and sotalol used in arrhythmia management, due to its role in altering cardiac repolarization intervals. Additionally, variations in NOS1AP may modify the cardiovascular effects and risk profiles of other drugs such as glimepiride, repaglinide, glyburide, glipizide, dolasetron, granisetron, digoxin, and verapamil, though interactions are more complex and deal more with dynamic cardiovascular responses rather than direct enzymatic metabolism.
