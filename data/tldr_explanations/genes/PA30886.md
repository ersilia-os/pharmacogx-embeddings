MMP3, a gene involved in tissue remodeling and inflammation, interacts with cardiovascular drugs like chlorthalidone, lisinopril, and pravastatin, affecting their efficacy in managing hypertension and hyperlipidemia. This interaction, primarily pharmacodynamic rather than pharmacokinetic, is due to MMP3's influence on vascular health and integrity, leading to variability in drug effectiveness in reducing cardiovascular risks and managing blood pressure.
