HLA-DRB3, a gene involved in immune system response, interacts with drugs not by being directly targeted but by influencing how the immune system interacts with these drugs, thus modulating their effects and potentially leading to drug hypersensitivity reactions. For example, variations in HLA-DRB3 are linked to different responses and adverse reactions to drugs like clozapine, where a connection is suggested between HLA alleles and clozapine-induced agranulocytosis, highlighting the gene's role in drug efficacy and safety.
