Certain anticancer drugs, when used in combination, have interactions that target ERBB2 (HER2) and enhance therapeutic efficacy against HER2-positive cancers. Trastuzumab and pertuzumab synergize by inhibiting ERBB2 signaling and preventing receptor dimerization, respectively, while lapatinib blocks the kinase activities of HER2 and EGFR. Additionally, drugs like docetaxel, tucatinib, and everolimus work together by fostering apoptosis, selectively inhibiting HER2, or targeting downstream pathways influenced by ERBB2, thereby establishing a pharmacodynamic relationship with the ERBB2 gene, crucial for effective treatment strategies in resistant cancer types.
