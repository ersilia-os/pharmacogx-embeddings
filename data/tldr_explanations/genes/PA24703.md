Although no specific drugs are known to directly interact with ALDH6A1, an enzyme involved in amino acid metabolism, variations in ALDH6A1 activity could indirectly influence the metabolism of drugs that depend on acetyl-CoA or propionyl-CoA. These drugs are primarily metabolized in the liver and kidneys, where ALDH6A1 is significantly expressed, potentially affecting drug efficacy or toxicity due to altered pharmacokinetics in these pathways.
