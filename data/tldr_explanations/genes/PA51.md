Variants in the APOC1 gene affect the efficacy of drugs such as atorvastatin and fenofibrate, which are involved in lipid metabolism, by modifying how these drugs interact with lipid-regulating mechanisms. These interactions, particularly with atorvastatin, are primarily pharmacodynamic rather than pharmacokinetic. The gene also potentially influences the secondary lipid-related effects of ritonavir and the pharmacodynamics of warfarin through shared metabolic pathways.
