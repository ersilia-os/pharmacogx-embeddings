The gene AQP1 plays a critical role in water management and cell migration, influencing the outcomes of treatments for conditions like glaucoma, stroke, and tumors due to its regulation of water flow across cell membranes. While specific drugs that directly interact with AQP1 are not established, the gene's function implies its potential impact on drugs targeting fluid regulation and cellular migration, suggesting that modulating AQP1 activity could help manage fluid-related pathologies by controlling cellular water transport.
