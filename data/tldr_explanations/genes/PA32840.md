Sodium phenylbutyrate and glycerol phenylbutyrate help in the treatment of OTC deficiency by promoting the excretion of nitrogen waste through alternative pathways, while their effectiveness can vary based on the specific mutations in the OTC gene affecting residual enzymatic activity. In contrast, valproic acid can worsen hyperammonemia in OTC deficiency patients by inhibiting key functions in the urea cycle, highlighting the necessity of adjusting its use depending on the patientâ€™s genetic profile.
