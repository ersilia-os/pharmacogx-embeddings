The gene ADORA2A-AS1, encoding the antisense RNA of ADORA2A, indirectly influences the effectiveness of drugs targeting the adenosine A2a receptor by modulating the receptor's expression. Among these, caffeine, an antagonist of the A2a receptor, can have altered stimulatory effects due to changes in ADORA2A expression mediated by ADORA2A-AS1, while the connection between ADORA2A-AS1 and methotrexate's effects is less certain and speculative.
