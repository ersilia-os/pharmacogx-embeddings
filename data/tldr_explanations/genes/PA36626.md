Variations in the CD40LG gene, which encodes the CD40 ligand, influence the effectiveness and safety of drugs that inhibit the CD40L-CD40 interaction, such as those used in treating autoimmune diseases and preventing transplant rejection. These pharmacogenetic interactions primarily affect the pharmacodynamics of the drugs, modifying how they impact the immune system's functionality rather than altering their pharmacokinetics.
