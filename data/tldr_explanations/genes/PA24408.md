ABCG1, a gene involved in lipid metabolism, impacts the effectiveness of statins, drugs targeting cholesterol levels, due to its role in cholesterol and phospholipid transport. Its potential influence on chemotherapeutic drugs like leucovorin, paclitaxel, fluorouracil, and irinotecan may involve indirect interactions related to cellular lipid environments, indicating a broader pharmacogenetic role than just lipid-lowering.
