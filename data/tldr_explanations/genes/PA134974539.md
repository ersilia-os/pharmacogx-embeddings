DHRS7, through its role in reducing ketones and aldehydes to alcohols using NADP+/NADPH, may affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs like certain corticosteroids and isotretinoin, which undergo reductive metabolism involving similar substrates. This could impact drug efficacy and safety by altering how these drugs are metabolized, potentially changing their active or inactive forms.
