Hydrochlorothiazide, enalapril, and atenolol, drugs used for treating cardiovascular diseases, may interact with the gene PRKCA primarily through pharmacodynamic mechanisms. These interactions could affect drug efficacy and involve PRKCA's role in cell signaling pathways like ion transport, angiotensin II regulation, and adrenergic signaling, highlighting its significance in personalized medicine for conditions such as hypertension.
