Variants in the DGKB gene, which plays a significant role in diacylglycerol metabolism and impacts signaling pathways crucial for growth and insulin regulation, might influence how patients metabolize or respond to antidiabetic medications like metformin or sulfonylureas. Further, DGKB's involvement in lipid signaling could affect the efficacy of lipid-modifying drugs such as statins, indicating potential pharmacodynamic interactions that relate to the effects of these drugs rather than their pharmacokinetic profiles.
