Methotrexate and pemetrexed are antifolate agents that interact with the ATIC gene involved in purine biosynthesis, affecting drug efficacy and toxicity. Genetic polymorphisms in ATIC can influence treatment outcomes by altering enzyme activity, which impacts the pharmacodynamics of these drugs, necessitating genotype-based dosage adjustments to optimize efficacy and minimize toxicity in treatments such as rheumatoid arthritis and leukemia.
