Variants of the APOB gene, which is crucial for lipid metabolism, affect the pharmacodynamics of statins like simvastatin and atorvastatin, thereby influencing their effectiveness in reducing LDL cholesterol levels. Additionally, interactions of APOB with other lipid-modifying drugs such as PCSK9 inhibitors and fibrates, as well as with irbesartan, a blood pressure medication, can affect drug efficacy and metabolism, largely due to shared hepatic pathways.
