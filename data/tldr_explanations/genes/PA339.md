Fentanyl and esomeprazole do not directly interact with the STAT6 gene in a well-established pharmacogenetic manner; however, there might be an indirect relationship due to STAT6's role in regulating immune responses, which could affect the pharmacodynamics of fentanyl in immune-modulated stress responses and esomeprazole in inflammation-related acid secretion. The direct pharmacogenetic interactions of these drugs with STAT6 remain speculative and lack strong clinical evidence.
