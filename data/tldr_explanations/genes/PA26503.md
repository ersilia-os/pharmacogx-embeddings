The interactions between the gene CHST3 and drugs like docetaxel and thalidomide primarily relate to the potential pharmacodynamic effects stemming from CHST3's role in modifying the extracellular matrix, rather than direct pharmacokinetic interactions. Alterations in CHST3 activity could conceivably affect the distribution and effectiveness of these drugs in tissues that are rich in chondroitin sulfate, such as cartilage, possibly impacting drug efficacy and side-effect profiles by changing tissue structure and integrity.
