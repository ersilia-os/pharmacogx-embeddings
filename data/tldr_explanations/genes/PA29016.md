GSTA1 (Glutathione S-transferase alpha 1) plays a key role in the metabolism and detoxification of drugs like busulfan and cyclophosphamide through its enzyme activity, which involves conjugating reduced glutathione with various electrophilic compounds. Variations in the GSTA1 gene can affect the efficacy and toxicity of these drugs by altering their metabolism, and this gene may also influence the response to other drugs such as prednisone, doxorubicin, and vincristine, possibly through mechanisms related to oxidative stress modulation.
