The gene PYROXD2, involved in oxidative protein folding and cellular redox balance, has a theorized but not well-documented interaction with methylphenidate, a stimulant commonly used for treating ADHD. This interaction is considered non-pharmacokinetic, potentially affecting methylphenidate's efficacy or safety by influencing cellular oxidative states, although current evidence for this relationship is speculative and requires further investigation.
