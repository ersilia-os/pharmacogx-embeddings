The gene TBC1D1, which plays a key role in insulin and glucose signaling, doesn't directly interact with specific drugs but may influence the pharmacodynamics of antidiabetic treatments indirectly due to its involvement in GLUT4 translocation. Additionally, antipsychotic drugs such as olanzapine and clozapine, known to alter metabolic profiles, might have indirect interactions with TBC1D1 pathways by affecting insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake, which could modify the drugs' metabolic side effects and impact treatment outcomes in patients prone to metabolic issues.
