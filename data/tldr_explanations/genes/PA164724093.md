Variations in the NOS2 gene, which plays a critical role in the production of nitric oxide, can affect the efficacy and side effects of isoniazid and rifampin, key anti-tuberculosis drugs. These drugs interact with the nitric oxide pathway, influenced by NOS2, impacting immune and inflammatory responses that are central to their effectiveness and safety in treating tuberculosis.
