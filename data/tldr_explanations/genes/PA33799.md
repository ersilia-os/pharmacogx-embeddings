Phenprocoumon and warfarin, both vitamin K antagonists used in managing thrombotic disorders, interact with the PROC gene, affecting protein C levels and necessitating cautious administration and genetic testing to avoid adverse effects like warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Additionally, drugs like lusutrombopag and avatrombopag used for thrombocytopenia in chronic liver disease also interact with PROC, influencing thrombin modulation and clot formation, which impacts the pharmacodynamics of these treatments.
