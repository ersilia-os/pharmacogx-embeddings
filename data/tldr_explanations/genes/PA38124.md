GALNT17, involved in protein glycosylation, may influence the efficacy and side effects of montelukast, a drug used for asthma, by potentially modifying its pharmacodynamics through altered glycosylation patterns of protein targets. Although direct evidence is lacking, variations in GALNT17 could affect how montelukast interacts with its targets, impacting its overall effectiveness and safety.
