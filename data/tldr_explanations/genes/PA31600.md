Glucocorticoids affect NFKB2's transcriptional activity by promoting IκB synthesis, indirectly modulating NF-kappa B activity, while proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib and IKK inhibitors stabilize IκB, leading to reduced NF-kappa B activity. These drugs alter the pharmacodynamics by impacting the NF-kappa B signaling pathway interactions with NFKB2, with varying effects dependent on genetic variations in the NFKB2 gene.
