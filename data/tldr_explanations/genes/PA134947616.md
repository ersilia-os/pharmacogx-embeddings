EIF2AK4, mainly involved in cellular stress responses, does not engage in pharmacokinetic interactions but may interact pharmacodynamically with antipsychotics like haloperidol, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, and ziprasidone. These interactions are thought to occur via modulation of cellular responses to oxidative or inflammatory stress induced by antipsychotics, affecting drug efficacy or contributing to side effects related to cellular stress.
