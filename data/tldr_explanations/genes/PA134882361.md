The REEP5 gene, which plays a role in receptor expression and neurotransmitter function, might significantly influence the efficacy of SSRIs like fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, and citalopram through potential variations in receptor availability or function, affecting how these drugs interact with serotonin signaling pathways. This interaction suggests that genetic variations in REEP5 could alter the therapeutic outcomes of these medications, though direct pharmacogenetic evidence is yet to be established.
