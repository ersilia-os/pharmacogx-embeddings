The gene SLC22A3, or OCT3, influences the pharmacokinetics of drugs like metformin and potentially antidepressants like citalopram by affecting their cellular uptake and distribution. Variants in SLC22A3 can lead to altered drug efficiency and side effect profiles by impacting the transporter efficiency and thus the intracellular concentrations of these medications.
