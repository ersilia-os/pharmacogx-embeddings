The gene ALDH1L1, which plays a key role in folate metabolism, could affect the efficacy or toxicity of folate-modulating drugs like methotrexate by influencing folate availability, thus altering drug dynamics. Although the connection of ALDH1L1 with methylphenidate lacks direct evidence, it is speculated that variations in ALDH1L1 may impact drug responses in neurological conditions due to its significant expression in the central nervous system and potential modulation of neurochemical pathways.
