Drugs such as vemurafenib, dabrafenib, and encorafenib target and inhibit the mutated BRAF protein in cancers like melanoma by blocking its kinase activity, thereby reducing tumor growth. Additionally, MEK inhibitors like trametinib, cobimetinib, and binimetinib, which target downstream components in the same pathway, are used in conjunction with BRAF inhibitors to enhance effectiveness and counteract resistance, while chloroquine may interact through a different mechanism involving autophagy inhibition.
