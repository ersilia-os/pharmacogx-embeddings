The gene PPARGC1A significantly impacts the pharmacological efficacy of the drug rosiglitazone, a Thiazolidinedione used to treat type 2 diabetes, by influencing insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism through mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Variations in the PPARGC1A gene expression or polymorphisms can lead to different therapeutic outcomes of rosiglitazone, demonstrating a pharmacodynamic interaction where the gene's role in energy metabolism affects the drug's effectiveness.
