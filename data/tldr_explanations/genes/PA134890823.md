Drugs like idelalisib, copanlisib, and sorafenib, which target the PI3K/AKT pathway, could be affected by variations in the PIK3R5 gene that influences this signaling pathway. Variants in PIK3R5 might alter the efficacy or toxicity of these inhibitors, thereby impacting their pharmacodynamic interactions and therapeutic outcomes.
