Drugs like 3-hydroxycotinine and nicotine interact with the gene EGLN2, which plays a significant role in the cellular response to hypoxia. 3-hydroxycotinine may affect drug metabolism or clearance through its influence on oxygen-sensing pathways moderated by EGLN2, while nicotine can indirectly engage EGLN2 to impact pharmacodynamic responses related to cellular adaptation to low oxygen levels.
