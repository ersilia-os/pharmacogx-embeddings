IGF2BP2, a gene associated with type 2 diabetes, influences the effectiveness of antidiabetic drugs such as metformin and repaglinide through pharmacodynamic interactions, where gene variants affect how these drugs impact metabolism. Additionally, IGF2BP2 potentially affects the response to cancer drugs like oxaliplatin, epirubicin, and fluorouracil through non-pharmacokinetic interactions, possibly altering cancer cell sensitivity by influencing mRNA stability and translation related to cell growth pathways.
