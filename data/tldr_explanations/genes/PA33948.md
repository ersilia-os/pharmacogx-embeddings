PTGES, critical in synthesizing prostaglandin E2, interacts with NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and aspirin and the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, which interfere with prostaglandin pathways by inhibiting cyclooxygenase enzymes, reducing substrates available for PTGES and thus prostaglandin E2 synthesis. This interaction modulates inflammation and pain, with celecoxib offering a more targeted inhibition due to its selective action on COX-2, impacting PGE2 synthesis similarly but more specifically compared to non-selective NSAIDs.
