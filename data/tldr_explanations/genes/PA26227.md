CD58, which facilitates cell adhesion and communication between immune cells, may influence the efficacy of immunomodulatory treatments for autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis through its interactions with CD2. Variations in CD58 expression or function could affect therapies that target T-cell activation or NK cell functions, suggesting the importance of considering CD58's genetic variations to potentially enhance therapeutic outcomes by tailoring treatments that modulate the CD58-CD2 interaction.
