Duloxetine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, potentially interacts with ANO2, a gene encoding a calcium-activated chloride channel involved in sensory perception and pain pathways. This interaction, primarily pharmacodynamic rather than pharmacokinetic, may affect ANO2 activity indirectly through neurotransmitter pathways and could influence treatment approaches for sensory-related disorders and pain management.
