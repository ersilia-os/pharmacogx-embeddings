ACHE interacts with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors like Donepezil, Rivastigmine, and Pyridostigmine, used in treating Alzheimerâ€™s disease and Myasthenia Gravis by enhancing acetylcholine levels and improving neurotransmission. Genetic variations in ACHE affect the efficacy and safety of these medications, potentially altering dosage needs and increasing the risk of side effects, highlighting the importance of genetic testing in treatment personalization.
