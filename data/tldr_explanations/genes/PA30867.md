Variations in the MMP1 gene, such as the 1G/2G promoter polymorphism, influence the efficacy and side effect profiles of MMP inhibitors like marimastat, which are used to prevent tumor growth and metastasis in cancer therapy by inhibiting the breakdown of collagen in the extracellular matrix. These genetic polymorphisms affect both the pharmacodynamics of the drug related to MMP1 activity and potentially the pharmacokinetics through interactions with proteins involved in drug metabolism and clearance.
