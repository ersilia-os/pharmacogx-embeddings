The NPC1L1 gene affects the efficacy of the cholesterol-lowering drug ezetimibe by influencing how cholesterol is absorbed from the intestines. Genetic variations in NPC1L1 can lead to different responses to ezetimibe, impacting the drugâ€™s effectiveness in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), which is vital for personalized treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Conversely, the interaction of NPC1L1 with pravastatin does not show significant pharmacogenetic relevance.
