IKBKB, which plays a crucial role in the NF-kappa B signaling pathway, influences the effectiveness and safety of gefitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in non-small cell lung cancer therapy. Although not directly involved in gefitinib's primary action, IKBKB may affect tumor response and resistance through its modulation of the NF-kappaB pathway, which indirectly alters how cancer cells respond to the drug's effects.
