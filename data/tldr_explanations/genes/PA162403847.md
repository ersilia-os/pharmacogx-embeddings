Variability in the SLC47A2 gene, which affects the function of the MATE2 protein involved in drug excretion in the kidneys, influences the renal clearance of the antidiabetic drug metformin, impacting its effectiveness and safety. Genetic differences in SLC47A2 can lead to reduced excretion of metformin, increasing the risk of side effects like lactic acidosis, and potentially affect the pharmacokinetics of other drugs like cimetidine and procainamide through similar mechanisms.
