EPHX1, or Epoxide Hydrolase 1, is a key enzyme in the metabolism of several drugs, including carbamazepine and phenprocoumon, affecting their therapeutic levels and side effects. It also influences the effectiveness and toxicity of other drugs like docetaxel, acetylcysteine, warfarin, phenytoin, and cyclophosphamide, by impacting their metabolism and detoxification processes, which can alter therapeutic outcomes based on genetic variations.
