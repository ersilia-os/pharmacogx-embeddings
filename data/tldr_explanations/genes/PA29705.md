The gene IGFBP3, by regulating the bioactivity of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), influences the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs such as fluorouracil. Variants in IGFBP3 can modify the IGF signaling pathways, which are essential for the processes of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis that are induced by fluorouracil, thereby affecting the drug's effectiveness in cancer treatment.
