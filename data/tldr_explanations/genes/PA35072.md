The HLA-DRB1 gene, through its various alleles, significantly influences the pharmacogenetic interactions that affect the efficacy and safety of medications, causing immune-mediated hypersensitivity reactions. For instance, the HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele is linked to abacavir hypersensitivity in HIV treatment, while HLA-DRB1*07:01 is associated with hepatic injuries from ximelagatran, highlighting the importance of understanding a patient's HLA-DRB1 allele status to optimize and personalize treatment strategies.
