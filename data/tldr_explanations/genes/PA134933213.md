SENP3, a gene involved in the SUMOylation process important for cell cycle control and apoptosis, particularly in cancer, does not interact directly with drugs like methylphenidate pharmacokinetically. However, its role in pharmacodynamics is significant as it may influence response to drugs targeting cellular pathways possibly affected by SENP3 activities, such as those undergoing post-translational modifications like SUMOylation, key in neurotransmitter pathwaysâ€”a potential indirect pharmacogenetic effect of SENP3.
