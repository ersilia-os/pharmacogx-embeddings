Drugs such as desmopressin, a synthetic vasopressin analogue, directly interact with the AQP2 gene by depending on its protein function for efficacy in conditions like diabetes insipidus. Additionally, thiazide diuretics and NSAIDs affect water reabsorption indirectly by influencing AQP2 activity through mechanisms like altering filtrate flow rate and renal blood flow, thus impacting the gene's pharmacodynamic landscape.
