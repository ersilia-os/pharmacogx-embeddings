The gene SPTA1, responsible for an integral part of red blood cellsâ€™ structure, does not have well-documented direct interactions with drugs such as benazepril. The drug connections more likely stem from treating overlapping conditions like hypertension in patients who have SPTA1 mutations and related anemias rather than a specific pharmacogenetic interaction.
