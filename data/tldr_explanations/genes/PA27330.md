DHRSX, a gene involved in oxidation-reduction processes on the X chromosome, potentially affects the metabolism of drugs processed through similar pathways, potentially altering drug efficacy and toxicity. However, any pharmacogenetic interactions involving DHRSX remain speculative as there is no direct evidence linking it to specific drugs, and its exact mechanism of influencing drug metabolism is unclear.
