The gene C12orf43 has no well-documented pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs, including ribavirin, and its function remains unclear. Potential interactions with ribavirin are speculated to be pharmacodynamic, but there is no current evidence supporting any specific role of C12orf43 in drug metabolism or pharmacodynamics.
