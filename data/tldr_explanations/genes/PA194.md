Variants of the HTR2C gene, which encodes the serotonin receptor 2C, influence the pharmacodynamic interactions and side effect profiles of psychiatric drugs such as olanzapine, clozapine, risperidone, aripiprazole, and ziprasidone, leading to differences in drug efficacy and tolerability. Specific HTR2C polymorphisms are associated with significant side effects like weight gain and metabolic issues in drugs like olanzapine and clozapine, necessitating personalized treatment adjustments for patients.
