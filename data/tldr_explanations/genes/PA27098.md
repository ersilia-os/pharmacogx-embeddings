Drugs like talarozole and R115866 inhibit the CYP26A1 enzyme, which is involved in the metabolism of retinoic acid, and are used experimentally to increase retinoic acid levels and enhance the efficacy of retinoid therapies. These inhibitors prevent the breakdown of retinoic acid, thus potentiating its effects, which is beneficial in treating conditions where retinoic acid signaling is crucial, such as certain dermatological and oncological disorders.
