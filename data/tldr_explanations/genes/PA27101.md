CYP2A13, a cytochrome P450 enzyme primarily found in the respiratory tract, plays a significant role in activating procarcinogens in tobacco smoke, such as nitrosamines, impacting lung cancer risk among smokers. Although it does not metabolize nicotine directly, CYP2A13 affects the activation of other smoke components that interact with nicotine's pathway, potentially influencing nicotine addiction and cancer risks, with genetic variations in CYP2A13 altering susceptibility to these effects.
