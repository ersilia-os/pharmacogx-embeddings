Tegafur and capecitabine, prodrugs of fluorouracil used in colorectal cancer treatment, and aspirin, used for its anti-inflammatory properties, could have their therapeutic outcomes influenced by SMAD7, which inhibits the TGF-beta signaling pathway involved in cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammatory processes. Although these drugs do not directly interact with the metabolic pathways of SMAD7, the gene's modulation of TGF-beta responses could indirectly affect the drugs' efficacy in diseases like colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease.
