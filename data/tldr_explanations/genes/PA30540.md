The gene MAFK, which regulates the NRF2 pathway, influences the metabolism of drugs such as isoniazid and rifampin, which are used in treating tuberculosis. This impact is due to their induction of oxidative stress and involvement in hepatic metabolism, where MAFK-mediated changes in enzyme expression levels can alter drug efficacy and toxicity by modifying the rate of drug metabolism.
