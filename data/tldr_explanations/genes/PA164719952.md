Aripiprazole, mainly utilized for psychiatric disorders, likely does not interact directly with the FAT1 gene due to its pharmacological characteristics, suggesting any purported interaction may be speculative. Capecitabine, converted into 5-fluorouracil for cancer treatment, could indirectly interact with FAT1 due to the gene's role in colorectal cancer, potentially influencing the drug's effectiveness or toxicity through mechanisms affecting cell proliferation and tumor dynamics, suggesting a pharmacodynamic interaction.
