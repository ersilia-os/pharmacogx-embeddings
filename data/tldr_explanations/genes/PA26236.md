Milatuzumab, a therapeutic monoclonal antibody targeting CD74, often overexpressed in conditions like multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, can have its efficacy and safety influenced by genetic variations in the CD74 gene. These pharmacogenetic interactions affect drug response and adverse effects due to the pharmacodynamic nature of milatuzumab's action, where its effectiveness depends on binding to CD74 to modulate immune responses against tumor cells.
