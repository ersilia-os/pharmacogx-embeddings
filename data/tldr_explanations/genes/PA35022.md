Variations in the TAP2 gene can significantly alter the efficacy of cancer vaccines and immunotherapies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, by impacting the presentation of tumor antigens to the immune system. Although there are no documented direct drug interactions with TAP2, its role in antigen presentation suggests it could influence the pharmacodynamics of immunotherapeutic agents, potentially affecting how these drugs enhance or diminish immune responses against cancer cells.
