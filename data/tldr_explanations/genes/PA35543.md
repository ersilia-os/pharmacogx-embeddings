The CCL11 gene, which plays a key role in immune responses and eosinophil recruitment particularly during allergic inflammation, may affect the pharmacodynamics of drugs like methadone, which could interact with the gene's pathway, potentially altering the drug's immune-related efficacy and side effects in conditions involving eosinophils. This interaction suggests that variations in CCL11 expression might modify the effects of drugs targeting these immune processes, especially in the treatment of asthma and allergies.
