The gene MAP3K5, involved in apoptosis and inflammation, is targeted in cancer therapies through its modulation, particularly affecting the response to kinase inhibitors used in these treatments. These inhibitors may indirectly impact MAP3K5 activity by altering associated signaling pathways, thus influencing drug efficacy and toxicity, primarily related to pharmacodynamics rather than pharmacokinetics.
