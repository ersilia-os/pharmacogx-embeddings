UGT2B11 is involved in the metabolism of drugs and hormones through glucuronidation, impacting their efficacy and toxicity by altering drug solubility and excretion. This enzyme plays a critical role in the pharmacokinetics of potentially estrogen or androgen-targeted therapies and other drugs requiring glucuronidation, like certain pain medications or anti-inflammatories, affecting how quickly they are metabolized and eliminated from the body.
