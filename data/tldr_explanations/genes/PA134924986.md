The DAOA gene, which influences neuroactive amino acid modulation and impacts the DAO enzyme linked to D-serine metabolism at NMDA receptors, has pharmacogenetic interactions relevant to drugs like aripiprazole and methamphetamine. These interactions can alter the effectiveness of aripiprazole in treating schizophrenia and bipolar disorder due to its involvement in glutamatergic pathways, and affect the action of methamphetamine through more complex neurotransmitter system modifications, particularly in neuropsychiatric conditions.
