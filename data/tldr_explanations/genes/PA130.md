CYP3A4, significantly expressed in the liver and small intestine, influences the metabolism and thus the effects and toxicity of many drugs, including tacrolimus, statins like atorvastatin and lovastatin, chemotherapeutics such as docetaxel, and sedatives like midazolam. Interaction with inducers or inhibitors like carbamazepine and erythromycin respectively can either increase or decrease CYP3A4's activity, affecting the metabolism of other drugs such as sildenafil and necessitating dosage adjustments due to changes in pharmacokinetic profiles.
