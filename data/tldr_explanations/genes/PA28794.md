The activity of the gene GNMT, which is involved in methionine and homocysteine metabolism in the liver, indirectly affects the metabolism of drugs such as mercaptopurine, a leukemia treatment. GNMT influences the availability of methylation donors necessary for transforming mercaptopurine into its active metabolites, potentially altering the drug's effectiveness and toxicity by affecting the methylation process required for its biotransformation.
