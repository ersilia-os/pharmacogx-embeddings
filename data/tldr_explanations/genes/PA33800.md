Variants in the PROCR gene affect the effectiveness and safety of drugs like warfarin and heparin used in anticoagulant therapy, as well as treatments in sepsis like protein C concentrates and recombinant thrombomodulin, by altering the protein C anticoagulant pathway. These alterations, which occur at the molecular and cellular level, modify the drugsâ€™ pharmacodynamic interactions rather than their metabolism or clearance, potentially enhancing or diminishing the drugs' antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects.
