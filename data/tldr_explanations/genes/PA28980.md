Valproic acid, acamprosate, and ketamine interact with GRIN2B, a gene crucial for the function of NMDA receptors involved in excitatory neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity, affecting drug metabolism and receptor activity. The effectiveness and side effects of antipsychotics such as quetiapine, risperidone, and clozapine, as well as methylphenidate, might also be influenced by their interactions with neurotransmitter systems related to NMDA receptor function, demonstrating the gene's broad impact on the pharmacodynamics of various neurological and psychotropic drugs.
