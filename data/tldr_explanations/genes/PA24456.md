The gene ACTA2, which encodes for the alpha-2 isoform of smooth muscle actin, is significant in pharmacogenetics primarily through its role in the pharmacodynamics related to vascular muscle behavior, influencing the effectiveness and safety of cardiovascular disease treatments. Specifically, mutations in ACTA2 can affect the therapeutic outcomes of imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat certain cancers, by altering vascular smooth muscle cell function and blood vessel structure, thus potentially leading to vascular side effects or complications.
