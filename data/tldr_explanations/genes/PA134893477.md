Variations in the ZNF568 gene, involved in transcriptional regulation, might indirectly affect the efficacy and safety of drugs by influencing the expression patterns of genes tied to drug metabolism, transport, or action. Currently, no specific drugs have been conclusively identified to interact with ZNF568, and the gene's role in pharmacogenetics is primarily hypothetical.
