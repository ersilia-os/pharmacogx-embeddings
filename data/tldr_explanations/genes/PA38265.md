The interaction between the MIEF2 gene, involved in mitochondrial dynamics and energy metabolism, and the drug duloxetine, an antidepressant and nerve pain medication, operates at a possible pharmacodynamic rather than pharmacokinetic level. This interaction could influence duloxetine's effectiveness and side effects by affecting mitochondrial function and subsequently neurotransmitter dynamics.
