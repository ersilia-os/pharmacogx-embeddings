Methotrexate, an antimetabolite and antifolate drug, is currently the only drug known to potentially interact with TMIGD3 in non-pharmacokinetic ways, mainly due to the gene's role in cell division and proliferation. While no direct pharmacogenetic associations are established yet, TMIGD3's involvement in cellular signaling and architecture suggests potential future implications for drugs targeting tumor microenvironments, particularly in cancer treatment scenarios where control of cell migration and adhesion is vital.
