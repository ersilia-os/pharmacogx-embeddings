SCARB1 gene, encoding for the scavenger receptor class B type 1, interacts pharmacogenetically with drugs like ribavirin, atorvastatin, and fenofibrate, which affect lipid metabolism. Ribavirin's interaction with SCARB1 might influence its absorption or distribution, whereas atorvastatin and fenofibrate, being lipid-lowering agents, directly interact with SCARB1's role in cholesterol and lipid processing, and genetic variants in SCARB1 could variably affect the efficacy of these drugs in managing lipid profiles and cholesterol levels.
