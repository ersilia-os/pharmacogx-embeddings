Drugs such as fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan interact with the gene CSPG4, which is significant in cancer cell signaling and growth, particularly in conditions like melanoma and glioblastoma. These interactions are predominantly pharmacodynamic, impacting the tumor microenvironments and signaling pathways associated with CSPG4, rather than influencing drug metabolism or transport.
