NEFM, despite not participating in drug metabolism or transport, may influence the efficacy and patient response to neuroprotective drugs used in neurodegenerative diseases like ALS, Alzheimer's, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease due to its role in neuronal dynamics. For example, drugs like riluzole for ALS, which affects neuronal signaling, could potentially interact with pathways influenced by NEFM, although this interaction remains theoretical without direct evidence or specific clinical data.
