Variations in the LMNB2 gene, which is crucial for nuclear stability, could potentially affect the efficacy or adverse reactions to drugs used in treating lamin-associated disorders like partial lipodystrophy and muscular dystrophy. Although direct interactions with specific drugs are not clearly established, the geneâ€™s involvement in nuclear structure and integrity may influence how drugs targeting cellular stability and gene expression interact with LMNB2 variants.
