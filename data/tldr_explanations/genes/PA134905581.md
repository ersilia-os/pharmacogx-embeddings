NCOA7, by functioning as a coactivator for estrogen receptors, might interact indirectly with drugs involved in estrogen pathways such as those used in hormone-related cancers; however, its interaction with capecitabine, a chemotherapeutic agent lacking direct links to estrogen signaling, suggests a broader cellular influence, potentially affecting drug response through modulation of cellular transcription factors and tumor microenvironment rather than through direct pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic pathways.
