GSTCD, which is involved in detoxifying xenobiotics and metabolizing drugs through glutathione conjugation, could potentially affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs that require glutathione conjugation similar to how other GST enzymes affect drugs like paracetamol, carboplatin, or busulfan. However, specific drugs known to interact directly with GSTCD have not been clearly identified, and the variability in GSTCD's expression or function could alter drug detoxification efficiency, thus impacting drug efficacy and toxicity.
