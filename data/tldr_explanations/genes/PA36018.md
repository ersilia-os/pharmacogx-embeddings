The SOD3 gene, which plays a role in mitigating oxidative stress, can influence the pharmacodynamics of drugs used in diseases like COPD, asthma, and hypertension by modulating reactive oxygen species levels, affecting their effectiveness. Anti-inflammatory drugs, for example, could interact with SOD3-induced pathophysiology by reducing oxidative damage and indirectly influencing disease state, rather than altering the pharmacokinetics of the drugs directly.
