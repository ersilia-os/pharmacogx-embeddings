CD44 does not interact directly with drugs in traditional pharmacogenetic ways related to metabolism but is significantly targeted in oncology due to its role in cancer progression and cell survival pathways. Although there is no direct interaction with acetaminophen, CD44's involvement in inflammation and immune responses could indirectly influence the drug's secondary effects on immune modulation and cellular adhesion, highlighting the complexity of its potential impacts on pharmacodynamics.
