C9orf72 gene mutations, implicated in ALS and FTD, influence pharmacogenetic interactions by affecting disease progression and treatment responses, but no drugs currently target these mutations directly. Potential therapies like antisense oligonucleotides aim to target pathological RNA associated with C9orf72, and drugs that enhance autophagy may be relevant due to the gene's role in autophagic processes. However, specific drug interactions with C9orf72 mutations are still not fully understood.
