Methylphenidate, a drug used primarily for treating ADHD, might have its efficiency or tolerance affected by PDIA2, a gene involved in protein folding in the brain. This interaction, though not fully understood, suggests that PDIA2â€™s role in the proper structuring of neuronal proteins could indirectly influence the drug's pharmacological effects on the central nervous system.
