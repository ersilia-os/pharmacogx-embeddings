SLC13A2 is involved in the transport of dicarboxylates, influencing the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are structurally related to dicarboxylates or involved in the citric acid cycle. Variations in this gene may affect the renal excretion, clearance, and bioavailability of such drugs, especially in the context of conditions like metabolic disorders or kidney stone formation due to altered citrate metabolism.
