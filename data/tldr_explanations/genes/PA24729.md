Asfotase alfa, a drug used in the management of hypophosphatasia, directly addresses the deficiency caused by mutations in the ALPL gene, which encodes an enzyme essential for bone mineralization. This enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) works by binding to and hydrolyzing substrates in the bone matrix, compensating for the enzyme activity lost due to genetic mutations, and its effectiveness varies based on the specific ALPL mutations present in an individual, highlighting the importance of tailored treatment based on genetic testing.
