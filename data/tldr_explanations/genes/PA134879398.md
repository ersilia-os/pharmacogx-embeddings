Variations in the ARFIP2 gene, which is involved in vesicle formation and cellular trafficking, might affect the intracellular distribution and efficacy of Tacrolimus, a drug dependent on cellular transport for its immunosuppressive effects. This interaction could potentially alter the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, specifically influencing its absorption and distribution within cells, thereby impacting its therapeutic effectiveness and side effects.
