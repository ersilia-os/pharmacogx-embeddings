The gene FAM13A does not interact directly with most therapeutic drugs, but may affect the progression or severity of diseases like COPD and pulmonary fibrosis through its role in cellular signaling and stress responses. Notably, genetic variations in FAM13A could influence the body's response to nicotine exposure, suggesting a pharmacogenetic interaction that may be important in personalizing treatments for nicotine-related lung conditions.
