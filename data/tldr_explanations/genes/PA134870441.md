MTRF1L is involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis, important for energy metabolism, which could hypothetically affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of drugs metabolized by mitochondrial enzymes such as methadone and morphine. Although MTRF1L's influence on the metabolism of these drugs remains theoretical, its role in mitochondrial functionality suggests potential interactions, particularly in individuals with genetic variations affecting MTRF1L function.
