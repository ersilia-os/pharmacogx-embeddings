Mutations in the TRPM6 gene, which is crucial for magnesium homeostasis, impact the efficacy and dosage requirements of magnesium supplements used to treat hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (HSH). Understanding these gene mutations can help tailor magnesium therapy to individual genetic profiles, thereby optimizing treatment efficacy in managing magnesium-related disorders.
