The TBL1XR1 gene, involved in transcription regulation and pathways like NF-κB, may have pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs such as corticosteroids, which alter NF-κB activity, and agents that influence chromatin dynamics, due to its role in transcriptional repression. Additionally, there is a speculative interaction with allopurinol, primarily used to treat gout through the inhibition of xanthine oxidase; this interaction might involve indirect pathways related to inflammation or cellular stress responses potentially affecting TBL1XR1 function.
