SLC12A8, known for facilitating the transport of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) into cells, significantly influences the pharmacokinetics of NMN supplements by affecting their absorption and cellular uptake, particularly in tissues where it is highly expressed, such as the small intestine, skeletal muscle, and liver. This variance in SLC12A8 activity among individuals can lead to differential responses to NMN supplementation, impacting the effectiveness of these nutraceuticals aimed at enhancing NAD+ levels, relevant in metabolic and aging-related processes.
