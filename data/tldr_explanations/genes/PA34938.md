SAMHD1 regulates the availability of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), impacting the activity of nucleotide analogues like stavudine, an HIV treatment drug. This interaction, where SAMHD1's depletion of dNTPs can affect the efficacy of stavudine in the viral replication process, exemplifies the gene's significant influence on the pharmacodynamics and effectiveness of antiretroviral drugs by modulating how these drugs incorporate into DNA.
