The gene PTPRM influences the effectiveness of cancer therapies, especially those involving tyrosine kinase inhibitors and targeting cell adhesion pathways, through a pharmacodynamic mechanism by affecting cellular processes such as differentiation and adhesion. The interaction between PTPRM and these drugs is theorized to hinge on the gene's role in modifying tumor cell behavior and its interactions with the surrounding tumor microenvironment, although specific drugs and their detailed PTPRM-related pharmacogenetic profiles remain insufficiently explored in existing literature.
