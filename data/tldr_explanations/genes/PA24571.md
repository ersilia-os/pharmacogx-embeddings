Variants in the ADH1B gene, such as ADH1B*2 and ADH1B*3, increase the rate at which alcohol is metabolized to acetaldehyde, impacting toxicity and risks for alcohol-related cancers. This rapid metabolism can alter the effectiveness and side-effects of drugs like naltrexone, used in treating alcohol dependence, due to varying acetaldehyde levels that can affect drinking behaviors and drug efficacy.
