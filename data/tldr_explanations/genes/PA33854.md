Variations in the PSD gene, which affects intracellular protein trafficking and neurotransmitter system regulation, might impact the efficacy and safety of psychotropic medications such as antipsychotics and mood stabilizers used for treating neurological and psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The interaction between PSD gene variations and these drugs is likely pharmacodynamic, influencing the neural pathways these medications target and thus altering their therapeutic effects.
