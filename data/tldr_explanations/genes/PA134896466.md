TENM4 has been noted to interact with capecitabine, a prodrug converted to fluorouracil used in cancer treatments. The interaction, not fully understood and potentially linked to TENM4's role in neural cell adhesion or signaling pathways, could influence the drug's efficacy or toxicity by affecting cellular adhesion properties in tumors or altering cellular signaling pathways, hence impacting patient responses to the drug.
