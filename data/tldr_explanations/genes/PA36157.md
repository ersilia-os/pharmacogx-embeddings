Somatostatin analogs such as octreotide, lanreotide, and pasireotide, used in treating acromegaly and certain neuroendocrine tumors, interact with the SSTR4 gene, impacting their efficacy and side effects based on individual genetic variations in SSTR4. These drugs mimic natural somatostatin to regulate hormone secretion and cell proliferation by modulating G protein-coupled receptor pathways that alter adenylate cyclase activity and reduce cAMP levels, with variations in SSTR4 potentially affecting receptor binding and signal transduction, thereby influencing therapeutic outcomes.
