Various drugs, including sotalol, quinidine, amiodarone, disopyramide, fexofenadine, and nitrendipine, interact with the KCNH2 gene, which encodes the hERG channel involved in cardiac repolarization. These drugs block the IKr current mediated by the hERG channel, leading to potentially fatal prolonged QT intervals and increased risk of arrhythmias, with the severity of interaction and direct blocking effects differing among the drugs.
