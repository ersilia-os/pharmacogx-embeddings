The EDNRA gene, which encodes the endothelin receptor type A, interacts significantly with endothelin receptor antagonists like bosentan and ambrisentan, drugs used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension. Genetic variants in EDNRA can alter the effectiveness and safety of these drugs by influencing receptor binding, signal transduction, and thus the extent of vasodilation, as well as potentially increasing the risk of side effects through changes in receptor density or signaling pathways. Although not directly related to pharmacokinetics, there is an inferred interaction with prednisone, suggesting that it may indirectly affect vascular responses and inflammation modulated by EDNRA.
