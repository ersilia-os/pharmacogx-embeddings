Although DPP6 directly affects voltage-gated potassium channel function, impacting neuronal and cardiac rhythms, it has no well-established direct pharmacogenetic interactions with specific drugs. However, drugs like amiodarone or carbamazepine, which modulate potassium channel activity, might have varying effects in individuals depending on their DPP6 genetic profile, primarily due to DPP6's role in regulating cardiac and neurological functions.
