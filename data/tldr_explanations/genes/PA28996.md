Variations in the GRM7 gene, which affects glutamate signaling, can alter the pharmacodynamics of risperidone, a drug used for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. This genetic influence on glutamate neurotransmission may result in variability in therapeutic outcomes and side effects among individuals when treated with risperidone, highlighting the significance of considering GRM7 genetic variations in treatment strategies for neuropsychiatric conditions.
