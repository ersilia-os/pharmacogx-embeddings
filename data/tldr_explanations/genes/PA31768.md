In cancers like melanoma with NRAS mutations, BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib are less effective, thus MEK inhibitors like trametinib are preferred due to their ability to target downstream elements in the NRAS pathway, potentially circumventing signaling issues caused by the mutation. Additionally, in colorectal cancer, NRAS mutations confer resistance to anti-EGFR therapies, emphasizing the need for alternative therapeutic approaches based on the interactions between specific drugs and NRAS mutations.
