DHRS4, an enzyme crucial for converting retinal to retinol and involved in vitamin A metabolism, may influence the pharmacokinetics of retinoid-related drugs such as isotretinoin and acitretin, used for acne and psoriasis respectively, due to its significant expression in the liver and role in similar redox reactions. Additionally, its function in detoxifying aldehydes suggests it might interact with drugs inducing oxidative stress, potentially altering their efficacy or toxicity.
