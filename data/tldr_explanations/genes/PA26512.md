The NLRP3 gene plays a role in determining the effectiveness of biologic drugs such as Anakinra, Canakinumab, and Rilonacept, which target the inflammatory effects mediated by IL-1β in conditions linked to NLRP3 mutations like CAPS. Anakinra blocks IL-1 receptors to reduce inflammation, Canakinumab directly inhibits IL-1β, and Rilonacept traps circulating IL-1, each addressing the inflammatory cascade triggered by NLRP3 overactivation. Aspirin may also interact with NLRP3 through indirect modulation of inflammation pathways, but this interaction is not well-defined and is considered exploratory.
