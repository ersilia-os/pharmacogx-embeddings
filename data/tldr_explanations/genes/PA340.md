SULT1E1 is critical in the pharmacogenetics of hormone-related treatments such as estrogen replacement therapies and hormonal contraceptives by sulfating and inactivating estrogens, which affects the efficacy and toxicity of these drugs. While not directly altering pharmacokinetics, SULT1E1's influence on estrogen metabolism suggests a potential non-pharmacokinetic interaction with methotrexate, particularly in hormone-dependent cancers, where estrogen pathways might intersect with methotrexate's anti-proliferative effects.
