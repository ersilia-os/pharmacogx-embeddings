OR4D6, a gene part of the olfactory receptor family, is primarily associated with sensing odors and does not play a significant role in the metabolism or efficacy of drugs, such as carboplatin and gemcitabine, which are chemotherapeutic agents. Any hypothetical link between OR4D6 and these drugs likely pertains to variations in sensory perception during treatment rather than influencing pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics, thereby rendering its pharmacogenetic relevance minimal.
