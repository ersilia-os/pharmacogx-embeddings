The AGTR1 gene, encoding for the angiotensin II receptor type 1, is crucial in the pharmacodynamics of cardiovascular drugs like angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) including irbesartan, candesartan, and losartan, which treat hypertension by blocking angiotensin II, leading to vasodilation and reduced blood pressure. Genetic variations in AGTR1 can affect the effectiveness of these ARBs as well as ACE inhibitors such as captopril, benazepril, and perindopril, and may also influence the response to other blood pressure medications like hydrochlorothiazide and nitrendipine, thus underscoring the importance of AGTR1 in personalizing cardiovascular treatment.
