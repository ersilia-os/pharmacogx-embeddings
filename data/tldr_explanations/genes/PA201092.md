FOXA3 gene, critical in lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis, interacts pharmacogenetically with rosuvastatin, a drug used for lowering cholesterol. Genetic variations in FOXA3 may affect the drug's ADME profile, influencing rosuvastatin's efficacy and safety, thus highlighting the need for a tailored approach in cholesterol-lowering therapies based on individual FOXA3 genetic profiles.
