SIRT2 inhibitors like AGK2 and sirtinol target the enzyme's role in deacetylation, influencing neurodegenerative disease outcomes by modifying acetylation patterns important for neuronal health and potentially improving neuroprotection and motor functions. In the context of cancer, these inhibitors may also enhance the efficacy of treatments like gefitinib by interacting through cellular signaling pathways related to cell proliferation and survival, though these interactions remain speculative and are not due to direct effects on drug metabolism or distribution.
