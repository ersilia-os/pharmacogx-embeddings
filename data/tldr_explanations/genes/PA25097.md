Although ATP10A, a flippase enzyme, is not extensively studied for direct pharmacogenetic interactions, it could influence the efficacy and metabolism of drugs such as duloxetine and clopidogrel indirectly through its role in membrane trafficking and composition, which are vital for neurotransmitter dynamics and cellular uptake or distribution of drug metabolites, respectively. This suggests that ATP10A might affect the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles of these drugs subtly by impacting fundamental cellular processes in neuronal activity and membrane structures.
