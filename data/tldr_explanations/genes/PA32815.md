SLC22A14, a gene involved in the transport of organic cations and primarily expressed in the testis, lacks established pharmacogenetic interactions with any drugs due to limited research. Currently, there are no known effects from this gene on drug absorption, metabolism, excretion, or pharmacodynamics, making its role in drug response purely speculative at this time.
