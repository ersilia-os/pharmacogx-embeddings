Crizotinib, alectinib, lorlatinib, brigatinib, and ceritinib are ALK inhibitors used in the treatment of ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), each targeting specific genetic alterations in the ALK gene which can affect patient responses and outcomes. Additionally, tepotinib, primarily an MET inhibitor, shows some interaction with ALK pathways, while carbamazepine, despite not targeting ALK, may affect the pharmacokinetics of ALK inhibitors and subsequently influence treatment efficacy.
