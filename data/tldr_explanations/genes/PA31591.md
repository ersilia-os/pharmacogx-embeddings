Drugs such as paliperidone, risperidone, clozapine, and methylphenidate may interact with the gene NFIB, which is involved in growth and developmental pathways, potentially influencing their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles indirectly through NFIB's role in transcriptional regulation, neuronal development, and synaptic plasticity. Although direct interactions between these drugs and NFIB are not clearly established, the gene's influence on drug metabolism and therapeutic effects in neuropsychiatric and developmental contexts could be significant.
