CHRNA5, encoding a subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, impacts the pharmacokinetics of nicotine by affecting the breakdown products like cotinine, thereby influencing smoking cessation success. This gene also affects the pharmacodynamics of smoking cessation drugs such as varenicline, a partial agonist of the nicotinic receptor, and bupropion, which acts as both a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor and a nicotinic receptor antagonist, altering their binding and activity on receptors crucial for reducing nicotine cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Additionally, CHRNA5 interacts indirectly with drugs like cocaine by modulating CNS targets linked to nicotinic receptors, influencing addiction behaviors and therapy responses.
