CSRNP3, involved in transcription regulation and apoptosis, may indirectly influence the effectiveness or toxicity of drugs targeting cancer therapies and neurological treatments, where cell death regulation is vital, as well as potentially affect drugs managing oxidative stress or inflammatory conditions. However, these pharmacogenetic interactions are theoretical and not yet proven with specific drugs or pharmacokinetics mechanisms.
