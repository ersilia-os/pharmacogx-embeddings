The gene ADH6, responsible for encoding Alcohol Dehydrogenase 6, plays a crucial role in the metabolism of ethanol and other alcohols into aldehydes, primarily in the liver, affecting the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized similarly or interacting with alcohol pathways. Specifically, drugs like disulfiram and metronidazole, used in treating alcohol dependence or impacting alcohol metabolism, could be influenced by ADH6 activity variations, thereby altering the rate of alcohol metabolism which impacts the intensity and duration of pharmacological effects of these medications.
