The gene CPA6, involved in neurotransmitter processing and brain function, might interact pharmacogenetically with the antidiabetic drug metformin through an indirect pathway influencing neuronal circuitry, rather than direct pharmacokinetic effects. This interaction is primarily speculative and underexplored but could potentially inform tailored therapies for neurological conditions like epilepsy.
