Pembrolizumab and nivolumab, monoclonal antibodies used in cancer immunotherapy, interact pharmacogenetically with the CD274 gene (PD-L1) by inhibiting its interaction with the PD-1 receptor on T cells, thereby preventing the suppression of immune responses against cancer cells. The effectiveness of these drugs is influenced by the level of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, making PD-L1 a critical biomarker for assessing the suitability of these therapies for specific patients.
