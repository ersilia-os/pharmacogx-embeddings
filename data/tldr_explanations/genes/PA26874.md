Variants in the CRHR1 gene, which plays a crucial role in stress response regulation through the HPA axis, affect the pharmacodynamics of several drugs. These include fluoxetine, which may have altered effectiveness in treating mood disorders, and corticosteroids like dexamethasone, budesonide, and fluticasone propionate, which could have different impacts on conditions like asthma due to changes in glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity and HPA axis dynamics. Additionally, CRHR1 interactions with nicotine highlight its potential influence on the pharmacodynamics of addiction and withdrawal processes.
