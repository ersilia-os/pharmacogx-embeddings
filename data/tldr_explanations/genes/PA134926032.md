MED19, a component involved in gene transcription regulation, indirectly influences drug responses, particularly in cancer therapies, through its impact on gene expression related to cell cycle and metabolism. Variations in the MED19 gene could affect the efficacy or toxicity of drugs that target pathways regulated by MED19, with these interactions likely being pharmacodynamic as MED19 does not directly interact with drugs or alter their metabolism or distribution.
