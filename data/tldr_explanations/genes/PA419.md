UGT1A9 plays a key role in the glucuronidation and metabolism of various drugs, including NSAIDs like diclofenac, antiretrovirals, and chemotherapy agents like irinotecan. Genetic variations in UGT1A9 can significantly influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these drugs, affecting their efficacy and the severity of side effects such as neutropenia, particularly evident in treatments involving mycophenolic acid and irinotecan.
