MGAT4A, which plays a role in glycoprotein biosynthesis, indirectly interacts with chemotherapeutic drugs like oxaliplatin and capecitabine by potentially influencing their pharmacodynamics through its effects on glycoprotein structures. This interaction could modify the cellular mechanisms involved in drug efficacy and toxicity, despite MGAT4A not directly altering drug metabolism or transport.
