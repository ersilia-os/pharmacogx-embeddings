Drugs like erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab target the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in migraine treatment by blocking or neutralizing the peptide to prevent its vasodilatory effects, which are significant in migraine pathophysiology. Erenumab blocks the CGRP receptor, while fremanezumab and galcanezumab bind directly to CGRP, and genetic variations in the CALCA gene could influence the efficacy and safety of these treatments.
