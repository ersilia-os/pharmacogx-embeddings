SLCO3A1, an organic anion transporting polypeptide, is primarily involved in transporting steroid hormones, hinting at interactions with steroidal drugs that could influence their absorption and distribution. While not directly linked to the antiretroviral drug darunavir, SLCO3A1 might indirectly affect darunavir's pharmacokinetics through its role in transporting organic ions, potentially altering the drug's bioavailability or distribution in specific tissues.
