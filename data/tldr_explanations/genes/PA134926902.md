CYP2D7, a pseudogene, does not encode a functional enzyme and thus does not partake in the metabolism of drugs, unlike its close relative CYP2D6, which metabolizes about 25% of clinically used drugs such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, beta-blockers, and opioids. Although CYP2D7 does not directly interact with these drugs, its similarity to CYP2D6 makes its study important for ensuring accurate pharmacogenetic testing and understanding genetic misannotations which can affect drug dosing and therapy.
