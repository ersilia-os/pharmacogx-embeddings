P3H3, primarily involved in collagen modification, shows no well-documented interactions with most drugs, affecting neither their pharmacokinetics nor pharmacodynamics. Speculatively, sertraline, an SSRI, may interact with P3H3 by influencing connective tissue disorders through off-target effects or secondary pathways, but this potential interaction is not yet established and requires further research.
