Studies focusing on the gene DOCK8, which plays a pivotal role in immune cell functions, suggest that its mutations may impact the effectiveness of cancer treatments like carboplatin and gemcitabine. This influence is likely not due to direct pharmacokinetic interactions, but rather through pharmacodynamic changes related to how DOCK8 mutations affect the immune system's response to these drugs and their cytotoxic effects.
