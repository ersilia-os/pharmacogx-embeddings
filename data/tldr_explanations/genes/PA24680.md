AKR1C4, a key enzyme in metabolizing steroids and lipids, influences the metabolism and clearance of naltrexone and exemestane, impacting their efficacy and safety. Genetic variants of AKR1C4 may alter how naltrexone, used for managing alcohol and opioid dependence, and exemestane, used in breast cancer treatment, are metabolized in the liver, potentially affecting their therapeutic effectiveness and side-effect profiles.
