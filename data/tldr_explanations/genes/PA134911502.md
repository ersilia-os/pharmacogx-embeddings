SLC22A16 plays a critical role in the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic drug, by affecting its transport and thereby influencing the drug's efficacy and potential for cardiac toxicity. Although primarily involved with doxorubicin, SLC22A16 may also affect other chemotherapy drugs like fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide, potentially altering their metabolism or mechanisms of action rather than their transport.
