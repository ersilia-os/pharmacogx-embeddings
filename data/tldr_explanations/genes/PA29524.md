Drugs such as ganetespib, luminespib, and onalespib are HSP90 inhibitors that target the ATP-binding domain of HSP90AB1, affecting its chaperone activity vital for oncogenic proteinsâ€™ maturation and stability. Genetic variations in the HSP90AB1 gene can influence the effectiveness and side effects of these drugs by altering the drug's binding affinity or the expression levels of HSP90AB1, emphasizing the importance of pharmacogenetic interactions in personalized cancer therapy.
