Variations in the CHUK gene could influence the effectiveness of drugs that target the NF-κB pathway, such as glucocorticoids for treating inflammatory conditions and certain chemotherapy agents for cancer, since these drugs work by modulating NF-κB activity. Consequently, genetic differences in CHUK might impact how effectively these medications inhibit NF-κB, thereby affecting their efficacy or potency in managing inflammation or cancer cell survival.
