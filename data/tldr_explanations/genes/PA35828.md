The gene SLC1A3, coding for EAAT1, significantly affects the pharmacodynamics of drugs that modulate glutamate neurotransmission by influencing glutamate availability in the brain. Drugs such as glutamate reuptake inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists (e.g., Memantine) may have altered efficacy depending on SLC1A3 expression or function, potentially impacting therapeutic outcomes for neurological conditions where glutamate dysregulation is prevalent.
