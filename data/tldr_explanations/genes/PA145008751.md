Variations in the PRIMPOL gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in DNA replication and repair, can influence the effectiveness and toxicity of genotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs such as platinum-based agents (cisplatin and carboplatin) and alkylating agents. PRIMPOL's role in re-initiating DNA synthesis past drug-induced DNA damage might lead to resistance in cancer cells, affecting treatment outcomes and requiring consideration in therapy customization and targeting DNA repair mechanisms in cancer treatment strategies.
