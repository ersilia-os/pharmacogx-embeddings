The drug VX-765, a CASP1 inhibitor, targets the enzyme directly to mitigate inflammatory responses in diseases like CAPS, gout, and Type 2 diabetes. Meanwhile, ribavirin interacts with CASP1 possibly by modulating immune responses linked to inflammation during viral infections, though this interaction is indirect compared to the enzymatic inhibition seen with VX-765.
