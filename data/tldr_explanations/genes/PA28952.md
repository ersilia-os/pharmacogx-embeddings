Drugs and nutrients such as Vitamin E and Selenium influence the activity of GPX4, an enzyme crucial in protecting cells from oxidative stress by reducing lipid peroxides. Vitamin E protects cell membranes, potentially easing GPX4's workload, while Selenium, necessary for glutathione peroxidases including GPX4, affects the enzyme's capacity to manage oxidative stress, guiding personalized treatment strategies in diseases like Alzheimer's and certain cancers where oxidative mechanisms are pivotal.
