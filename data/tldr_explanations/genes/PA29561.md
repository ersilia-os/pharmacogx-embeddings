The gene HTR7, which encodes the serotonin receptor 7, interacts with various antidepressants and drugs that modulate serotonin, such as SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, citalopram) and SNRIs (e.g., venlafaxine, duloxetine), influencing their pharmacodynamic properties, efficacy, and side effects through serotonin signaling. Additionally, HTR7 potentially interacts with drugs like atomoxetine and statins (e.g., atorvastatin, simvastatin), suggesting both known impacts on therapeutic effectiveness and speculated pharmacodynamic effects related to serotonin pathways.
