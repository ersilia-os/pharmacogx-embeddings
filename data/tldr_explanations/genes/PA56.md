Doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic agent, interacts with the FASLG gene, which plays a role in apoptosis and immune system regulation, potentially enhancing the drug's effectiveness in inducing cancer cell death by promoting apoptosis through the FAS/FASLG pathway. This interaction also affects the safety of the drug, particularly in terms of immune-related side effects, highlighting the importance of genetic variations in the FASLG gene for personalized medicine in oncology.
