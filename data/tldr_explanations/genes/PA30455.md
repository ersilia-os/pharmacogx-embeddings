Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, interacts with the LRP5 gene by potentially affecting bone density and remodeling through pathways such as the Wnt signaling, exacerbating bone-related issues in patients with lower bone density due to LRP5 mutations. Additionally, the interplay between LRP5 and osteoporosis drugs like bisphosphonates, denosumab, and teriparatide is not well-established, but given LRP5's role in bone formation, it could affect the efficacy of these treatments by influencing bone density and response to mechanical stress.
