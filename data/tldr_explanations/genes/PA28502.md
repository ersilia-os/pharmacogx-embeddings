Variants in the GABRG3 gene, which encodes the gamma3 subunit of GABAA receptors, could potentially influence the effectiveness and safety of benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and propofol, all of which modulate GABAA receptor activity through different mechanisms. Benzodiazepines enhance the frequency of receptor channel openings, barbiturates increase the duration of these openings, and propofol augments the receptor's response at higher GABA concentrations, impacting the management of anxiety, insomnia, and seizures.
