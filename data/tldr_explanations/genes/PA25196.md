Lithium, commonly used for treating bipolar disorder, affects Wnt signaling and its dynamics can be altered by variations in the AXIN2 gene, influencing the drug's outcomes or side effects in individuals. Moreover, AXIN2 is crucial for the effectiveness of drugs targeting the Wnt pathway, often used in addressing cancers such as colorectal and hepatocellular carcinoma, where gene variants can modify drug efficacy due to changes in pathway activity.
