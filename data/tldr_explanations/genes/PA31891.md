Variants of the BDNF gene, such as Val66Met, affect the efficacy and response to neuropsychiatric drugs including antidepressants (like escitalopram and sertraline), mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics (such as risperidone and olanzapine), as these variants modulate neuroplasticity and neuronal health. Additionally, non-psychiatric drugs such as metformin and nicotine have also shown interactions with BDNF gene variants, impacting their effectiveness in treating various conditions like depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.
