CXCL5 impacts drug efficacy indirectly through the CXCL5-CXCR2 pathway, particularly in relation to diseases like COPD, asthma, and various cancers. Genetic variations in CXCL5 expression or functionality can influence the effectiveness of CXCR2 inhibitors, which aim to modify CXCL5 activity by targeting its receptor, thus underlining the importance of personalized medicine in managing inflammatory and oncological conditions.
