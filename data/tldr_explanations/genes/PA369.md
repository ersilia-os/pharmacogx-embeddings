Variants in the XRCC1 gene impact the efficacy and toxicity of various chemotherapeutic drugs, such as carboplatin and oxaliplatin, by influencing their DNA damage and repair mechanisms. Drugs including fluorouracil, capecitabine, epirubicin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, gemcitabine, and azacitidine require effective DNA repair pathways, where XRCC1 plays a crucial role, affecting treatment outcomes based on individual genetic differences.
