The gene CLCN6, involved in chloride ion transport, influences the pharmacodynamics of drugs like doxorubicin, methotrexate, pemetrexed, aripiprazole, risperidone, and carbamazepine by affecting lysosomal functioning and cellular ion balance, which can alter drug toxicity or effectiveness. Additionally, in the context of hypertension medications such as enalapril and benazepril, alterations in CLCN6 expression may impact drug efficacy due to its expression in kidneys and its role in ion homeostasis.
