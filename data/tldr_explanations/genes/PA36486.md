Variations in the TGFBR2 gene, which is involved in important cellular processes such as proliferation and apoptosis, may affect the efficacy and safety of drugs like irinotecan, particularly in cancers like colorectal cancer where TGFBR2 mutations are common. These interactions are likely through modulation of tumor responses rather than through effects on the pharmacokinetics of the drugs.
