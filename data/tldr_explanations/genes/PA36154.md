Octreotide and Lanreotide, which are somatostatin analogs, interact pharmacodynamically with the SSTR1 gene by binding to its receptors, mimicking natural somatostatin, and inhibiting excessive hormone release in conditions like acromegaly and carcinoid syndrome. Genetic variations in SSTR1 may affect the efficacy and signaling pathways of these drugs, potentially influencing therapeutic outcomes.
