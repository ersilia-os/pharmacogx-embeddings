Cinacalcet, a calcimimetic drug, interacts with the CASR gene primarily through pharmacodynamic mechanisms by mimicking calcium activity on the CASR, highly expressed in the parathyroid glands and kidneys. Variations in CASR gene expression or specific genetic polymorphisms affect the sensitivity of the calcium-sensing receptor, impacting the efficacy of Cinacalcet and necessitating dosage adjustments to manage conditions like secondary hyperparathyroidism effectively.
