Ustekinumab and Guselkumab are drugs that modulate immune responses in diseases like psoriasis by targeting different subunits of the cytokine IL-23, which is involved in the IL-23 pathway mediated by the gene IL23A. Ustekinumab binds to the p40 subunit shared by IL-12 and IL-23, reducing their activity, while Guselkumab specifically targets the p19 subunit of IL-23, leading to selective inhibition of this cytokine and its pro-inflammatory effects through Th17 cells.
