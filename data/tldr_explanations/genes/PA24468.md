Although ACTG1 is primarily involved with actin filaments and does not directly target drugs like vincristine, which affects microtubules, it can still influence the efficacy or toxicity of vincristine. This interaction occurs through changes in cellular architecture and dynamics that affect cell cycle and apoptosis pathways critical in cancer treatment.
