The ARSA gene is primarily linked to treatments such as enzyme replacement or gene therapy for Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD), with limited traditional drug interactions affecting its function. However, methylphenidate, used typically for ADHD, might indirectly help manage neurological symptoms in MLD by stimulating the central nervous system, despite not altering the genetic or functional pathway of ARSA directly.
