Variations in the IL10 gene, which encodes the anti-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin 10, can affect the effectiveness and safety of drugs used in managing autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. For drugs like sirolimus and tacrolimus, IL10 could potentially alter pharmacokinetics through its impact on cytokine signaling pathways, affecting how these drugs are metabolized or distributed. On the other hand, non-pharmacokinetic interactions might occur with drugs like methotrexate and others, as IL10's modulation of the immune response may influence their pharmacodynamic properties, altering drug efficacy or tolerability.
