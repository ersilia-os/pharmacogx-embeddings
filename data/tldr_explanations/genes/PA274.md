PNMT plays a key role in converting norepinephrine to epinephrine, influencing cardiovascular system response via epinephrine levels. While not directly involved in typical pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions, variations in the PNMT gene can alter patient responses to medications that affect catecholamine pathways, impacting the treatment of conditions like hypertension by modifying heart rate, blood pressure, and stress responses.
