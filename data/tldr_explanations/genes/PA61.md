The ATM gene plays a crucial role in DNA repair and is significantly implicated in the pharmacogenetics of cancer treatment drugs like doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and fluorouracil, which induce DNA damage and interact with ATM's DNA repair pathway. Variants in the ATM gene can modify how patients respond to these drugs, affecting both their effectiveness and the severity of side effects, where impaired ATM function can increase drug efficacy and toxicity, while hyperactive ATM might lead to drug resistance.
