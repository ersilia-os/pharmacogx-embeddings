The GCLC gene, responsible for glutathione synthesis, interacts pharmacogenetically with drugs like cisplatin, doxorubicin, and sulfamethoxazole, which induce oxidative stress. Variations in the GCLC gene can influence the efficacy and side effect profile of these drugs, as they rely on glutathione for detoxification and mitigating cellular damage. This interaction underscores the importance of considering genetic differences in managing therapies that involve oxidative stress mechanisms.
