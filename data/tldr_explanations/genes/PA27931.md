The EYA1 gene, mainly involved in organ development, does not directly influence the pharmacogenetics of most drugs, including aspirin, although it is associated with developmental disorders like Branchiootorenal (BOR) syndrome. The interaction of aspirin with EYA1-related conditions appears to be pharmacodynamic, potentially affecting drug responses in BOR syndrome patients due to abnormal tissue developments, rather than through a direct pharmacogenetic mechanism related to EYA1.
