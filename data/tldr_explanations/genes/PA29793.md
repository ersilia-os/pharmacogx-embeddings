The pharmacogenetics of IL16 influences the effectiveness and side effects of immune-modulating drugs, especially those targeting CD4+ T-cells, such as antiretrovirals for HIV and monoclonal antibodies for certain cancers, as well as corticosteroids and other anti-inflammatory agents for asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. IL16, by modulating immune cell migration and activation due to genetic variations, affects these drugs primarily through pharmacodynamic mechanisms related to immune regulation.
