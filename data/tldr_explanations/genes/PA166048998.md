The ARHGEF28 gene, involved in the activation of Rho GTPases and cellular functions, may interact pharmacodynamically with drugs like methylphenidate, which is used to treat ADHD. This interaction is significant as it could influence the efficacy and response variability of the drug due to ARHGEF28's role in neuronal signaling pathways. Additionally, alterations in the ARHGEF28 function could impact the effects of drugs targeting cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular motility in neurological and cancer treatments.
