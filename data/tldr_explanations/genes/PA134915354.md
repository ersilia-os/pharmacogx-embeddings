Changes in the activity or expression of PNPT1, a key enzyme in mitochondrial RNA processing, could influence the effectiveness or toxicity of drugs like enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor used for hypertension and heart failure. The interaction with enalapril may be pharmacodynamic, involving mitochondrial pathways affected by PNPT1, possibly altering the drugâ€™s effects at a cellular level in tissues with high mitochondrial activity.
