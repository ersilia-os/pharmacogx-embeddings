Statins such as rosuvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, cerivastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin target the HMGCR enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis to lower blood cholesterol levels. Variants in the HMGCR gene can alter the efficacy and safety of statins, with specific polymorphisms influencing the drugs' therapeutic effects and the risk of adverse events like myopathy, making genetic profiling of HMGCR essential for personalized statin therapy.
