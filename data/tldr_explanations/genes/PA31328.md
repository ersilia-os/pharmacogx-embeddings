The MUTYH gene, involved in DNA repair, does not interact directly with drugs; however, its mutations increase colorectal cancer risk, indirectly affecting the pharmacogenetic response to chemotherapy drugs like fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide. These drugs impede cancer growth by disrupting DNA processes, and individuals with MUTYH-associated polyposis may respond differently to these treatments due to their compromised DNA repair capabilities.
