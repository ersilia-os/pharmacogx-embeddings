The drugs cytarabine, idarubicin, and fludarabine might interact indirectly with the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase 1A (ADH1A), encoded by the ADH1A gene, which is critical in metabolizing ethanol and related compounds. Variations in ADH1A activity can affect the metabolism and effectiveness of these drugs, altering pharmacokinetics and possibly influencing drug action and toxicity, especially in patients with genetic variations or liver-compromised conditions.
