PDE3A inhibitors such as cilostazol and milrinone, used for treating cardiovascular conditions, function by inhibiting PDE3A activity which leads to increased cyclic AMP levels, resulting in enhanced blood flow and reduced clotting by promoting vasodilation and decreasing platelet aggregation. Additionally, hydrochlorothiazide, though not a direct inhibitor, may interact indirectly with PDE3A pathways, influencing blood pressure regulation or vascular effects. Genetic variations in PDE3A can alter patient responses to these medications, affecting their safety and effectiveness.
