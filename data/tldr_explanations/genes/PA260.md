ORM1 plays a significant role in drug pharmacokinetics by binding to medications, which affects their distribution and metabolism, especially during inflammatory responses when its expression increases. Specifically, variations in the ORM1 gene can impact the pharmacodynamics of warfarin, a common anticoagulant, potentially altering its effectiveness and safety by changing how its anticoagulant effects are developed and sustained during states of inflammation.
