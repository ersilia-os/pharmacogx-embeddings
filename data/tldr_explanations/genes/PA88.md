Variants in the CACNB2 gene, which regulates voltage-dependent calcium channels, can significantly impact the effectiveness and metabolism of calcium channel blockers like verapamil, used in treating arrhythmias and hypertension. These genetic variations may affect verapamil's interaction with calcium channels, potentially altering the drugâ€™s ability to stabilize heart rhythms or control blood pressure due to changes in the channels' expression or function.
