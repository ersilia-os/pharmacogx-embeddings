PRRC2A, involved in protein degradation and mRNA processing, is suggested to impact the pharmacodynamics of drugs such as carbamazepine, used in neurological disorders by potentially affecting neuronal protein processing, and carboplatin and gemcitabine, used in cancer therapy, where it may influence cellular stress responses and proteostasis mechanisms, thereby potentially altering drug efficacy and treatment outcomes based on the gene's variants.
