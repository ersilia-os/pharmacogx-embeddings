Synthetic derivatives of erythropoietin, such as epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa, are used to treat anemia by mimicking the natural hormone and stimulating erythropoiesis, but their effectiveness and safety can be influenced by genetic variations in the EPO gene or its receptor, EPOR. Additionally, ribavirin, used for hepatitis C, can induce hemolytic anemia, which might be managed by co-administering EPO, though the efficacy of this interaction may depend on the genetic makeup of the EPO pathway.
