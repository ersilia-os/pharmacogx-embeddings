CACNA1E interacts pharmacogenetically with calcium channel blockers and fentanyl due to its role in calcium signaling, critical in neural excitability and seizure susceptibilities. While calcium channel blockers are utilized because of their direct relevance to CACNA1E's function, fentanyl interacts in a non-pharmacokinetic manner, potentially affecting calcium channel-related signaling pathways without altering drug metabolism or transport. These interactions are important for understanding the treatment of epilepsy and managing pain in patients with CACNA1E-related dysfunctions.
