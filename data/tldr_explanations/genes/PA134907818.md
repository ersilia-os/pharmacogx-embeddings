The NUBPL gene, linked with mitochondrial complex I assembly, may interact indirectly with drugs such as iloperidone due to its role in energy metabolism and mitochondrial function. Although no specific studies have confirmed a direct pharmacogenetic interaction between NUBPL mutations and iloperidone, the gene's influence on mitochondrial processes suggests potential pharmacodynamic interactions with drugs affecting these pathways.
