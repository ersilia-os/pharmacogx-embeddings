The PLEKHJ1 gene, known for its protein-protein interaction role via a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, is theorized to potentially interact with the drug candesartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker used to treat hypertension. This interaction, predicated on the PH domainâ€™s involvement in signaling pathways relevant to candesartan's action on angiotensin II receptor activities, could influence the efficacy or adverse effect profile of the drug, although clear evidence and clinical relevance have yet to be established.
