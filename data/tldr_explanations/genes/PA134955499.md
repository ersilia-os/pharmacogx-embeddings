METTL3, a gene crucial in mRNA methylation, plays a significant role in pharmacogenetics related to cancer treatment, particularly influencing the efficacy and action of therapy in conditions like acute myeloid leukemia and glioblastoma. Drugs targeting METTL3 or modulating its activity could change cancer cell pharmacodynamics, impacting responses to treatments by altering gene expression and cellular behaviors like apoptosis and proliferation, thereby potentially changing therapeutic outcomes.
