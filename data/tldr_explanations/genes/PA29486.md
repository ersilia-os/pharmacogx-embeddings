The HSD3B1 gene variant, HSD3B1(1245C), is linked to increased enzyme activity affecting drug responses, notably reducing the effectiveness of abiraterone in prostate cancer treatment due to its altered metabolism into less active metabolites. In contrast, drugs like hydrochlorothiazide, which are not involved in HSD3B1's enzymatic pathway, may not have direct pharmacogenetic interactions, although indirect effects through HSD3B1's role in hormone pathways may still influence the drug's effectiveness in broader physiological contexts.
