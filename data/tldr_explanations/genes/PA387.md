The gene SLC28A1 encodes a sodium/nucleoside cotransporter that affects the pharmacokinetics of nucleoside analog drugs such as ribavirin, zidovudine, ara-CTP, and gemcitabine by altering their absorption and cellular uptake. This interaction impacts drug concentrations in plasma and thus influences the efficacy and toxicity of therapies, particularly in antiviral and anticancer treatments.
