The OPRK1 gene, which encodes the kappa opioid receptor, significantly influences the interaction of various drugs, mainly opioids and opioid receptor modulators. Variants in this gene affect the efficacy and side effects of drugs like pentazocine, buprenorphine, cocaine, heroin, methadone, morphine, butorphanol, and naltrexone, as these substances interact with the kappa opioid receptor differently depending on the genetic makeup of OPRK1, thereby impacting pain management, addiction treatment, drug metabolism, and overall drug effectiveness.
