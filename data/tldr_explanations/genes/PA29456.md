The HRH1 gene, which codes for the Histamine Receptor H1, is critical in the effectiveness and reaction to antihistamines like diphenhydramine, loratadine, cetirizine, and desloratadine, which block histamineâ€™s action to alleviate allergy symptoms. Additionally, genetic variations in HRH1 can also affect the antihistamine properties of olanzapine, an antipsychotic, potentially influencing its efficacy and side effects due to its interaction with the HRH1 receptor.
