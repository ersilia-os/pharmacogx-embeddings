CYP2C18 plays a modest role in the metabolism of drugs like warfarin, escitalopram, and clozapine, mainly affecting their clearance or efficacy to a lesser extent than more prominent CYP enzymes. Genetic variations in CYP2C18 could influence the pharmacodynamics of drugs such as clopidogrel and acenocoumarol, rather than their pharmacokinetic profiles, indicating a potential need for personalized medicine considerations despite the enzyme's relative minor role.
