The gene CAMK1D, involved in calcium signaling and insulin secretion, may interact with drugs like hydrochlorothiazide and losartan, which are used for hypertension and could affect calcium signaling and insulin pathways influenced by CAMK1D. Although the specific pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions with these drugs have not been thoroughly detailed, there is a theoretical consideration of interaction based on CAMK1D's role in biological functions related to these pathways.
