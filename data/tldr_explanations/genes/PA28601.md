Variants of the GC gene, which affects the binding and transport of vitamin D and its metabolites, alter their bioavailability and can impact the dosing requirements for vitamin D supplements in managing bone and immune health. While there is no direct evidence of GC modulating the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel, deferasirox, and irinotecan, the gene's role in immune modulation may indirectly affect the efficacy or side effects of these drugs, highlighting the relevance of considering GC genotypes in personalized medicine.
