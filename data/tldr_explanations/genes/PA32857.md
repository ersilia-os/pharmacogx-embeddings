The OXT gene, associated with the hormone oxytocin, influences responses to synthetic oxytocin used in obstetrics to induce labor and manage hemorrhage, likely due to genetic variance in its receptor, OXTR. Additionally, interactions between OXT pathways and the antipsychotic drug clozapine may impact neuropsychiatric conditions like schizophrenia, suggesting a broader role for OXT in pharmacodynamic interactions beyond obstetrics.
