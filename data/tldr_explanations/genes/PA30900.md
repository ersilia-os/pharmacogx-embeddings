Pharmacogenetic interactions involving the MOCS1 gene are significant in the treatment of Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency (MoCD) type A, particularly with the use of fosdenopterin. This drug, a synthetic analog of cPMP, is used to bypass the genetic block in molybdenum cofactor synthesis caused by MOCS1 mutations, but its effectiveness varies with the specific mutations present, necessitating tailored dosing based on genetic testing.
