MMP10, a gene involved in the breakdown of the extracellular matrix, influences the effectiveness of MMP inhibitors like marimastat or batimastat used in the treatment of diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and inflammatory responses. The activity of MMP10 affects the pharmacodynamics of these drugs, potentially altering their efficacy, particularly in oncology, by impacting tumor invasion and metastasis control.
