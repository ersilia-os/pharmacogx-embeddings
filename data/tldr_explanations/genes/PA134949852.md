SLCO6A1, a gene encoding a protein in the organic anion transporter family, is suspected to play a role in the pharmacokinetics of drugs, particularly those affecting the central nervous system and those requiring passage across the blood-brain barrier. However, specific pharmacogenetic interactions between SLCO6A1 and individual drugs have not been well-documented as of now.
