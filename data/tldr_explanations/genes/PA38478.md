Genetic variations in the gene SLC22A12, which regulates uric acid reabsorption in kidneys, influence the effectiveness and safety of uricosuric drugs such as probenecid and lesinurad by affecting their interactions with the URAT1 transporter. Additionally, SLC22A12 variations can alter the pharmacodynamics of drugs like cytarabine, fludarabine, idarubicin, allopurinol, and losartan, potentially due to competitive transport or changes in renal excretion processes influenced by the transporter.
