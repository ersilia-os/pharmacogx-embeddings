Despite SH2D5's role in signaling pathways and primary expression in the brain and testis, there is no confirmed evidence of direct interactions between SH2D5 gene variations and the pharmacokinetics or dynamics of the anticancer drug gemcitabine. The potential influence of SH2D5 on gemcitabine, primarily through signaling pathways affecting cellular proliferation and response to therapy, remains speculative without direct evidence.
