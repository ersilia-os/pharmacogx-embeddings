The GSTT2 gene, involved in cellular detoxification by aiding the conjugation of glutathione to various compounds, influences the pharmacokinetics and detoxification of chemotherapeutic drugs such as busulfan and chlorambucil, which undergo glutathione-related reactions. This suggests that genetic variations in GSTT2 could impact drug clearance and toxicity, potentially affecting treatment efficacy and susceptibility to drug-induced oxidative stress in chemotherapy.
