Adenosine Kinase (ADK) influences the metabolism and potential efficacy of drugs like azathioprine through its role in purine metabolism, although specific pharmacogenetic interactions have not been conclusively demonstrated. Azathioprine, which is metabolized into 6-mercaptopurine, may be affected by variations in ADK activity, suggesting a pharmacodynamic relationship that could impact drug dosing and adverse effects based on genetic differences in the ADK gene.
