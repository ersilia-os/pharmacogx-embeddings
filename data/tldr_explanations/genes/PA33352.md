The PKLR gene, vital for metabolism in liver and red blood cells, can affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs like atorvastatin, which depends on hepatic processes that may be altered if PKLR function is impaired. Additionally, PKLR interactions are crucial in the pharmacodynamics of mitapivat, a drug targeting pyruvate kinase deficiency, as it activates the pyruvate kinase enzyme potentially affected by PKLR mutations, impacting its efficacy.
