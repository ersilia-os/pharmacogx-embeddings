The drug risperidone may interact with the gene PPA2, which plays a critical role in ATP synthesis and energy metabolism. This interaction is likely pharmacodynamic, suggesting that risperidone might affect mitochondrial function or worsen metabolic disturbances in patients with PPA2-related conditions, potentially impacting both the efficacy and safety of treatments.
