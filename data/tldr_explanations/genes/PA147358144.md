DHRS13 is involved in metabolic processes that could potentially interact with the pharmacokinetics of drugs, though specific pathways and drug interactions remain poorly understood and speculative. Due to its role in oxidation-reduction processes affecting lipids, amino acids, carbohydrates, and steroids, DHRS13 could hypothetically influence drug efficacy or toxicity; however, concrete pharmacogenetic associations with specific drugs have not been established.
