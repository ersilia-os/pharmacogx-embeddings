Drugs such as mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus, which are used as immunosuppressants in organ transplantation, might interact indirectly with the gene DALRD3 via its role in protein synthesis. Changes in DALRD3 function could alter the effectiveness or toxicity of these drugs by affecting the rate or accuracy of protein translation, which is crucial for immune cell function.
