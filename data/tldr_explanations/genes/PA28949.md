Variants in the GPX1 gene, which is essential for detoxifying oxidative substances, can alter the effectiveness of the enzyme in neutralizing oxidative byproducts from drugs like doxorubicin and cisplatin, both of which induce oxidative stress as a mechanism of action in chemotherapy. These GPX1 polymorphisms may affect a patient's response to these drugs, either increasing the risk of adverse effects due to reduced enzyme activity, or enhancing drug efficacy and safety through increased enzyme activity.
