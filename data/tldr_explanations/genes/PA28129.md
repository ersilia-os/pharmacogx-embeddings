Erdafitinib, infigratinib, and pemigatinib are drugs that specifically target and inhibit FGFR3 kinase activity in cancers, such as urothelial carcinoma, where FGFR3 genetic alterations drive tumor growth. They work by hindering downstream signaling pathways like MAPK and PI3K-Akt, which are crucial for cell survival and proliferation, thereby aligning their therapeutic effects with the genetic profile of the tumor.
