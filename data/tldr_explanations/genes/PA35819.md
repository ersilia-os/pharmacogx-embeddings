SLC16A7, a gene encoding a monocarboxylate transporter, influences the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate by potentially affecting its absorption, distribution, or excretion within the body due to genetic variations in the transporter. This interaction implies that different genotypes of SLC16A7 can lead to varying responses to methotrexate treatment in terms of drug effectiveness and safety.
