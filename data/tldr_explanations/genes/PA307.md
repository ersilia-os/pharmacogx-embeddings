Variants in the SCNN1G gene significantly affect the function of drugs like hydrochlorothiazide, torasemide, furosemide, and bumetanide, which alter sodium reabsorption in the kidneys through their interaction with the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). These variations can influence the drugs' effectiveness in managing conditions such as hypertension by impacting how the body responds to medication, potentially necessitating adjustments in drug selection and dosage based on individual genetic profiles.
