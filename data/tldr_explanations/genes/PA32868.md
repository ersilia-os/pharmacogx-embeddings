The P2RY1 gene, which encodes the Purinergic Receptor P2Y1, plays a role in platelet aggregation and interacts with anti-platelet drugs such as clopidogrel and aspirin. Clopidogrel and aspirin influence platelet function by interacting with the signaling pathways mediated by P2RY1; clopidogrel directly targets pathways where P2RY1 is involved, potentially affecting its efficacy based on genetic variations, while aspirin's effect may intersect more indirectly and distally with P2RY1-related pathways. These interactions are important for the effectiveness of treatments in conditions like myocardial infarction and stroke, suggesting that genetic variations in P2RY1 can influence patient outcomes.
