While the direct interactions between TMEM43 and specific drugs are not well-documented, the gene's role in maintaining the nuclear envelope and cellular signaling pathways suggests potential pharmacological targets for conditions like arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy type 5 (ARVD/C5). Hypothetical drug interactions may include those that modulate cellular signaling disrupted by TMEM43 mutations, aiming to enhance cell survival or decrease apoptosis, presenting a tailored therapeutic approach for cardiovascular diseases influenced by this gene.
