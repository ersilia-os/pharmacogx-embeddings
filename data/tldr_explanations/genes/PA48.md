Corticosteroids and NSAIDs, which are used to manage conditions like asthma and arthritis respectively, may have their effectiveness and side effects influenced by variations in the activity of the ALOX15 gene, which is involved in inflammation and immune system regulation through its role in metabolizing arachidonic acid. These drugs do not directly target ALOX15 but affect the pathways it modulates, suggesting that individual differences in ALOX15 function could impact drug responses and highlight the potential for more personalized treatment approaches in inflammatory diseases.
