The gene FBXL17, which affects the ubiquitin-proteasome system crucial for protein degradation and cellular regulation, has no direct and well-established drug interactions, including with hydrochlorothiazide. The speculated interaction with hydrochlorothiazide stems from its potential indirect effects on cellular stress responses, which might affect the protein degradation pathways regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, but this association lacks strong empirical support.
