Variations in the ALOX5 gene can affect the efficacy of zileuton and montelukast, drugs used in treating asthma and allergic rhinitis. Zileuton directly inhibits the ALOX5 enzyme to reduce leukotriene production, while montelukast blocks leukotriene receptors, with genetic variations influencing how effectively these actions occur.
