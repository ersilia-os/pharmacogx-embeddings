DDX12P, a pseudogene, does not directly participate in drug interactions or affect drug response as it does not encode functional proteins, nor does it engage in the processes required for drug metabolism or the modulation of drug efficacy and toxicity. Therefore, there are no pharmacogenetic interactions involving DDX12P affecting the action of drugs.
