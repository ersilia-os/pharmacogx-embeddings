Variations in the DMPK gene can influence the effectiveness of drugs like mexiletine, insulin, and beta-blockers used to manage symptoms of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Mexiletine's efficacy may be affected by how DMPK alterations impact muscle signaling and ion channel function, insulin's role could be altered in DM1-associated diabetes through effects on pancreatic beta-cell function, and beta-blockers or other antiarrhythmic drugs' effectiveness might vary due to DMPK's role in cardiac muscle function and regulation.
