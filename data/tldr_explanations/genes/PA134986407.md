Variations in the CYP2R1 gene can affect the efficiency of vitamin D metabolism by altering the enzyme's ability to convert vitamin D into 25-hydroxyvitamin D, influencing the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation. Additionally, interactions between CYP2R1 and ribavirin don't involve direct metabolism by the enzyme but may involve indirect effects related to ribavirinâ€™s impact on vitamin D levels or bone health, potentially affecting treatment outcomes in conditions like chronic hepatitis C.
