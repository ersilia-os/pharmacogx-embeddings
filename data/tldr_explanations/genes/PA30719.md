Variations in the MDM4 gene, which regulates the tumor suppressor p53, can affect the efficacy of certain cancer therapies like docetaxel and epirubicin. Although these drugs do not directly inhibit the MDM4-p53 interaction, MDM4's control over p53 can modulate their effectiveness in triggering cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, crucial processes in cancer treatment.
