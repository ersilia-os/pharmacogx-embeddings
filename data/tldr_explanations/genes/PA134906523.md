CES1P1, being a pseudogene of CES1, does not encode functional enzymes or directly affect drug metabolism, but due to its genetic similarity to CES1, it might indirectly influence the metabolism of drugs like clopidogrel, oseltamivir, and capecitabine by affecting CES1 expression. This indirect impact could alter how these drugs are processed, specifically affecting the formation of their active metabolites.
