SLC7A5 interacts with JPH203 in a critical pharmacodynamic way by directly inhibiting the transporter, which can starve cancer cells of essential amino acids and hinder their growth, with the drug's effectiveness varying due to genetic differences in SLC7A5. Indirect interactions can also be theorized for melphalan, pregabalin, and gabapentin, where changes in amino acid transport due to variations in SLC7A5 could potentially alter the drugs' efficacy and kinetics, although these interactions are more speculative compared to the direct action of JPH203.
