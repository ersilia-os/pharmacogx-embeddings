Variants in the F2 gene, such as the G20210A polymorphism (rs1799963), result in increased prothrombin levels and influence the effectiveness of anticoagulants like warfarin, which requires dose adjustments in affected patients to manage bleeding risks. While the drugs lusutrombopag and avatrombopag could interact with prothrombin activity, and tamoxifen may exacerbate thrombotic risks in patients with F2 mutations, the specific pharmacogenetic interactions of these drugs with the F2 gene are not well-established and require further validation.
