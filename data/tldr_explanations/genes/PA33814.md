The PRPF31 gene, while essential in pre-mRNA splicing, does not directly influence the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of common therapeutic drugs, such as metformin. However, metformin's potential neuroprotective benefits in diseases with neural degeneration—like retinitis pigmentosa associated with PRPF31 mutations—highlight an indirect relationship where the drug’s broader therapeutic effects may be of interest in the context of such genetic conditions.
