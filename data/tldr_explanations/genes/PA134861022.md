There are no drugs currently identified that pharmacogenetically interact with the gene SULF1, but its role in regulating pathways like Hedgehog, Wnt, and FGF could affect the efficacy of pathway inhibitors used in cancer therapy, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These potential interactions are primarily pharmacodynamic, focusing on how SULF1 activity influences drug targets rather than affecting the pharmacokinetics of the drugs.
