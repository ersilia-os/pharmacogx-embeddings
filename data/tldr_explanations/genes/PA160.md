Variants in the F7 gene, associated with the production of Coagulation Factor VII, affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs like eptacog alfa and warfarin, used in treating bleeding disorders. The efficacy and safety of these treatments, such as optimizing bleeding control and reducing bleeding risks, are modified by these genetic variations, necessitating tailored administration based on individual genetic profiles to optimize outcomes and enhance patient safety.
