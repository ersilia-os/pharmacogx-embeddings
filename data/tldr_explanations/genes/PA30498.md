Dasatinib, used for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), targets LYN's kinase activity, potentially impacting drug effectiveness or toxicity through its influence on kinase-dependent cell proliferation and survival in cancer cells. Meanwhile, ziprasidone, an antipsychotic, may indirectly interact with LYN by affecting immune modulation pathways, though this interaction is less well defined than dasatinib's direct inhibition of kinase activity.
