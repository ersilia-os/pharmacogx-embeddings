Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used primarily in cancer treatment, may interact with the ABCA3 gene, which plays a crucial role in lipid transport and surfactant metabolism in the lungs. This interaction, potentially beneficial in diseases like interstitial lung disease and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, affects cellular growth and differentiation pathways influenced by ABCA3 dysfunction.
