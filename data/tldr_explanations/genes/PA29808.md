Drugs such as Anakinra, Canakinumab, and Rilonacept interact with the IL1B gene by targeting its coded product, interleukin 1 beta, to modulate inflammatory responses in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes. Genetic variations in IL1B affect the efficacy and safety of these drugs, primarily through pharmacodynamic interactions that alter therapeutic outcomes rather than pharmacokinetic changes, with other drugs like metformin, aspirin, and methotrexate having less defined, indirect interactions with IL1B related to their broad anti-inflammatory effects.
