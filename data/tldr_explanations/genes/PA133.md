The CYP11B1 gene's role in corticosteroid biosynthesis impacts the pharmacokinetics of drugs like metyrapone, which inhibits CYP11B1 to reduce cortisol production, useful in treating conditions like Cushing's syndrome. Variations in the CYP11B1 gene can affect metyrapone's effectiveness and tolerability by altering enzyme expression or activity, highlighting the importance of considering genetic differences in treatment plans involving corticosteroid imbalances.
