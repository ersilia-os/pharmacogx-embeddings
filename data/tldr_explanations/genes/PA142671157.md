The drugs docetaxel, gemcitabine, and zoledronate do not have well-established direct pharmacogenetic interactions with the gene PPCDC, which is involved in coenzyme A biosynthesis. Although these drugs are processed through pathways that might interact indirectly with metabolic routes involving coenzyme A, current research does not confirm any specific drug-gene interactions, suggesting that any impact PPCDC has on these drugs is likely due to broad metabolic effects rather than direct pharmacogenetic interactions.
