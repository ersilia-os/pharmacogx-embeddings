Eculizumab and Ravulizumab, monoclonal antibodies targeting the C5 gene, inhibit its conversion into C5a and C5b to prevent inflammatory responses and the formation of the membrane attack complex, helping treat conditions like paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, respectively. The effectiveness and safety of these drugs can vary due to genetic variations within the C5 gene, influencing patient responses and underscoring the importance of personalized medicine in treating complement system-related diseases.
