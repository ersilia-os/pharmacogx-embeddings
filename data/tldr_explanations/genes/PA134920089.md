The gene GALNT14 influences the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents such as cetuximab, mitoxantrone, sorafenib, fluorouracil, and doxorubicin by modifying mucin-type O-linked glycosylation, which affects cellular interactions and drug sensitivity. Variants and expression levels of GALNT14 serve as predictive biomarkers, impacting drug pharmacodynamics and guiding personalized chemotherapy strategies, particularly by indicating favorable prognosis and treatment outcomes in cancers like metastatic colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
