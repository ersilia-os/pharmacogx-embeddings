The interaction between the WNT5B gene and the chemotherapeutic agent fluorouracil, which disrupts RNA synthesis, may influence cancer treatment outcomes by affecting tumor cell behavior and progression. The gene's role in cellular processes via non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways, and its variations, could alter how cancer cells respond to fluorouracil, primarily impacting drug pharmacodynamics.
