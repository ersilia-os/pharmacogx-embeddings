CST5 encodes cystatin D, which inhibits cysteine proteases and could hypothetically affect the effectiveness of drugs targeting proteolytic pathways or those modulating immune responses in conditions like periodontal disease. The gene's influence on these drugs is theoretical and based on its role in protease inhibition, as direct interactions have not been documented.
