HNRNPH2, primarily involved in RNA processing, does not have a direct role in drug metabolism but may hypothetically impact the efficacy of drugs like migalastat, used in treating Fabry disease, through alterations in mRNA splicing or protein synthesis. This potential interaction with migalastat, which stabilizes mutant alpha-galactosidase A enzyme, is theoretical and would pertain to pharmacodynamics rather than pharmacokinetics.
