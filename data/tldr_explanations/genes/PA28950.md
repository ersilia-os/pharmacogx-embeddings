The gene GPX2, involved in cellular defense against oxidative stress, potentially interacts pharmacodynamically with drugs like doxorubicin which induce oxidative stress, due to its role in detoxifying reactive oxygen species. Although direct studies are lacking, understanding these interactions may be crucial for optimizing treatment strategies for conditions like inflammation or colon cancer, where oxidative damage plays a significant role.
