The RRM2B gene, crucial for DNA synthesis and repair, may affect the effectiveness and toxicity of the chemotherapy drugs cytarabine and cladribine. These nucleoside analogues, which disrupt DNA synthesis in cancer cells, may have altered pharmacodynamics due to changes in RRM2B function or expression, impacting drug integration into DNA and cytotoxic effects.
