Although GRIK2 directly affects glutamate-mediated neurotransmission and is linked to various neurological disorders, it does not have established pharmacokinetic interactions with specific drugs. However, its role in these pathways may influence how medications like citalopram, an SSRI, affect neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity indirectly, particularly in contexts where serotonin and glutamate transmissions intersect.
