The RARS gene, which encodes arginyl-tRNA synthetase, indirectly affects the efficacy of drugs like mTOR inhibitors (e.g., rapamycin) used in cancer therapy, due to its role in protein synthesis and the mTOR signaling pathway. Although the pharmacogenetic interactions between RARS gene variations and these drugs are currently hypothetical, they suggest a potential influence on the pharmacodynamics of such drugs, potentially affecting drug response based on changes in protein synthesis processes governed by RARS.
