In the context of pharmacogenetics, the gene AQP4, which is crucial for water transport in the central nervous system, does not interact directly with drugs but impacts the effectiveness of treatments for conditions like neuromyelitis optica (NMO). The understanding of individual variations in AQP4 expression or function could help optimize therapies that modulate immune activity or manage fluid balance, potentially affecting treatments for brain fluid imbalances and autoimmune attacks in NMO.
