The ANKFN1 gene, which is significant in cellular communication and signaling, might indirectly affect the efficacy or toxicity of drugs that influence cellular structuring and signaling, such as hydrochlorothiazide. Although not conclusively proven, the gene could potentially impact hydrochlorothiazide's effects by modulating cellular ion transport and fluid dynamics through its role in cellular signaling pathways.
