The drugs docetaxel, carboplatin, and paclitaxel, used in cancer treatments such as melanoma, might have varying efficacies based on the mutation status of SOX10, a gene involved in cell development and function. Although SOX10 does not directly interact with drug metabolism pathways typical in pharmacogenetics, its role in altering cell differentiation and survival pathways could indirectly affect the sensitivity or resistance of tumor cells to these anti-cancer agents.
