The NUDT15 gene is key in metabolizing thiopurine drugs such as mercaptopurine, azathioprine, and thioguanine, which are used to treat leukemias and autoimmune diseases. Genetic variants in NUDT15, like rs116855232, can lead to reduced enzyme activity, increasing the risk of severe myelosuppression and necessitating dose adjustments to avoid toxicity. This gene may also affect the metabolism of other drugs such as acyclovir and methotrexate by influencing nucleotide synthesis pathways.
