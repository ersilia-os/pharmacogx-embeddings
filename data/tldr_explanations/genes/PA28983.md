Heroin and nicotine may interact with the GRIN3A gene, which encodes a subunit of the NMDA receptor, impacting synaptic function and neurodevelopment. Heroin could affect NMDA receptor dynamics involving GRIN3A through opioid receptor activity in the CNS, while nicotine might modulate GRIN3A-mediated NMDA receptor activity, influencing neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity.
