Drugs like alkylating agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide) and platinum-based compounds (e.g., cisplatin, carboplatin), that induce DNA damage, could interact pharmacogenetically with the APLF gene, which is important in DNA repair via the non-homologous end joining pathway. These interactions could affect the drugs' efficacy and toxicity, depending on individual variations in the APLF gene that impact the body's ability to repair DNA damage, potentially leading to altered resistance or increased adverse effects.
