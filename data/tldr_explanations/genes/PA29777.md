The interactions between the IKBKG gene and antimalarial drugs such as pyrimethamine, artesunate, sulfadoxine, and primaquine are largely pharmacodynamic, affecting the NF-kappaB signaling pathway and consequently impacting the immune response needed to combat malaria. Mutations in the IKBKG gene can modify the immune system's response, thus potentially influencing the efficacy of these drugs in individuals with such genetic variations.
