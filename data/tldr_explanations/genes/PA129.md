The gene CYP2E1 significantly impacts the metabolism of various drugs; for instance, in the case of acetaminophen and isoniazid, variations in CYP2E1 activity can lead to differences in the rate at which these drugs are metabolized, thereby affecting their efficacy, toxicity, and risk of adverse effects such as hepatotoxicity. Additionally, CYP2E1 metabolizes other substances like caffeine, theophylline, nicotine, and some procarcinogens, indicating that genetic variations could influence both therapeutic outcomes and disease risk through pharmacokinetic and possibly pharmacodynamic interactions.
