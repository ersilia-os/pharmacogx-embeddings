NQO1 enzyme activity significantly influences the pharmacokinetics of various drugs, particularly in cancer treatment, through its role in bioactivation and detoxification. For instance, mitomycin C requires metabolic activation by NQO1, while drugs like doxorubicin and etoposide have their effectiveness and toxicity altered by NQO1 activity variations due to genetic polymorphisms such as the C609T variant, which drastically reduces enzyme activity. Additionally, NQO1 modulates the metabolism and detoxification pathways of other drugs, including acetaminophen, warfarin, cyclophosphamide, and fluorouracil, and interacts with non-cancer drugs like imatinib, as well as environmental toxins like benzene.
