Although specific pharmacogenetic interactions between the CSRP3 gene, which is important for cardiac muscle integrity, and direct drug interactions are not well-established, drugs like beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors used in heart failure management may have variable efficacy depending on the CSRP3 pathways, particularly since mutations in the gene can affect cardiac function and structure. This variable response due to CSRP3 integrity suggests a potential area for targeted pharmacogenetic research to optimize treatment in cardiac conditions associated with the gene.
