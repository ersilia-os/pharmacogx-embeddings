While there are no directly documented pharmacogenetic interactions between the gene ZNF211 and the ADHD medication methylphenidate, the gene's role in regulating neuronal gene expression might hypothetically affect the drug's effectiveness or patient responsiveness through pharmacodynamic mechanisms. This speculative association is based on ZNF211's function in transcriptional regulation impacting neuronal circuits or neurotransmitter systems influenced by methylphenidate, but concrete evidence is presently lacking.
