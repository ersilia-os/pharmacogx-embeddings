GRIK1, a gene encoding for a protein involved in excitatory signaling in the central nervous system, influences the pharmacodynamics of substances like ethanol and topiramate, particularly concerning alcohol dependence treatment. Topiramate's efficacy in reducing alcohol craving and consumption is modulated by genotypic variations in GRIK1, such as the rs2832407 allele, creating potential for tailored therapeutic approaches based on a patient's genetic profile.
