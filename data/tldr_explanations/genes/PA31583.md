Immunosuppressive drugs like tacrolimus and cyclosporine interact with the NFATC2 gene by inhibiting calcineurin, which prevents the activation of NFATC2, thus supressing T-cell activation essential for managing transplant rejections and autoimmune diseases. The interactions between asparaginase or methotrexate and NFATC2, though less defined, may influence T-cell function and proliferation, affecting treatment outcomes in cancer therapies.
