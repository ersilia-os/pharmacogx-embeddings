The Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) gene significantly affects the metabolism of drugs like olanzapine, influencing its pharmacokinetics through its role in xenobiotic metabolism, thereby altering the drugâ€™s clearance and efficacy. Additionally, AHR interacts with caffeine, showing an indirect pharmacodynamic interaction that could potentially affect drug metabolism and other physiological processes regulated by AHR, suggesting its impact extends beyond traditional pathways to also include pharmacodynamics with substances like caffeine.
