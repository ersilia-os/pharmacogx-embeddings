TAB2 indirectly influences the efficacy and response of drugs like gefitinib and tacrolimus through its role in NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways. Gefitinib's effectiveness in treating certain cancers may be affected by TAB2's regulation of NF-kappaB, while tacrolimus used in transplants could be impacted through TAB2's role in managing immune responses, suggesting potential pharmacodynamic interactions.
