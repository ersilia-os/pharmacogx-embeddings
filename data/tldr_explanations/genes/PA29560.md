The HTR6 gene, which encodes for the 5-Hydroxytryptamine Receptor 6, affects the efficacy and side effect profile of the antipsychotic medication risperidone, commonly used in treating schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. This interaction is likely due to genetic variations in HTR6 impacting receptor binding or signal transduction pathways, which can alter neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release, thereby influencing the pharmacodynamics of risperidone.
