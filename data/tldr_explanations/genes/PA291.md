Variations in the PTGIR gene, which encodes the prostacyclin receptor, can impact the efficacy of prostacyclin analogs such as iloprost and epoprostenol used in treating pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) by affecting how these drugs bind or stimulate the receptor, influencing both therapeutic outcomes and potential side effects. Additionally, PTGIR gene variations might modify the pharmacodynamic effects of non-prostacyclin drugs like aspirin, affecting its antiplatelet effectiveness, though this interaction is more related to the gene's physiological role rather than direct gene-drug interactions.
