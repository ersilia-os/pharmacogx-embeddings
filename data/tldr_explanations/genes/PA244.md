ABCC1, a critical gene encoding for an efflux transporter, significantly affects the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of various drugs by impacting their absorption, distribution, and elimination. Notably, it modulates the clearance of anticancer drugs like SN-38 and doxorubicin from cells, contributing to drug resistance and variability in therapeutic efficacy and toxicity, which is particularly relevant in optimizing cancer chemotherapy. Other drugs such as vincristine, methotrexate, and ritonavir, among others, also demonstrate pharmacogenetic interactions with ABCC1, affecting treatment outcomes especially in oncology.
