GADL1, involved primarily in amino acid metabolism, has a theoretical potential to interact with drugs affecting amino acid neurotransmitter pathways, but no specific drugs have yet been directly linked to modifications in GADL1 activity. The gene's expression in the kidney, liver, and pancreas hints at a potential role in influencing the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by these organs, potentially altering the bioavailability or degradation of related compounds, though specific drug interactions are still undocumented.
