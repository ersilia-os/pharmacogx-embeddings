The CCHCR1 gene, involved in keratinocyte differentiation and immune-mediated skin conditions like psoriasis, may affect the response to drugs targeting these processes, although there is no thorough documentation of specific pharmacogenetic interactions. Nevirapine, an antiretroviral drug, could possibly interact with CCHCR1 through immune modulation pathways, potentially altering the drug's efficacy or side effects in psoriasis patients, but this interaction remains speculative without further pharmacogenetic evidence.
