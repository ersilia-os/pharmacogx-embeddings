Mutations in the ATP7B gene, which encodes a copper-transporting ATPase, significantly impact the pharmacological treatments for Wilson disease by affecting the body's copper accumulation and thus the effectiveness of chelators like D-penicillamine and trientine, and zinc salts which respectively increase copper excretion and inhibit its absorption. Additionally, ATP7B gene mutations can alter the pharmacokinetic profile of the chemotherapy drug carboplatin, due to its interaction with copper metabolism, potentially requiring dose adjustments or increased monitoring for toxicity in patients.
