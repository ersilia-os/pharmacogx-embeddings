HTR3A is a gene that influences the response to certain medications by affecting serotonin signaling, important for drugs like ondansetron and granisetron used in managing nausea, as well as psychiatric medications such as paroxetine and potentially antipsychotics like clozapine. Variations in this gene can alter the effectiveness and side effects of these drugs, necessitating dosage modifications or alternative treatments based on individual genetic profiles to optimize therapeutic outcomes.
