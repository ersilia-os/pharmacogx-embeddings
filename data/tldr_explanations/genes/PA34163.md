The gene RAC2 can influence the efficacy of the chemotherapy drugs idarubicin and doxorubicin by affecting the production of reactive oxygen species, vital for the drugs' cytotoxic effects. Since RAC2 is involved in activating NADPH oxidase, which helps generate these reactive oxygen species in immune cells, any variations in this gene could impact the pharmacodynamic interaction and thereby modify the effectiveness of the drugs in killing cancer cells.
