RRM1 expression significantly influences the effectiveness of certain chemotherapy drugs; high levels of the RRM1 gene confer resistance to gemcitabine, which is used in various cancers including pancreatic and breast cancer. Conversely, lower RRM1 levels enhance responsiveness to gemcitabine, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). RRM1 also affects the pharmacokinetics of ara-CTP in leukemia treatment and potentially impacts responses to other drugs like carboplatin and cladribine, suggesting that RRM1 expression and activity should be considered in tailoring chemotherapy to improve outcomes and minimize toxicity.
