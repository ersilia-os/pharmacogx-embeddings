CYP17A1 significantly influences the effectiveness of abiraterone, a drug used in prostate cancer treatment, by inhibiting the enzyme to reduce androgen production, crucial for cancer cell growth; variations in the CYP17A1 gene may affect the drug's efficacy, requiring personalized treatment strategies. Additionally, CYP17A1 interactions with other drugs involved in conditions like Cushing's syndrome or congenital adrenal hyperplasia suggest its broader pharmacogenetic importance in managing steroid-related disorders, guiding treatment decisions to optimize outcomes and reduce side effects.
