ARF1, a GTP-binding protein involved in vesicular trafficking, could influence the effectiveness and toxicity of tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib, afatinib, and erlotinib used in cancer treatment by impacting their intracellular distribution and concentrations. Dysregulation of ARF1 may affect the pharmacokinetics of these drugs by altering their delivery and cellular exposure, which might lead to variations in therapeutic outcomes and side effects.
