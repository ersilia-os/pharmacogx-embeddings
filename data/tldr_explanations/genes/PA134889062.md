SLC9A9 influences the neuronal storage and release of neurotransmitters, which could potentially affect the pharmacodynamic properties of opioids like fentanyl and remifentanil, primarily used in anesthesia and pain management. Variants in SLC9A9 may alter neuronal responsiveness or opioid receptor dynamics, thereby impacting the drugs' efficacy or side effects profile in treating pain.
