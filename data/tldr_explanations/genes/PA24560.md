Beta-blockers and bronchodilators, which are used for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, as well as antipsychotics and dopaminergic treatments for conditions like Schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease, might interact with ADCY1 indirectly through modulation of the cAMP signaling pathway. These interactions are influenced by the pharmacodynamic role of ADCY1 in the G protein-coupled receptor signaling, rather than through direct pharmacogenetic mechanisms.
