The gene CADM2, while not directly associated with drug metabolism or response, may indirectly influence the effectiveness of medications targeting synaptic mechanisms or neurotransmitter systems due to its role in neural processes. This interaction, more pharmacodynamic than pharmacokinetic, suggests genetic variations in CADM2 could affect treatment outcomes in neuropsychiatric disorders, pointing to the potential need for personalized medicine approaches in these cases.
