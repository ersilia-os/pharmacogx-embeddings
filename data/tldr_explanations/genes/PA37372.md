CCN4 (WISP1) lacks direct, established pharmacogenetic interactions with specific drugs that alter drug metabolism or response patterns. However, due to its important roles in the WNT signaling pathway, influencing processes like cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, it is considered a potential target in diseases like fibrosis and cancer. Drugs targeting the WNT pathway might consequently affect CCN4-related pathways, impacting conditions such as tumor growth in cancers and tissue progression in fibrosis, although these interactions are speculative and not based on direct pharmacogenetic evidence.
