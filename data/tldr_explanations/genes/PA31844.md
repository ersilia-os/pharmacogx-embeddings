NUMA1, crucial in mitotic spindle assembly, may impact the efficacy of microtubule inhibitors like paclitaxel and vincristine, which halt cancer cell division by disrupting microtubule dynamics. While NUMA1's direct pharmacogenetic interactions aren't thoroughly documented, its role in cell division mechanisms suggests that any variations in its expression or mutations could modify how cancer cells respond to these drugs, primarily influencing their pharmacodynamics rather than pharmacokinetics.
