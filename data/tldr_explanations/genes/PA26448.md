The gene CHAT, critical for synthesizing acetylcholine, interacts with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as rivastigmine, donepezil, and galantamine, used in Alzheimer's disease management, by affecting their pharmacodynamics as these drugs aim to increase acetylcholine levels by preventing its breakdown. Variations in CHAT expression among individuals can amplify or modify the effects of these medications, while olanzapine, though primarily an antipsychotic, may also interact indirectly through CHAT due to its broad receptor influence on cognitive and neuromuscular systems.
