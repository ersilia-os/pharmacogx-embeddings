Drugs such as docetaxel and thalidomide, although not directly connected to the SPG7 gene through pharmacokinetics, may interact indirectly due to their effects on cellular mechanisms; docetaxel impacts cell division while thalidomide affects immune modulation. These interactions likely affect mitochondrial stress pathways in the context of SPG7 mutations, where both drugs potentially exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction.
