Variants in the CHRM1 gene, which encodes the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, alter the response to anticholinergic drugs like scopolamine and benztropine used in treating neurological disorders by affecting neurotransmitter release and neuronal excitability. Similarly, these gene variants influence the pharmacodynamic interactions of clozapine, used in schizophrenia treatment, by modifying receptor activity, which is essential for the drug's therapeutic and side effect profiles, including anticholinergic effects and potential drug-induced dystonia.
