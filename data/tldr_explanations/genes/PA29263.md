Epoetin alfa, used for anemia in chronic kidney disease, interacts with HFE gene variants, affecting iron utilization and metabolism, thereby influencing the drug's pharmacokinetics. Conversely, pazopanib, a cancer therapy drug, may have non-pharmacokinetic interactions with the HFE gene by affecting iron metabolic pathways, though the exact mechanism is less clear.
