The gene REV1 plays a crucial role in the resistance of cancer cells to platinum-based chemotherapy agents like cisplatin by facilitating DNA replication past drug-induced lesions, thus diminishing the drugs' effectiveness. Targeting REV1 activity through personalized medicine could potentially improve the efficacy of these treatments by sensitizing tumors to the drugs and reducing toxicity.
