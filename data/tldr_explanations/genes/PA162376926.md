The ASS1 gene mutation affects the efficacy and dosing of nitrogen-scavenging agents like sodium phenylbutyrate and glycerol phenylbutyrate, which are used in treating citrullinemia type 1. These drugs work by providing alternative pathways for nitrogen excretion, thereby reducing ammonia levels in patients, with glycerol phenylbutyrate potentially offering benefits like less frequent dosing due to a different pharmacokinetic profile. Additionally, the interaction between these drugs and the ASS1 gene is pharmacodynamic, aiming to enhance the reduced function of the urea cycle and prevent neurological damage.
