Drugs and gene therapies targeting the BCL11A gene aim to increase the levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) to treat hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease (SCD) and Î²-thalassemia by disrupting the gene's regulatory region using techniques like CRISPR/Cas9. This pharmacodynamic approach focuses on altering the gene's function to mitigate disease severity, showing potential in early clinical trials without involving changes in drug metabolism or pharmacokinetics.
