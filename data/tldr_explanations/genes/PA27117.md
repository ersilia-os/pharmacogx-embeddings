CYP46A1, which plays a key role in converting cholesterol to 24S-hydroxycholesterol for brain clearance, might interact indirectly with statins, which alter cholesterol levels. This interaction could potentially affect neuroprotective pharmacodynamics and the progression of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, though concrete evidence of specific pharmacogenetic interactions remains unconfirmed.
