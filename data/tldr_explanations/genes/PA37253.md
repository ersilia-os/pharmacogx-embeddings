The gene USP5 is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, important for protein turnover, potentially affecting drug interactions indirectly due to its role in proteasome functionality. For example, the drug bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, might interact indirectly with USP5 by altering the ubiquitin chains it regulates, potentially impacting the drug's effectiveness or toxicity. Other drugs, such as hydrochlorothiazide, sildenafil, and clozapine, although not directly linked to USP5, could indirectly affect or be affected by the proteasome dysfunctions and cellular stress responses associated with USP5's activity in protein degradation.
