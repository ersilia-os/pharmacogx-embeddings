The gene XYLT2 indirectly interacts with the chemotherapy drugs carboplatin and gemcitabine by influencing proteoglycan assembly in connective tissues, which may affect tissue responses during cancer treatment. Although XYLT2 does not directly alter the metabolism or effectiveness of these drugs, its role in the biosynthesis of proteoglycans could impact the repair or reaction of connective tissues to the toxicity caused by these chemotherapeutic agents.
