CYP11A1 does not directly affect the metabolism of exogenous drugs but plays a critical role in steroid biosynthesis, impacting the efficacy of drugs like certain corticosteroids and contraceptive pills through variations in endogenous steroid levels. Consequently, alterations in CYP11A1 activity may require dose adjustments in steroid-based therapies, particularly in conditions affecting hormonal balance such as adrenal insufficiency or congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).
