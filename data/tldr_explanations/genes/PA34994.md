SCGB3A1's potential tumor suppressor function in lung cancer might hypothetically influence the efficacy or response to cancer medications such as pazopanib and sunitinib, which target tyrosine kinases involved in tumor growth and angiogenesis. The effectiveness of these drugs could vary among patients with different expression levels of SCGB3A1 due to its role in modulating tumor progression or immune responses in the lung.
