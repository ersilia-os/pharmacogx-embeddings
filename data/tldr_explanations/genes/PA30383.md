LILRB5, an immunomodulatory gene expressed in cells like monocytes and natural killer cells, currently has no established pharmacogenetic interactions with specific drugs, but its role as an inhibitory receptor suggests it could potentially influence the effectiveness of drugs that modulate immune responses. This impact would predominantly affect pharmacodynamics by altering immune cell behavior, particularly in therapies targeting cancer or autoimmune diseases.
