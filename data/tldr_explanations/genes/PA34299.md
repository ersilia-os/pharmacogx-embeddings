The gene RBX1, integral to the ubiquitin-proteasome system, may influence the pharmacodynamics of anticancer agents like fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide by affecting protein degradation pathways, thereby altering how cancer cells respond to these drugs. Variations in RBX1 can lead to changes in the degradation rates of proteins targeted by chemotherapy, potentially modifying drug efficacy or toxicity due to its role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis processes.
