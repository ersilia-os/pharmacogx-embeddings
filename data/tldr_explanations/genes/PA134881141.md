TAAR6, a gene influencing neurotransmitter modulation in the brain, affects the response to the antipsychotic drug aripiprazole, commonly used in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Genetic variations in TAAR6 may alter the effectiveness or side effects of aripiprazole by affecting the neurotransmitter pathways it targets, thereby influencing patient treatment outcomes in a pharmacodynamic manner.
