The KLRD1 gene, which encodes the CD94 protein, influences the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy treatments by affecting natural killer (NK) cell activity. Variants in this gene also modify the pharmacodynamic interactions with drugs like methotrexate, potentially altering its effectiveness in conditions where NK cells are crucial, such as certain cancers and autoimmune diseases.
