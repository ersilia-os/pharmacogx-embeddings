Latanoprost, a prostaglandin analogue used in glaucoma treatment, indirectly influences PTGFR pathways through pharmacodynamic interactions due to the broad actions of prostaglandins in the eye. Additionally, NSAIDs, which modulate prostaglandin synthesis, also impact PTGFR indirectly, affecting inflammation and pain management. These interactions, however, are not direct pharmacokinetic interactions but occur through interconnected prostaglandin pathways.
