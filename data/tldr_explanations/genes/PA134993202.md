There is no direct evidence linking the TREML4 gene with specific drug interactions in terms of pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics; however, TREML4 may indirectly affect the effectiveness or side effects of the drug duloxetine, which impacts inflammatory pathways, due to the gene's role in immune modulation. This inferred interaction suggests that changes in TREML4 could indirectly influence duloxetineâ€™s therapeutic outcomes in conditions involving inflammation.
