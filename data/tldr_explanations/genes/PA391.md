NR1I3, or the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), significantly influences the metabolism of drugs such as (R)-methadone and efavirenz by modulating the enzyme CYP3A4, leading to possible adjustments in drug dosing due to its role in enhancing their metabolism. Additionally, NR1I3 affects the metabolism of drugs like docetaxel, warfarin, sunitinib, and nevirapine, potentially altering their clearance rates and efficacy through the regulation of various CYP enzymes.
