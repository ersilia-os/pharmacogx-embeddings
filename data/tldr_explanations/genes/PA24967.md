The gene ARHGEF10 may modify neuronal sensitivity to the neurotoxic effects of drugs like paclitaxel due to its role in neuronal function and structure, indicating a non-pharmacokinetic interaction that affects the drug's neurotoxicity based on individual genetic differences in nerve cell resilience. This highlights the potential for personalized medicine approaches that account for genetic susceptibility to drug-induced neurotoxicity in treating neuropathies.
