Drugs that affect calcium signaling or oxidative stress, such as calcium channel blockers or neuroprotective antioxidants, might potentially interact with the TMX2 gene, which is involved in calcium homeostasis and cellular stress responses. This potential interaction is inferred from the gene's role in neurological pathways and stress responses, and not from specific pharmacogenetic data.
