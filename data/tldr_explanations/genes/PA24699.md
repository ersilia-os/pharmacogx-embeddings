ALDH3B1, an enzyme involved in detoxifying aldehydes to carboxylic acids, potentially affects the metabolism of drugs like cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide, which produce toxic aldehyde by-products. The enzyme's efficiency in processing these intermediates can influence the pharmacokinetics, detoxification, and side effect profiles of such drugs, thereby affecting individual responses regarding toxicity or therapeutic efficacy.
