Methylphenidate, a drug used to treat ADHD, might interact with the FARP2 gene, which plays a critical role in neuronal development and synaptic function. This interaction, likely pharmacodynamic, involves the modulation of neuronal and synaptic structures influenced by FARP2, potentially affecting the drug's efficacy or safety in individuals with variations in FARP2 expression or function.
