ALDH4A1, involved in converting pyrroline-5-carboxylate to glutamate, may affect the metabolism of drugs that rely on the Krebs cycle or influence amino acid levels, particularly those used in managing metabolic disorders. Though specific drug interactions with ALDH4A1 are not well-documented, its role in critical metabolic processes suggests it could indirectly influence the pharmacokinetics of certain medications by affecting overall energy metabolism or mitochondrial function.
