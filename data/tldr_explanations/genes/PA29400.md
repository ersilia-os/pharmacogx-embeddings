HOXC13, a gene important for the development of hair and nails, may influence the pharmacodynamics of medications for dermatological conditions involving hair and nail growth or regeneration. Although specific drugs directly targeting HOXC13 are not yet known, its role suggests potential interactions in treatments for disorders like ectodermal dysplasia and skin cancers, where variations in its expression might affect treatment outcomes.
