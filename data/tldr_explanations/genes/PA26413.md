AGAP3, involved in synaptic functions and cellular transport, does not exhibit direct pharmacogenetic interactions with specific drugs such as clopidogrel and aspirin, but it may influence their effects indirectly through its role in cellular signaling and the actin cytoskeleton. This suggests that AGAP3 could affect the therapeutic outcomes or side profiles of these drugs in neurological or systemic contexts, despite no direct pharmacokinetic interactions being documented.
