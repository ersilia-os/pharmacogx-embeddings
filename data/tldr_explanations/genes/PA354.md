The gene TOP2A encodes the enzyme Topoisomerase II alpha, which is a crucial target in cancer therapy influenced by its interactions with topoisomerase inhibitors like doxorubicin and etoposide; these interactions impact drug sensitivity and resistance by affecting the enzyme's role in DNA processing. Although not directly targeted by drugs like fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide, the expression levels of TOP2A might still impact the pharmacodynamics of these chemotherapeutic agents through its involvement in cell proliferation and chromosomal mechanisms.
