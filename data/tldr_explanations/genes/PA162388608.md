FKBP15, a gene involved in protein folding and trafficking, may interact pharmacogenetically with the chemotherapy drug carboplatin, affecting the drug's impact on cell survival and death through non-pharmacokinetic mechanisms related to its role in cellular machinery. Understanding this interaction could help optimize carboplatin use by influencing treatment efficacy or managing adverse effects in patients with variations in FKBP15.
