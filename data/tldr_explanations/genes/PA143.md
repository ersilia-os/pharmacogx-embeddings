Methotrexate and pemetrexed, drugs that target DHFR (dihydrofolate reductase) crucial in folate metabolism and DNA synthesis, are influenced by variations in the DHFR gene, affecting their efficacy and safety. These variations can lead to different drug responses such as reduced effectiveness or increased toxicity, indicating a need for personalized dosing strategies to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects.
