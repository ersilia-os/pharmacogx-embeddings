The gene SLC22A11 encodes for the organic anion transporter 4 (OAT4), which significantly impacts the renal excretion of drugs such as diuretics like furosemide and thiazide, influencing their effectiveness and potential for toxicity. Alterations in SLC22A11 also affect the clearance of methotrexate, a chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressant agent, primarily through modified drug transport, which could lead to changes in its pharmacokinetic profile despite not directly influencing its metabolism.
