NUP107, essential for nuclear transport and cell cycle regulation, does not have documented direct interactions with specific drugs according to its pharmacogenetic profile. The gene's potential influence on pharmacotherapy is hypothesized to involve the distribution of drugs within cellular compartments rather than direct interactions or metabolic processes, given its role in intracellular transport, though no specific drugs have been directly linked to variations in NUP107 function.
