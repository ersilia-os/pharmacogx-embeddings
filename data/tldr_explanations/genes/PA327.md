The gene SLC19A1, which encodes a folate transporter protein, significantly influences the pharmacokinetics of antifolate medications such as methotrexate by affecting its cellular uptake, thus altering drug efficacy and toxicity. Variants in SLC19A1 can lead to differences in methotrexate transport into cells, impacting the necessity for personalized dosing strategies, and potentially affecting other similar chemotherapy drugs, although the extent of interaction may vary.
