ZNF816, or Zinc Finger Protein 816, does not currently have a defined pharmacogenetic interaction with specific drugs but is involved in DNA-binding that could theoretically impact drug responses and disease mechanisms related to genomic stability and transcription dysregulation. However, any potential effect of ZNF816 on drug metabolism, efficacy, or toxicity remains speculative without direct evidence of its involvement in pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics.
