The AS3MT gene, responsible for metabolizing inorganic arsenic, significantly influences the effectiveness and toxicity of arsenic trioxide, a drug used in treating acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Variations in the AS3MT gene affect how arsenic is metabolized and detoxified, thereby impacting the pharmacokinetics of arsenic trioxide, which determines the drug's active duration and concentration in the body.
