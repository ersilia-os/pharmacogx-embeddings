Variations in the SOCS3 gene, which modulates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway involved in immune responses, can influence the efficacy of drugs like ribavirin that have immunomodulatory effects, despite not directly targeting this pathway. This interaction is crucial for personalizing treatment plans in diseases that involve intense cytokine signaling, as it could affect the drugâ€™s effectiveness and side effect profile.
