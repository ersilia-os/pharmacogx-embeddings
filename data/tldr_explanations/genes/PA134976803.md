The gene CHST13, known for sulfating carbohydrates and impacting cell signaling and adhesion, has no confirmed pharmacogenetic interactions with specific drugs. The potential interaction with glyburide, a diabetes drug, remains speculative and theoretical, suggesting that CHST13's role in modifying cell surfaces might influence how glyburide works, though firm evidence is lacking.
