Retinoids and corticosteroids, used in treating skin conditions like psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, likely influence the expression and function of IVL (involucrin) by affecting keratinocyte differentiation and inflammatory responses, indirectly modulating the skin's structural and protective barrier. Although direct pharmacogenetic interactions of these drugs with IVL have not been established, their effects on skin physiology suggest a potential indirect impact on IVL expression and function.
