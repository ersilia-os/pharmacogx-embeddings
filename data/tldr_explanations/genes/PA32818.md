ORM2, which influences drug plasma protein binding and availability due to its role in acute phase reactions and systemic inflammation, interacts with docetaxel by potentially altering its pharmacokinetics, affecting the drug's distribution and elimination in the body. This interaction, particularly significant in inflammatory cancers like breast and prostate cancer where ORM2 could be elevated, may change docetaxel's efficacy and safety by varying its plasma concentration.
