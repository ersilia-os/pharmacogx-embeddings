Metformin, although primarily used for diabetes, may indirectly influence the activity of the SRR gene, which is crucial in synthesizing the neurotransmitter D-serine involved in schizophrenia. This indirect interaction occurs as metformin potentially affects metabolic pathways, thereby altering serine levels and possibly modulating NMDA receptor activity, critical in the pathology and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia.
