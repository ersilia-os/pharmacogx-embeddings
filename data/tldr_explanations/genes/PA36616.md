Brentuximab vedotin, a drug targeting CD30, demonstrates a pharmacogenetic interaction with the TNFRSF8 gene, where its efficacy is influenced by the variable expression levels of TNFRSF8 on tumor cells in lymphoid cancers like Hodgkin's lymphoma. Higher expression of TNFRSF8 enhances drug binding and efficacy, while lower expression or genetic alterations in TNFRSF8 may lead to reduced efficacy, highlighting the drugâ€™s pharmacodynamic implications.
