ITPA variants significantly influence the metabolism and toxicity of antiviral and antimetabolic drugs such as azathioprine, mercaptopurine, and ribavirin. In particular, they modulate side effects linked to purine analogues and reduce the risk of hemolytic anemia in patients treated with ribavirin for hepatitis C, likely by altering the metabolism of inosine triphosphate and therefore impacting the drug's activity and oxidative stress in the body.
