The LTC4S gene, which encodes leukotriene C4 synthase, plays a crucial role in the effectiveness and safety of leukotriene receptor antagonists such as montelukast and zafirlukast, used in treating asthma and allergic conditions. Genetic variations in LTC4S can influence how patients metabolize and respond to these drugs, affecting their efficacy and the risk of side effects. Meanwhile, other drugs like zileuton and aspirin interact differently with leukotriene biosynthesis, which highlights the complex interaction of LTC4S with various medications targeting the leukotriene pathway.
