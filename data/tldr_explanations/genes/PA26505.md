Although there is no well-documented evidence of specific drugs directly targeting CHST5, its role in biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans hints at potential interactions with drugs affecting the extracellular matrix, particularly in gastrointestinal treatments. Genetic variations in CHST5 could theoretically influence the efficacy or safety profiles of these drugs, given its involvement in cell adhesion and proteoglycan dynamics in the gastrointestinal tract.
