The gene MSH5, primarily involved in DNA mismatch repair during meiosis, has minimal direct interactions with most pharmaceutical drugs, primarily affecting germ rather than somatic cells. Its potential interactions are speculative with drugs like allopurinol, carboplatin, and gemcitabine - these drugs may interact with MSH5 through mechanisms related to DNA repair processes like oxidative stress, DNA crosslinks, and replication stress, which could impact the drugs' efficacy or toxicity.
