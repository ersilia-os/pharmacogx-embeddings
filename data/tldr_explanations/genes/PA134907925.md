FGD4, which plays a role in cell cytoskeleton dynamics, may interact pharmacodynamically with paclitaxel, a chemotherapeutic agent that stabilizes microtubules to inhibit cell division. Given FGD4's function in regulating cytoskeletal rearrangement through Cdc42 activation, its interaction with paclitaxel could potentially influence the drug's efficacy or toxicity, particularly in tissues where FGD4 is prominently expressed.
