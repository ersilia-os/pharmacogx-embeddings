The enzyme DBH (Dopamine Beta-Hydroxylase) plays a pivotal role in converting dopamine to norepinephrine, affecting the efficacy of various drugs by influencing their pharmacological pathways. This interaction impacts drugs like bupropion and naltrexone, used for depression and addiction, and drugs like carbidopa and levodopa for Parkinson's, as well as substances such as nicotine, cocaine, and heroin, by altering norepinephrine synthesis and catecholamine signaling, ultimately guiding the personalization of treatment in psychiatric and cardiovascular care.
