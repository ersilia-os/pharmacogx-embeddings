Variations in the GRM3 gene can affect the effectiveness and side effects of antipsychotic drugs such as risperidone and olanzapine, used primarily for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, by altering the receptor interactions that influence neural excitability and synaptic plasticity. Additionally, drugs like methamphetamine, which impact dopamine levels in the brain, may interact with GRM3 variants, affecting the drugs' efficacy and risk profiles due to indirect effects on glutamatergic systems.
