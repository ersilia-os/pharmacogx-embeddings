Genetic variations in ALDH1A3 can significantly affect the metabolism of retinoic acid, impacting the efficacy and safety of drugs like all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), used for treating acute promyelocytic leukemia. If ALDH1A3 function is compromised, it could lead to altered synthesis of retinoic acid, variably affecting drug response and increasing the risk of adverse effects, making ALDH1A3 a potential target for personalized retinoid therapies.
