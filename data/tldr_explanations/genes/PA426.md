The gene SLC28A3, which is vital for the transport of nucleoside and nucleotide analog drugs, significantly impacts the pharmacokinetics of these medications by affecting their absorption, distribution, and elimination. Specifically, it transports ara-CTP, the active metabolite of cytarabine (used in cancer chemotherapy), into cells, influencing the drug's efficacy and toxicity. This interaction suggests that variations in SLC28A3 could lead to different treatment outcomes in patients, potentially affecting the therapeutic dosing of other similar drugs used in treatments for cancers and viral infections.
