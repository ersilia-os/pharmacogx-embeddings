Ecallantide and icatibant are drugs that interact with the F12 gene's influence on the kallikrein-kinin system; ecallantide inhibits plasma kallikrein, reducing bradykinin production, while icatibant blocks bradykinin receptors, moderating its effects. This pharmacodynamic interaction offers therapeutic benefits particularly in conditions like hereditary angioedema and could help manage thromboembolic events without increasing bleeding risks, as typical with traditional anticoagulants.
