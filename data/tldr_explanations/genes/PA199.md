Variants of the IL13 gene affect the response to corticosteroids and the effectiveness of targeted treatments like lebrikizumab in asthma and allergic conditions, with these drugs interacting directly with the IL13 pathway, primarily affecting the JAK-STAT signaling. Drugs such as imatinib and sunitinib, used primarily in cancer therapy, may also interact with IL13 through mechanisms involving immune response modulation, related to their effects on similar cellular signaling pathways.
