ARHGAP12 regulates Rho-type GTPases affecting cell motility and morphology, with implications in diseases like cancer metastasis and neurological disorders. The interaction of ARHGAP12 with methylphenidate, used for treating ADHD, is speculative but theorized to impact neural cytoskeletal configurations and neurotransmission due to ARHGAP12â€™s functions, though explicit evidence is needed to confirm this interaction in clinical settings.
