Variations in the PIK3R1 gene can significantly affect the efficacy and toxicity of anticancer drugs like copanlisib, idelalisib, omipalisib, and everolimus, which target the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, with these interactions being primarily pharmacodynamic in nature. This is due to the role of the gene in cellular growth, survival, and proliferation, influencing how tumors respond to these drugs.
