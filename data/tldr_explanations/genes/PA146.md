Variations or mutations in the DPYS gene can lead to diminished enzyme function, which causes reduced catabolism of fluoropyrimidine-based drugs such as 5-fluorouracil and capecitabine. This decreased breakdown results in higher levels of toxic metabolites, significantly increasing the risk of severe side effects like neurotoxicity and bone marrow suppression for patients using these cancer treatments.
