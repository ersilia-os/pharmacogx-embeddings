The IL2RA gene, which encodes the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain impacting T-cell function, interacts with drugs like basiliximab and daclizumab. These monoclonal antibodies are used to prevent organ rejection by blocking IL-2-mediated T-cell activation, and variations in IL2RA may affect the efficacy and tolerability of these treatments. Methotrexate, used in managing autoimmune conditions, does not directly interact with IL2RA but may have a synergistic effect on immune responses when used in combination with immunotherapies targeting IL2RA.
