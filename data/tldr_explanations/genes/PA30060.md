Mutations in the KCNK3 gene, which affect potassium ion flow, influence the effectiveness of drugs like candesartan in treating pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Since candesartan interacts with potassium channels and, thus, with the KCNK3 gene, its efficacy might vary among patients depending on their specific KCNK3 mutations, potentially affecting PAH symptoms either positively or negatively.
