Allopurinol, used for treating gout by reducing uric acid levels, does not have a direct pharmacokinetic interaction with NOTCH4, a gene involved in immune system regulation. However, there could be a pharmacodynamic interaction where NOTCH4 genetic variations influence the efficacy of allopurinol in modulating inflammatory responses in diseases like gout or rheumatoid arthritis, affecting drug efficacy or disease progression rather than altering drug metabolism or clearance.
