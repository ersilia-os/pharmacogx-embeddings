Mexiletine and flecainide, both sodium channel blockers, pharmacogenetically interact with the SCN4A gene, which encodes the Nav1.4 sodium channel vital for muscle function. Mexiletine is used to reduce muscle hyperexcitability in myotonia congenita by blocking these sodium channels, with varying effectiveness based on specific SCN4A gene variants. Flecainide, primarily for cardiac arrhythmias, is occasionally used to decrease muscle excitability in SCN4A-related conditions, though its use requires caution due to possible cardiac side effects. Both drugs focus on modulating Nav1.4 channel activity influenced by SCN4A mutations, without altering drug levels in the body.
