PNOC gene variations, which affect nociceptin production and function, may impact the pharmacodynamic interactions of opioids like buprenorphine and methadone, used for pain management and opioid addiction treatment, by modulating their effects at opioid receptors. These interactions could influence the efficacy and safety of these drugs, necessitating potential dose adjustments or careful monitoring in patients with different PNOC genetic profiles.
