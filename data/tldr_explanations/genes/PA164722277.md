METTL14 affects the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation pathway which influences mRNA stability and gene expression. Though not directly targeted by existing drugs, its role in modifying gene expression dynamics has implications in cancer therapy, particularly in diseases like acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where drugs that indirectly affect this pathway might change treatment efficacy. Understanding these interactions could enhance therapeutic approaches by targeting RNA methylation involved in cancer.
