Belimumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting BAFF, is used to treat autoimmune disorders like Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) by reducing B cell survival and proliferation. The effectiveness of belimumab can be influenced by genetic variations in the TNFSF13B gene, which encodes BAFF, as these variations can affect the drug's interaction with BAFF and its receptors, potentially altering the therapeutic response.
