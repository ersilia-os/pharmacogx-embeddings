The gene MOB3B, involved in kinase signaling pathways, could theoretically affect the effectiveness and safety of kinase inhibitors such as Imatinib, Dasatinib, and Sorafenib, used in cancer therapy. However, there is currently no direct evidence showing how MOB3B specifically alters the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of these drugs.
