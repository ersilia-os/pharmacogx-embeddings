STN1 (OBFC1) is essential for telomere maintenance, influencing the effectiveness of drugs targeting telomerase or telomere function due to its role in the CST complex and telomeric DNA replication. While not directly involved in drug metabolism, variations in STN1 can affect the action of these drugs, with atenolol mentioned as having a possible indirect pharmacogenetic interaction via stress response pathways that could impact telomere integrity and aging.
