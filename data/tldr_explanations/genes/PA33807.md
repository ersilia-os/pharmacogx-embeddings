PROM1 (CD133) has no confirmed direct pharmacogenetic interactions with specific drugs, but its role as a marker for cancer stem cells suggests it may indirectly impact the efficacy of various chemotherapeutic agents. This influence is connected to pharmacodynamics, based on PROM1's involvement in tumor biology and stem cell characteristics, potentially affecting chemotherapy resistance and treatment outcomes in cancers expressing this gene.
