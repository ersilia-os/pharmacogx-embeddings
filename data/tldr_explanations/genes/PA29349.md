HNF4A, a transcription factor, influences the pharmacokinetics of drugs like rosuvastatin, efavirenz, and lamotrigine, where variations in HNF4A can alter drug metabolism, affecting their effectiveness and safety. Furthermore, HNF4A may affect the pharmacodynamics of drugs such as metformin, warfarin, docetaxel, and irinotecan by altering gene expression that impacts metabolic enzymes and pathways, thereby modifying drug efficacy and patient response.
