ATP5F1E, responsible for encoding a subunit crucial for ATP production in mitochondria, does not directly interact with drugs like methotrexate. Methotrexate, known for its effects on folate metabolism and cellular replication in cancer therapy and autoimmune diseases, might affect ATP5F1E function indirectly by impairing mitochondrial function, which could exacerbate energy deficits, especially in cells already facing mitochondrial dysfunction.
