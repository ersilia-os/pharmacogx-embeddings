The drug Maraviroc effectively treats HIV by blocking the CCR5 receptor on T-cells and macrophages, mimicking the protective effect of the CCR5-Delta32 mutation which naturally confers resistance to HIV. The presence of this mutation influences the effectiveness of Maraviroc, making genetic testing crucial to optimize treatment for individuals with R5-tropic HIV strains.
