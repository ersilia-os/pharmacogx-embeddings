The CFLAR gene, due to its role in regulating apoptosis, is important in pharmacogenetics, especially concerning cancer therapy. Allopurinol, although chiefly used for gout by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, might indirectly impact CFLAR's regulatory functions over cell survival pathways such as extrinsic apoptosis and NF-kB signaling. This suggests that variations in CFLAR could influence the efficacy of treatments that aim to induce apoptosis, highlighting its potential in personalized medicine strategies for cancer treatment.
