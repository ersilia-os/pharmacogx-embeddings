In the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), drugs such as dasatinib, imatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib, which are tyrosine kinase inhibitors, interact with the ABI1 gene. ABI1 functions as an adaptor protein for ABL tyrosine kinase, affecting cancer cell motility and metastasis, and variations in ABI1 can modify the efficacy of these inhibitors by influencing kinase activity and cellular responses in cancer therapy.
