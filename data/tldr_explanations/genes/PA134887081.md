There are no established pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions identified between the gene COL26A1 and the drugs citalopram or aspirin, despite the gene's association with collagen synthesis and expression in the inner ear. Current research does not support a direct link between these drugs and COL26A1, and there is only theoretical speculation about potential impacts on drug responses involving ear or connective tissues.
