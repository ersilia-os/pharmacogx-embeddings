Methamphetamine induces neurotoxic effects through the activation of NMDA receptors, which include the GRIN1 subunit, leading to excitotoxicity due to excessive glutamate release and receptor activation. Genetic variations in GRIN1 can influence individual susceptibility to methamphetamine's neurotoxic effects, potentially affecting the severity of outcomes in individuals abusing the drug.
