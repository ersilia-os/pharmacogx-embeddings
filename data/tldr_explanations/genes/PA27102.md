CYP2A7, a lesser-known member of the cytochrome P450 family, does not have well-established pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs like mercaptopurine, although it might theoretically affect mercaptopurine's metabolism similarly to its related isoform, CYP2A6. The interaction and impact of CYP2A7 on the metabolism of mercaptopurine are speculative and require further evidence, as mercaptopurine is primarily metabolized through other pathways involving TPMT and XO.
