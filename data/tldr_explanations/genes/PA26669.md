CNNM2, a gene involved in magnesium homeostasis, indirectly interacts with mercaptopurine, a leukemia treatment drug, potentially influencing its metabolism through changes in magnesium levels, which affect enzyme activities responsible for drug metabolism. While the exact mechanism is unclear, alterations in CNNM2 could impact how mercaptopurine is metabolized by affecting cellular magnesium levels and enzyme functions.
