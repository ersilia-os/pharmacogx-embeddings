The IGF2-AS gene, by modulating IGF2 expression through its antisense RNA, influences the effectiveness and safety of drugs like growth hormone replacements and insulin therapies which target the insulin-like growth factor pathway. Alterations in IGF2-AS can lead to varied responses to these treatments, necessitating adjustments in drug dosages and approaches to maximize efficacy and minimize adverse effects in conditions like growth hormone deficiencies and diabetes.
