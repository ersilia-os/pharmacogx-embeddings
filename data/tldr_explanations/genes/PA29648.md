Ribavirin, an antiviral drug used against hepatitis C and other viruses, interacts with the IFIT1 gene, predominantly influencing immune responses rather than affecting the drugâ€™s metabolism or distribution. This interaction may enhance ribavirin's antiviral efficacy through IFIT1's role in inhibiting viral replication, suggesting potential for more personalized treatment approaches based on IFIT1 expression levels in patients.
