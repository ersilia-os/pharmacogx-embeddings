The CHST1 gene, which influences the structure and function of various tissues by regulating the sulfation of keratan, potentially affects the efficacy of drugs like imatinib that interact with the extracellular matrix. While the direct pharmacogenetic interaction between CHST1 and imatinib is speculative, CHST1's role in modifying the extracellular matrix components may play a role in how such drugs perform in certain biological environments.
