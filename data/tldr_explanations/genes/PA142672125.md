Variants in the CEP72 gene, such as rs924607, are linked to an increased risk of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment. CEP72 affects the pharmacodynamics of vincristine by influencing how the drug impacts nerve cells, thereby serving as a biomarker to predict and manage this adverse effect, potentially guiding dose adjustments.
