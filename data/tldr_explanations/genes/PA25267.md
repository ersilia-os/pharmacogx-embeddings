EHMT2, which plays a key role in epigenetic regulation by methylating histone H3, indirectly interacts with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors used in cancer treatment. Variations in EHMT2 may influence the efficacy of these inhibitors, suggesting a pharmacodynamic interaction that could affect patient responses and treatment personalization, although direct evidence of this interaction is lacking.
