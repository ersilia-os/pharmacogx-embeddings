GALNT18 encodes for the enzyme polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 18, which is involved in the critical process of O-linked glycosylation affecting the stability and functional properties of proteins. While there are no current direct associations with specific drugs, the role of GALNT18 in glycosylation could potentially influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of biologic drugs that require glycosylation, potentially affecting their efficacy, toxicity, and clearance rates.
