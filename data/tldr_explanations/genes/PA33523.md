TENT4A's involvement in RNA metabolic processes may indirectly affect the efficacy of gemcitabine, a nucleoside analog used in cancer therapy that incorporates into RNA to inhibit DNA synthesis. The gene's role in regulating mRNA stability and processing can potentially impact the effectiveness of RNA-targeting drugs like gemcitabine, potentially altering drug pharmacodynamics by influencing RNA-related functions in cancer cells.
