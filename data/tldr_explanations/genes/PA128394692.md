Heroin, amisulpride, and methamphetamine, which all impact the central nervous system, might theoretically interact with the ANKS1B gene, implicated in synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions. While direct pharmacokinetic interactions with ANKS1B are not established, the potential pharmacodynamic effects (biochemical and physiological actions) of these drugs could be influenced by ANKS1B's roles in neuronal signaling, connectivity, and function, particularly due to the gene's relevance in neurodevelopmental disorders like autism and schizophrenia.
