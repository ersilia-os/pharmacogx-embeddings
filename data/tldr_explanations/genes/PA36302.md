Variations in the TACR1 gene, which influences tachykinin receptor 1 involved in neuronal excitability and immune responses, can affect the effectiveness and side effects of its antagonists, such as aprepitant and fosaprepitant, used for managing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. This genetic variation primarily impacts the pharmacodynamics of these drugs, affecting how they influence the body, which is critical for personalizing treatment in conditions like migraines and neuropathic pain where TACR1 plays a significant role.
