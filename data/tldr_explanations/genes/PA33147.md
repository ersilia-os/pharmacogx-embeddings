The pharmacogenetics of the PDGFRA gene impact the efficacy and resistance of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like imatinib and avapritinib, particularly in the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). The mutations in PDGFRA determine how these drugs interact with the gene, with certain mutations enhancing drug efficacy while others lead to resistance, necessitating the use of alternative TKIs or treatment strategies.
