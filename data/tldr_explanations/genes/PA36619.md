TNFSF11, which encodes RANKL involved in bone metabolism, interacts pharmacodynamically with denosumab, leading to variable treatment responses or side effects like osteonecrosis of the jaw. Aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole and letrozole, though not directly affecting TNFSF11, indirectly influence bone metabolism by reducing estrogen levels and possibly altering RANKL expression, affecting osteoclast activity and bone integrity.
