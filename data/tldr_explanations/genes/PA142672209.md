CAMK2N1, which inhibits the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), may influence the pharmacodynamics of drugs that modulate CaMKII's activity, such as oxaliplatinâ€”a chemotherapy drug. Although not directly proven, oxaliplatin's effects on apoptosis and reactive oxygen species generation could intersect with CaMKII pathways controlled by CAMK2N1, impacting drug effects, particularly in environments of synaptic and cellular calcium homeostasis.
