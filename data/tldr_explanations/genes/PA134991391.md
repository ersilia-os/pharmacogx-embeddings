CEP68 is crucial for regulating the cell cycle and centrosome function, and while its interactions with aspirin are mentioned and remain vaguely understood, it suggests aspirin might influence pathways involved in cellular inflammation responses or cell cycle effects indirectly related to CEP68. Furthermore, due to CEP68's role in the cell cycle, potential pharmacogenetic interactions with anticancer drugs targeting mitotic machinery are suggested but remain unexplored.
