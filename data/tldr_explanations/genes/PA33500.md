Variants in the POLG gene, responsible for mitochondrial DNA replication and repair, can lead to severe complications when combined with the antiepileptic drug valproic acid, especially in patients with mitochondrial disorders. This pharmacodynamic interaction is due to valproic acid exacerbating mitochondrial dysfunction caused by POLG mutations, resulting in increased risk of acute liver failure.
