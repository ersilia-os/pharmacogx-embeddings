IL9, a gene encoding Interleukin 9, does not directly interact with many common drugs but is a target for monoclonal antibodies in conditions like asthma, aiming to modulate its activity and reduce inflammation and mucus production. This therapeutic approach focuses on the pharmacodynamics of altering IL9's pathway to improve disease outcomes, rather than influencing pharmacokinetics processes.
