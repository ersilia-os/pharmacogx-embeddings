The KCNQ1 gene, through its encoded Kv7.1 potassium channel, plays a crucial role in cardiac repolarization; variability in this gene can predispose individuals to drug-induced arrhythmias, notably Long QT Syndrome (LQT). Drugs such as epirubicin and fluorouracil, known to potentially prolong the QT interval, may have pharmacodynamic interactions with KCNQ1, increasing arrhythmia risk, while the interactions of metabolic drugs like metformin and rosiglitazone with KCNQ1 are less clear and might indirectly affect cardiac health.
