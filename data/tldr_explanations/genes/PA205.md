The ITGB3 gene, which codes for the Integrin Subunit Beta 3, influences the efficacy of the antiplatelet drugs clopidogrel and aspirin by affecting platelet aggregation mechanisms. Genetic variations in ITGB3 can lead to reduced effectiveness of these drugs, necessitating possible adjustments in dosing or alternative treatments to prevent thrombotic events like myocardial infarction or stroke.
