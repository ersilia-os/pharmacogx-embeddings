Mycophenolic acid, mycophenolate mofetil, ribavirin, and azathioprine interact with the IMPDH2 gene by inhibiting it, affecting lymphocyte proliferation, viral replication, and the treatment of autoimmune diseases, whereas tacrolimus does not inhibit IMPDH2 but is relevant in the context of its general role in immunosuppressive therapy. Variations in the IMPDH2 gene can affect the effectiveness and toxicity of these drugs, which is relevant in tailoring individual treatment plans based on pharmacodynamic properties.
