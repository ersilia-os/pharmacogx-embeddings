Variants in the SULT1A2 gene affect the metabolism of drugs such as endoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen, which are key metabolites of tamoxifen used in treating estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, by influencing their transformation and thereby impacting therapeutic efficacy and safety. This gene's activity not only impacts drug efficacy but also the risk of drug-induced toxicity, with polymorphisms affecting drug levels and patient responses, highlighting the importance of personalized dosing in cancer therapy.
