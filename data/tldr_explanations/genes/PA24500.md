Genetic variations in the ACYP2 gene, which is expressed in muscle and nerve tissues, can impact the efficacy and side effects of anticonvulsant drugs by altering pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics through its role in neuronal energy metabolism and excitability. Moreover, these variations also potentially affect the pharmacodynamics of the chemotherapeutic agent oxaliplatin, influencing its efficacy or neurotoxicity by altering energy metabolism pathways.
