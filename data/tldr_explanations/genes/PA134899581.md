Drugs like amiodarone, metformin, warfarin, clopidogrel, tacrolimus, simvastatin, and capecitabine may influence or be influenced by the metabolic pathways regulated by the BCKDK enzyme, which governs the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). For example, metformin and statins such as simvastatin could affect metabolic processes related to BCAA metabolism, impacting how these drugs interact at a pharmacodynamic level, though not directly altering pharmacokinetics through the BCKDK pathway.
