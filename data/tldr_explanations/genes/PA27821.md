EPHA5, while not directly interacting with a wide range of drugs, plays a role in cancer therapy by possibly affecting tumor response or resistance mechanisms, particularly through indirect modulation of the efficacy of paclitaxel in treating cancers like breast and lung. This interaction is non-pharmacokinetic, focusing on the gene's impact on the effectiveness and dynamics of kinase signaling pathways rather than on drug metabolism.
