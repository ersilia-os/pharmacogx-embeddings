Variants in the OAS1 gene affect patient responses to interferon-alpha in treating hepatitis C, enhancing the benefits of this treatment due to its interaction with the drug's antiviral mechanisms. Although ribavirin does not interact directly with OAS1, its efficacy in combination with interferon-alpha may be influenced by OAS1's role in viral RNA degradation, making the OAS1 genotype significant in optimizing treatment outcomes with interferon-alpha and ribavirin therapy.
