The SLCO1B1 gene, which facilitates the hepatic uptake of drugs, exhibits polymorphisms like c.521T>C that affect the pharmacokinetics of multiple drugs including statins, repaglinide, and rifampin, potentially leading to increased drug plasma concentrations, altered efficacy, and toxicity. This variability in drug transport efficiency necessitates adjustments in dosing to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects for drugs such as simvastatin, atorvastatin, and others.
