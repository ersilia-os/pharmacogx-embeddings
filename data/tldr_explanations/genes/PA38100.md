Variability in the TUBB1 gene, which plays a role in platelet formation and function, affects the efficacy and safety of antiplatelet drugs like aspirin and clopidogrel by altering platelet reactivity and clinical responses, suggesting a need for personalized antiplatelet therapy. Additionally, TUBB1 might influence the therapeutic effects of drugs such as anastrozole, cabazitaxel, and exemestane through mechanisms related to cellular microtubule modifications, impacting drug sensitivity and resistance indirectly via structural cellular dynamics.
