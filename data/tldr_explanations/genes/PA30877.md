Variations in the MMP2 gene can affect the efficacy and safety of MMP inhibitors used in cancer therapy to prevent tumor spread by targeting the degradation of matrices crucial for tumor mobility. The drug ulinastatin, while not a direct MMP inhibitor, may indirectly influence MMP2 activity or moderate the inflammatory response associated with MMP2, impacting its effectiveness in conditions like pancreatitis or postoperative settings.
