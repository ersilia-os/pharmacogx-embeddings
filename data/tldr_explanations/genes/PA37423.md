Variants in the XRCC4 gene can affect the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents like docetaxel and fluorouracil, which are used in treating cancers such as breast and gastric cancers. Docetaxel stabilizes microtubules to prevent cell division, while fluorouracil inhibits DNA synthesis by targeting thymidylate synthase; XRCC4 involvement in DNA repair influences the response to the DNA damage caused by these drugs, highlighting its critical role in pharmacodynamic interactions.
