The interaction between the gene PPM1A and the antidepressant nortriptyline primarily involves PPM1Aâ€™s regulatory role in cellular signaling pathways involving MAP kinase proteins like p38 and JNK, which may affect neuronal survival and stress responses. This interaction potentially impacts the efficacy and side effect profile of nortriptyline, although the connection remains speculative without extensive direct evidence.
