Corticosteroids and NSAIDs influence the activity of NFKB1, a gene central to inflammation and immune responses, by inhibiting its nuclear translocation and reducing gene expression, thereby managing inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. TNF inhibitors also modulate this pathway by blocking TNF-induced activation of NF-kappa-B, beneficial in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, while the typical antipsychotic flupenthixol may indirectly affect NFKB1 through its anti-inflammatory properties.
