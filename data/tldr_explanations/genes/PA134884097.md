RABEP1, while not directly interacting with drugs in altering pharmacokinetics, plays an indirect role in affecting the intracellular concentrations and therapeutic efficacies of certain psychiatric drugs like clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, aripiprazole, and valproic acid. This influence occurs through its function in endocytic vesicle trafficking, which could modify the availability and function of drug receptors, thus impacting the drugs' efficacy and side effect profiles, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.
