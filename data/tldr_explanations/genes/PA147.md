Drugs such as Fenoldopam directly stimulate DRD1, which is involved in neurotransmission and neuropsychiatric disorders, by activating adenylyl cyclase to increase cAMP levels; whereas other drugs like bupropion, dextroamphetamine, nicotine, and clozapine may indirectly influence DRD1 signaling by affecting associated dopamine pathways. Genetic variations in the DRD1 gene can modify the response to these drugs and their efficacy or adverse effects in treating conditions like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and Parkinson's disease.
