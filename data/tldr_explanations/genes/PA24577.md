Variants of the ADH7 gene can significantly affect the metabolism of ethanol, leading to variations in alcohol tolerance, risk of alcohol dependence, and susceptibility to alcohol-related disorders, due to differences in blood alcohol concentration and duration of alcohol's effects. Additionally, ADH7 involvement in the metabolism of retinol to retinoic acid suggests potential alterations in the pharmacokinetics of medications affecting the vitamin A pathways, although this specific interaction requires further verification.
