The CYB5R3 gene is involved in drug metabolism, catalyzing the reduction of methemoglobin back to hemoglobin, which is crucial for the metabolism of drugs like Aniline Dyes, Benzocaine, Dapsone, and Primaquine. These drugs can cause Methemoglobinemia particularly when CYB5R3 function is compromised due to genetic mutations or if the enzymeâ€™s metabolic capacity is overwhelmed, leading to impaired oxygen transport and delivery in affected individuals.
