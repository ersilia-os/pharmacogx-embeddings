Although there are currently no documented direct pharmacogenetic interactions between ME3, a gene involved in metabolic processes, and specific drugs, its role in lipid biosynthesis and energy production suggests that it might interact with drugs affecting metabolic disorders such as diabetes or obesity. This potential interaction could primarily be relevant to drugs that modify metabolic pathways, like antidiabetic medications or lipid-lowering agents, wherein ME3 gene variations could influence drug efficacy or patient response.
