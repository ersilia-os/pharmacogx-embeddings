SUMO4, a gene involved in immune regulation via the NF-κB pathway, affects tacrolimus, an immunosuppressive drug used in organ transplantation, by potentially altering its efficacy or toxicity due to its role in modulating NF-κB activity. Variations in SUMO4 might also impact the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, influencing drug levels and the effectiveness of immune suppression, suggesting the importance of considering genetic variants of SUMO4 in optimizing therapy with tacrolimus and possibly other similar drugs.
