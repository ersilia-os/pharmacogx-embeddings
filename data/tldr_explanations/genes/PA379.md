Perchlorate and thiocyanate, which inhibit the Sodium/Iodide Cotransporter (NIS) encoded by the SLC5A6 gene, interfere with iodide uptake in thyroid cells. This interaction impacts the pharmacokinetics of iodide, modifying thyroid hormone synthesis, and can influence the management of thyroid disorders based on genetic variations in SLC5A6.
