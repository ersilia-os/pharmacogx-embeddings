Biologics such as secukinumab and ixekizumab, which target IL-17 to treat inflammatory conditions like psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, interact pharmacodynamically with genetic variants of the IL17A gene. This interaction affects the drugs' efficacy and the occurrence of adverse effects, as certain IL17A polymorphisms can influence how effectively these drugs inhibit the IL-17 pathway.
