Variations in the FSHR gene significantly influence individual responses to drugs like Follitropin alfa and Follitropin beta, synthetic forms of FSH used in fertility treatments, requiring adjustments in drug dosage or treatment choices based on genetic differences. Similarly, drugs like thyrotropin alfa and urofollitropin, which act on hormonal pathways, may also exhibit altered efficacy or safety in patients with specific FSHR genetic variants, highlighting the importance of genetic profiling in optimizing therapeutic outcomes in reproductive and hormonal therapies.
