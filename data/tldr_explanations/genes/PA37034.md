The TSC1 gene modulates the mTOR signaling pathway, and its mutations impact the activity of mTOR inhibitors like everolimus and sirolimus, which are used to treat tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). The efficacy of these drugs varies depending on specific TSC1 gene mutations, influencing how effectively the drugs can control the disease by targeting the overactive mTORC1 complex caused by defective TSC1. Aspirin's interaction with TSC1 or mTOR pathways is less clear and not well-established in the pharmacogenetic context.
