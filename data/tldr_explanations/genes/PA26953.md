CSNK1E may influence the response to treatments targeting tau phosphorylation in Alzheimer's disease due to its role in phosphorylating tau and other key proteins. Additionally, while direct mechanisms are unclear, CSNK1E could potentially affect the pharmacodynamics of psychoactive drugs like heroin, amphetamine, and methamphetamine, influencing their effects or side effects via its regulatory role in the central nervous system and its impact on circadian rhythms and mood disorders.
