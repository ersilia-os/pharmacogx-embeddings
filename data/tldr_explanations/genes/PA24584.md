ADORA2A, which encodes the adenosine A2a receptor, critically impacts the modulation of dopamine and glutamate, influencing the effectiveness of drugs like caffeine in neuropsychiatric conditions such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. Variations in ADORA2A alter individual responses to caffeine, affecting its psychoactive effects and its potential utility in disease treatment due to differing sensitivities or tolerances linked to specific polymorphisms.
