HSPA5, known for its role in protein folding and cellular stress response in the ER, has been linked to drug resistance mechanisms, particularly with bortezomibâ€”a proteasome inhibitor used to treat cancers like multiple myeloma. The overexpression of HSPA5 can facilitate cancer cell survival under stress induced by bortezomib, thereby reducing the drug's effectiveness, a phenomenon that underscores the importance of its pharmacodynamic interactions rather than pharmacokinetic interactions.
