The gene SUGP1, which plays a key role in mRNA splicing, may affect the effectiveness or safety of fenofibrate, a drug used to treat hypercholesterolemia, through potential alterations in the splicing of fenofibrate's target genes. This influence is likely due to changes in mRNA processing rather than the pharmacokinetics of the drug itself.
