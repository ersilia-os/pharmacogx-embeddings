The CYP2C8 gene plays a crucial role in metabolizing various medications such as paclitaxel, pioglitazone, repaglinide, and amodiaquine, affecting their efficacy and toxicity due to genetic variations that influence drug metabolism and exposure. These interactions, involving pharmacokinetic processes, suggest that CYP2C8 genetic testing could be utilized to optimize drug dosing and reduce toxicity.
