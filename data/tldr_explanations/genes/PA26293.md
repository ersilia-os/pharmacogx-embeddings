Methadone and methotrexate potentially interact with the gene CDH2 (N-cadherin) in a non-pharmacokinetic fashion that might influence tissue characteristics and cellular environment. Methadone may affect neuronal connections, and methotrexate could alter cell adhesion properties relevant to cancer metastasis and cellular architectures, impacting the pharmacodynamics of these drugs concerning tissue response.
