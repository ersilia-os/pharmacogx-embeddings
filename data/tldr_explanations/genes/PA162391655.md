The HSD17B11 gene, involved in steroid hormone metabolism, may impact the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs influencing steroid pathways. Specifically, variations in HSD17B11 could affect the metabolism and efficacy of corticosteroids and oral contraceptives, potentially altering their effectiveness and increasing adverse effects, due to changes in the hormonal balance these drugs aim to control.
