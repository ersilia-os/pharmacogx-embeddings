Drugs like SSRIs (e.g., citalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine), SNRIs (e.g., fluvoxamine, duloxetine), antipsychotics (e.g., quetiapine, lurasidone, risperidone, olanzapine, haloperidol, amisulpride, clozapine), the serotonergic system modulator milnacipran, and the stimulant methamphetamine are influenced by genetic variations in the HTR1A gene, which encodes for serotonin receptor 1A. These variations affect the drugs' effectiveness and side effects by altering the interaction of these medications with the serotonin system, thereby influencing mood, anxiety, and behavioral responses.
