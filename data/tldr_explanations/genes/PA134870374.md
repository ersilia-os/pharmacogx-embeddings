The gene SLC22A15, from the solute carrier family, is mainly expressed in the brain and testis, suggesting it could potentially influence the pharmacokinetics of neurological medications and drugs affecting reproductive health by affecting their transport across cell membranes. However, there are currently no specific drugs known to interact pharmacogenetically with SLC22A15, leaving its exact role in drug interactions speculative without direct evidence.
