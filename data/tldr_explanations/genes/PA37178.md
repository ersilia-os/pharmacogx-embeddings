Variations in the UGT1A3 gene, critical for the glucuronidation process, influence the metabolism and clinical effects of drugs such as atorvastatin, deferasirox, telmisartan, valproic acid, methotrexate, and montelukast. These interactions can alter drug clearance, efficacy, side effects, and toxicity, highlighting the importance of considering genetic factors in drug dosing and therapy optimization.
