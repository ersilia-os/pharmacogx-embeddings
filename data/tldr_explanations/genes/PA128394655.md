TRAT1, involved in T-cell receptor signaling, may influence individual responses to the antipsychotic drug clozapine, primarily used in treatment-resistant schizophrenia, due to its role in immune function. Clozapine can cause severe impacts on immune function like agranulocytosis, and genetic variations in TRAT1 could affect how the immune system responds to such drug-induced effects through pharmacodynamic interactions, rather than affecting the drug's pharmacokinetics.
