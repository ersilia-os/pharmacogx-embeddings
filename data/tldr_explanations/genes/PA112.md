The CHRM3 gene, which encodes the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3, plays a key role in pharmacogenetic interactions related to antimuscarinic medications like tiotropium, used mainly for COPD, by affecting smooth muscle contraction and glandular secretions. Variants in the CHRM3 gene could alter patient responses to these drugs, indicating possibilities for personalized treatment approaches. Additionally, ondansetron, typically an antiemetic, may interact with CHRM3 through its role in neurotransmitter modulation, suggesting broader implications in neurotransmitter regulation in tissues expressing this receptor.
