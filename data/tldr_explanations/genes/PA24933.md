In the realm of pharmacogenetics, the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors such as cetuximab and panitumumab, used for treating colorectal and head and neck cancers, can be influenced by the expression levels of AREG, a ligand of EGFR. Elevated AREG expression might enhance these drugs' therapeutic effects by intensifying the inhibition of the EGFR pathway, potentially improving clinical outcomes for cancer therapies, including other drugs like irinotecan and capecitabine that indirectly interact with this pathway.
