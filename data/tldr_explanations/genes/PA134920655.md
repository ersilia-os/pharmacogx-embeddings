ADAMTSL2 is primarily involved in connective tissue organization but has no well-documented pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs, including buprenorphine, which is used for pain management and opioid addiction. Any potential connection between ADAMTSL2 and buprenorphine's effectiveness in managing pain involving the extracellular matrix is speculative and not established in current research.
