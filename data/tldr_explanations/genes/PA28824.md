The GP6 gene, which affects the pharmacodynamics of antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin, encodes for Glycoprotein VI, a receptor essential for platelet activation and aggregation. Variations in this gene can alter platelet response to aspirin, potentially impacting the effectiveness and safety of the therapy by modifying the balance between thrombosis and bleeding risks, thus highlighting the importance of adjusting medication based on these genetic differences to optimize treatment outcomes.
