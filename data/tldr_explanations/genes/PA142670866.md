The SSU72 gene, which plays a critical role in transcription regulation and mRNA splicing, might influence the efficacy of the chemotherapy drug capecitabineâ€”a prodrug metabolized into 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which disrupts RNA processing. The interaction between SSU72 and capecitabine could affect how 5-FU impacts transcriptional pathways regulated by SSU72, potentially affecting drug effectiveness through a non-pharmacokinetic mechanism involving transcriptional regulation rather than direct drug metabolism.
