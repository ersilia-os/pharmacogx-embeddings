Mutations in the SCN1A gene, which encodes the NaV1.1 sodium channel, influence the effectiveness and safety of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, oxcarbazepine, and lamotrigine, by modifying sodium channel function. These medications primarily inhibit sodium channels to reduce neuronal excitability, and alterations in SCN1A can affect both the metabolism and efficacy of these drugs, with even broader pharmacogenetic implications potentially extending to other drugs like fluorouracil.
