The FHIT gene, involved in tumor suppression and purine metabolism, impacts the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic drugs like cisplatin and etoposide. Reduced expression of FHIT is linked to decreased sensitivity to these DNA-damaging agents, likely due to its role in apoptotic pathways and DNA repair processes, affecting the drugs' cytotoxic effects on cancer cells.
