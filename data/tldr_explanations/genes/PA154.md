SLC29A1, acting as the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1), modulates the pharmacokinetics and cellular uptake of numerous drugs, especially nucleoside analogs used in antiviral and anticancer therapies such as gemcitabine, fludarabine, and cytarabine. Genetic variations or dysfunction in SLC29A1 can significantly alter drug efficacy and toxicity, influencing treatment outcomes in conditions like leukemia and necessitating personalized dosing strategies for drugs including mercaptopurine, azathioprine, ribavirin, methotrexate, trifluridine, and tipiracil hydrochloride.
