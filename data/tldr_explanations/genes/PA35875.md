Pharmacogenetic interactions with the gene SLC2A1, coding for GLUT1, are significant in treating GLUT1 deficiency syndrome by implementing ketogenic diets to substitute ketones for defective glucose transport. In oncology, research focuses on developing GLUT1 inhibitors to reduce heightened glucose uptake by cancer cells, reflecting GLUT1's potential influence on future drug designs targeting metabolic pathways in tumors.
