Cefotaxime's clearance is influenced by genetic variations in the SLC22A8 gene, which encodes the Organic Anion Transporter 3 (OAT3) responsible for its renal excretion. These variations can lead to altered drug levels in the body, thereby affecting the efficacy and safety of cefotaxime, particularly in patients with renal impairment.
