Various drugs interact with MMP9, a gene involved in tissue remodeling and disease processes, primarily through non-pharmacokinetic mechanisms. Nifedipine and hydralazine, both cardiovascular drugs, may indirectly affect MMP9 by influencing vascular integrity and dynamics, while simvastatin could interact by modulating inflammatory pathways and tissue responses. Ulinastatin, a protease inhibitor, may directly impact MMP9's enzymatic activity, influencing inflammation and metastasis processes. These drugs generally modify the biological pathways involving MMP9 rather than altering the drugâ€™s pharmacokinetics directly.
