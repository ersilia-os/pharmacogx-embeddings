BST1, involved in immune cell regulation and differentiation, may indirectly affect the pharmacodynamics of drugs that target immune functions or signaling pathways, especially those impacting calcium signaling. The gene's role in immune cell adhesion and calcium-dependent processes suggests it could influence the efficacy or toxicity of drugs used in treating conditions like T-cell leukemia, inflammatory disorders, and other immune-related diseases, although direct links between BST1 variants and pharmacologic effects are not well established.
