SH2D1A, involved in immune regulation, does not directly interact with specific drugs but influences treatment approaches for X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP) through immunomodulatory therapies. These treatments are tailored to mitigate uncontrolled immune responses in patients with SH2D1A mutations, focusing on the pharmacodynamic effects of the medications on the disease's pathology rather than on pharmacokinetic drug interactions.
