SLC25A31, involved in ADP and ATP transport across mitochondrial membranes, may influence the pharmacodynamics of cardiovascular drugs like hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol, and atenolol indirectly due to its role in cellular energy management. While there is no direct evidence of specific pharmacogenetic interactions between SLC25A31 and these drugs, any genetic variations in SLC25A31 could hypothetically affect drug effectiveness through broader impacts on cellular energy processes.
