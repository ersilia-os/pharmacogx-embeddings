The gene HNF1A influences how patients with Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young type 3 (MODY3) respond to sulfonylureas, drugs that enhance insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells, by maintaining beta-cell function despite genetic mutations. Additionally, HNF1A mutations affect the metabolism of rosuvastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug, due to its regulatory role in drug metabolism genes, which impacts the drug's effectiveness and safety.
