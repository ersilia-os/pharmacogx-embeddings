C11orf65, a gene with a ubiquitous and crucial cellular role, may potentially interact with a variety of drugs like metformin, warfarin, simvastatin, and tacrolimus, which each belong to different drug classes and have distinct mechanisms. These interactions, largely speculative without direct empirical evidence, could influence the pharmacokinetics of these medications through C11orf65's involvement in basic metabolic pathways, drug metabolism, distribution, and immune cell regulation.
