CYP3A5 plays a key role in the metabolism of several drugs, including immunosuppressants like tacrolimus and cyclosporine, where genetic variants impact dosing due to altered metabolism rates. This enzyme also affects the metabolism and effectiveness of other drugs such as itraconazole, statins (simvastatin and atorvastatin), apixaban, vincristine, ondansetron, atazanavir, and fentanyl, which in turn influences their therapeutic outcomes and risk profiles.
