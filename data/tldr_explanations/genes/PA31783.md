NRP1, a gene involved in the VEGF signaling pathway, influences the effectiveness of cancer therapies like Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets VEGF to inhibit tumor angiogenesis. Variations in NRP1 may affect how well drugs such as Bevacizumab work, due to differences in VEGF signaling and potential impacts on immune checkpoint pathways, thereby altering the drug's therapeutic outcomes.
