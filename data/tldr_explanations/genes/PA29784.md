Mycophenolate mofetil, an immunosuppressive drug, potentially interacts indirectly with the gene IL12A, which is instrumental in forming the IL-12 cytokine involved in T-cell differentiation and activity. Although mycophenolate mofetil primarily inhibits purine synthesis affecting T and B cells, its overall suppression of immune responses could modulate the IL-12 mediated Th1 responses, highlighting the indirect connection with IL12A's function in immune pathway modulation.
