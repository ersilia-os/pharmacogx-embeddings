Research indicates that TIRAP, a gene involved in immune response modulation, has genetic variations like the Ser180Leu SNP which can influence disease susceptibility and treatment responses in inflammatory conditions such as sepsis and tuberculosis. Although specific drug interactions with TIRAP are not fully established, the gene's role in pharmacogenetics could be crucial for understanding personalized treatment strategies and risk assessments, presenting opportunities for future drug development targeting TIRAP-mediated pathways.
