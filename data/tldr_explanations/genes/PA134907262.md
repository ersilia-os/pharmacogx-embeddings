KIAA2026 is a gene that does not directly interact with drug metabolism, but it is speculated to possibly influence cellular responses or resistance mechanisms to chemotherapy drugs like cytarabine and idarubicin, potentially affecting drug efficacy or toxicity indirectly through cellular signaling or gene expression alterations. This interaction is not related to pharmacokinetics but could involve non-pharmacokinetic pathways.
