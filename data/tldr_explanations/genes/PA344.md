SULT1A3 is essential for the metabolism and detoxification of drugs like tapentadol, acetaminophen, tramadol, o-desmethyltramadol, and morphine, where it influences their bioavailability, efficacy, and toxicity by affecting their presystemic metabolism in the liver and gastrointestinal tract. Variations in the SULT1A3 gene can significantly alter the plasma levels and pharmacokinetic profiles of these drugs, thereby impacting their therapeutic effectiveness and risk of adverse effects.
