The pharmacogenetics of the gene IFNG (Interferon Gamma) primarily concerns its role in mediating immune responses, affecting how therapies like interferon gamma-1b (Actimmune) work differently among individuals due to genetic variations. These genetic differences impact the treatmentâ€™s efficacy in enhancing immune functions and managing side effects, which are crucial in immunological conditions like chronic granulomatous disease and severe malignant osteopetrosis.
