The gene MED12L may influence the effectiveness of the antiplatelet drugs clopidogrel, ticagrelor, and aspirin through its role in transcriptional regulation mechanisms that affect pathways related to platelet activation and aggregation. Despite the theoretical nature of these interactions, potential genetic variations in MED12L could modulate how these drugs prevent blood clots.
