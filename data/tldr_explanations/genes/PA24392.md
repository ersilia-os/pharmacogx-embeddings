ABCC10, known as Multidrug Resistance Protein 7 (MRP7), plays a significant role in drug efflux, affecting the pharmacokinetics and potentially the pharmacodynamics of various drugs. This gene modulates the absorption and elimination of drugs like nevirapine and impacts drug resistance in chemotherapeutic agents such as docetaxel and oxaliplatin by enhancing their extrusion and reducing their intracellular accumulation. It also influences the disposition of antiviral agents like tenofovir, ultimately affecting their therapeutic efficacy and contributing to personalized medicine strategies by optimizing treatment based on individual genetic profiles.
