CD96 is considered a potential pharmacogenetic target due to its role in T-cell activation and tumor immune responses, but there are no well-documented interactions between CD96 and the chemotherapeutic agent capecitabine. Variations in the CD96 gene could potentially influence the immune system's response to tumors during treatment with agents like capecitabine, although these interactions are speculative and require further investigation.
