XRCC3, a gene involved in DNA repair, plays a significant role in the body's reaction to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents like cisplatin and carboplatin. Variants in XRCC3, such as Thr241Met, can impact the effectiveness and toxicity of treatments with these drugs, as well as with others like docetaxel, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, leucovorin, and fluorouracil, by altering the DNA repair capability of cancer cells, thus influencing both therapeutic outcomes and the side effect profiles.
