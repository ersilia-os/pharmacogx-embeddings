Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, which are direct agonists of PPARG, play a critical role in enhancing insulin sensitivity in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The efficacy and safety of TZDs can be influenced by genetic polymorphisms in PPARG, like the Pro12Ala variant, affecting individual responses and side effects like weight gain and edema; other drugs like metformin and aspirin interact with PPARG pathways mainly through pharmacodynamic effects.
