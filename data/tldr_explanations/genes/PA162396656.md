N6AMT1, a gene involved in DNA methylation and repair, significantly impacts the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel, an antiplatelet drug, by influencing its hepatic biotransformation into an active metabolite. Variants in N6AMT1 can alter clopidogrel's effectiveness and the risk of adverse effects, affecting drug activation and efficacy in thrombosis prevention.
