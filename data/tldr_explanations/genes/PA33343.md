Allopurinol, a drug used to reduce uric acid levels in treating gout, interacts pharmacogenetically with the PKD2 gene, which is crucial for calcium channel functioning and plays a role in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). While the exact mechanism of this interaction isn't well-documented, it is theorized that allopurinol might help preserve renal function in ADPKD patients by reducing urate-induced renal stress and possibly preventing further renal damage and cyst growth, despite not traditionally being linked to calcium signaling or cyst formation directly.
