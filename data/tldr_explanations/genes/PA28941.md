Specific genetic variants in the GRK4 gene, such as those in its Î³ isoform, affect the efficacy of antihypertensive medications like beta-blockers atenolol and metoprolol by modulating GPCR signaling pathways, impacting heart rate and blood pressure control. Additionally, these variations in GRK4 could influence the response to other cardiovascular drugs like verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, thus making GRK4 a critical pharmacogenetic factor in personalizing hypertension treatment based on genetic makeup.
