Pasireotide, a somatostatin analog used to treat hormone-related disorders like Cushing's disease and acromegaly, interacts with the SSTR5 gene, influencing cell signaling pathways affecting hormone secretion and tumor growth. Variants in the SSTR5 gene can modify the drugâ€™s binding efficiency and response, impacting its efficacy and side effect profile, thus underscoring the importance of considering genetic variability in SSTR5 when using pasireotide for optimal therapeutic results and reduced adverse effects.
