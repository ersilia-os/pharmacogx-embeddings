Drugs that impact the TLR4 pathway, such as corticosteroids and biologics, might have varying effects depending on individual LY96 genotypes, which affect the inflammatory response intensity. Genetic variants in LY96 could alter how these drugs modulate the immune system, impacting their efficacy and safety in treating conditions like sepsis, inflammatory bowel disease, and asthma.
