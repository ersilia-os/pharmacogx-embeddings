CYP1B1 plays a crucial role in the metabolism of a variety of drugs, notably affecting the efficacy and toxicity of oncological treatments such as cyclophosphamide, docetaxel, doxorubicin, epirubicin, paclitaxel, and fluorouracil, and influencing the activation and effectiveness of pain management drugs like codeine and tramadol. Genetic polymorphisms in CYP1B1 can lead to altered enzyme activity, potentially necessitating dosage adjustments to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize side effects.
