In the treatment of cancers such as medullary thyroid cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, the RET gene mutations affect the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors like vandetanib, cabozantinib, selpercatinib, and pralsetinib. These drugs work by inhibiting the RET kinase activity, which blocks downstream signaling pathways essential for cancer cell growth and survival, thereby demonstrating crucial pharmacodynamic interactions with the RET gene.
