Methotrexate, by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase, and tegafur, as a prodrug converted to 5-fluorouracil which inhibits thymidylate synthase, both affect folate metabolism, with their impacts potentially moderated or exacerbated based on MTRR gene variants. Supplements like folic acid and leucovorin may counteract these effects by compensating for the inhibition of folate-related enzymes, particularly under the influence of MTRR gene variations.
