The effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapies (ERTs) like agalsidase beta and agalsidase alfa, used to treat Fabry disease by supplementing the deficient enzyme, can be influenced by mutations in the GLA gene, affecting the drug's pharmacokinetics. Additionally, migalastat, an oral drug, interacts pharmacodynamically with certain mutant forms of the GLA enzyme by stabilizing and improving enzyme routing, but its effectiveness is dependent on specific mutations within the GLA gene, necessitating genetic screening for optimal treatment selection.
