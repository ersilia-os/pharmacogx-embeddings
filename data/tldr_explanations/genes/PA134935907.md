ZNF432, part of the zinc finger protein family, does not have clearly established pharmacogenetic interactions with specific drugs but is speculated to potentially influence the transcriptional responses to respiratory medications like salbutamol, budesonide, beclomethasone, and fluticasone propionate. Although these drugs work through anti-inflammatory and bronchodilatory effects, the role of ZNF432 could theoretically affect how cells manage inflammation and airway cell repair and apoptosis, though direct evidence of such interactions remains undocumented.
