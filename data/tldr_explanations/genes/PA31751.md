Drugs such as T0901317 and GW3965 serve as LXR agonists directly targeting NR1H3 (LXR-alpha), enhancing the transcription of genes involved in regulating lipid and glucose metabolism, beneficial in treating metabolic disorders like atherosclerosis, obesity, and diabetes, yet potentially causing hypertriglyceridemia. Indirectly, cardiovascular drugs verapamil and atenolol might also affect NR1H3 activity or expression, impacting metabolic pathways associated with cholesterol and glucose regulation, important in cardiovascular health.
