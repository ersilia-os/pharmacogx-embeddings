GDNF, known for its neuroprotective attributes in Parkinsonâ€™s disease, has limited direct pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs but shows promise in mitigating chemotherapy side effects via potential indirect interactions. Notably, the antidepressant paroxetine has been studied for its ability to possibly upregulate GDNF expression, aiding in neuronal survival and potentially reducing chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity, indicating a therapeutic link rather than a direct pharmacogenetic interaction.
