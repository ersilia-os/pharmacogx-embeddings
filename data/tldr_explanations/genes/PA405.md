CYP4F8 plays a role in the metabolism of fatty acids and leukotriene B4, suggesting that variations in this gene could influence the metabolism and efficacy of dermatological and anti-inflammatory drugs, particularly those like montelukast or zileuton that target leukotriene pathways. The interaction of CYP4F8 with these drugs primarily affects their pharmacokinetics, potentially altering drug effectiveness and safety.
