The PAPLN gene, involved in the formation and maintenance of the extracellular matrix (ECM), does not directly interact with therapeutic drugs but may have pharmacogenetic implications especially with drugs like citalopram that impact tissue structures. Citalopram, an antidepressant, potentially affects the ECM in the cardiovascular system where PAPLN is expressed, suggesting a more pharmacodynamic interaction that could influence drug distribution and the biomechanical properties of tissues, thereby affecting drug efficacy or toxicity.
