CBR1 notably affects the metabolism of chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin and daunorubicin by reducing them into less active compounds like doxorubicinol, thereby potentially altering their effectiveness and toxicity, particularly influencing cardiotoxicity risks. Genetic variants in CBR1 can lead to varied metabolism rates, impacting drug plasma levels and toxicity, while its interactions with other drugs like fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide, though less definitively understood, suggest modifications in drug efficacy and safety through carbonyl reduction.
