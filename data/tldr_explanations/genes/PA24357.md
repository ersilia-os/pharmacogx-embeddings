The gene A2M, Alpha-2-Macroglobulin, is involved in pharmacodynamics by affecting inflammation and conditions like Alzheimer's, COPD, and arthritis through its ability to bind and modulate the clearance of molecules such as amyloid-beta peptides. Although direct interactions of specific drugs with A2M are not well-defined, variability in A2M could potentially influence the efficacy of drugs that target amyloid-beta or modify its metabolism, indicating a role in guiding treatment strategies in diseases linked to protease dysregulation.
