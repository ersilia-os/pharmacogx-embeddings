The gene SHMT1, which plays a crucial role in folate metabolism, interacts pharmacogenetically with several anticancer drugs like methotrexate, fluorouracil, capecitabine, leucovorin, and irinotecan. Variations in SHMT1 can influence the efficacy and safety of these drugs, as it affects the folate pathways integral to the mechanism of action (e.g., methotrexate's inhibition of folate production, fluorouracil's incorporation into DNA/RNA synthesis), possibly impacting therapeutic outcomes and necessitating consideration of genetic differences in treatment planning.
