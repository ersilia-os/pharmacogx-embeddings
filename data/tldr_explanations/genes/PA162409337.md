Atenolol, a beta-blocker used for cardiovascular conditions, might interact with the gene XIRP2, which is involved in maintaining muscle structural integrity, through pharmacodynamic mechanisms that involve cardiac muscle activity and cardiovascular function. This potential interaction is not pharmacokinetic since atenolol is primarily eliminated by the kidneys without significant metabolism affecting muscle structure.
