SETD4, involved in histone methylation and chromatin structure, potentially influences the action of the oncology drug doxorubicin by modifying how DNA is exposed or organized for drug interaction, affecting the drugâ€™s effectiveness or toxicity. This interaction, focusing on pharmacodynamics rather than pharmacokinetics, suggests that variations in SETD4 could lead to differing patient responses to doxorubicin, stemming from changes in the chromatin state dictated by SETD4.
