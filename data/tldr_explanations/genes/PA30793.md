MGST3, involved in detoxifying substrates via glutathione conjugation, indirectly affects the pharmacokinetics of drugs like acetaminophen, which relies on glutathione for safe metabolism in the liver. Variations in MGST3 could alter glutathione levels, affecting the toxicity and effectiveness of acetaminophen and potentially other drugs that undergo similar metabolic processes.
