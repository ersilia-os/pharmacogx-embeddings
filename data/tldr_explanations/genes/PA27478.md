The DRD2 gene, encoding the D2 dopamine receptor, significantly influences the pharmacogenetics of various drugs, mainly used in treating psychiatric and neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Drugs like olanzapine, chlorpromazine, and aripiprazole interact pharmacodynamically by modulating receptor activity, leading to varied therapeutic outcomes and side effects, while others like levodopa and rasagiline affect dopamine signaling pathways, impacting disease symptoms and drug metabolism.
