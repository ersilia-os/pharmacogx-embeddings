CYP4X1, through its role in the hydroxylation of fatty acids, may indirectly influence the pharmacokinetics of lipid-soluble drugs like fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide, potentially affecting their distribution or clearance due to changes in lipid metabolism pathways. Although direct interactions of CYP4X1 with these drugs are not established, its enzymatic activity in fatty acid metabolism suggests possible effects on how these drugs are processed within the body's lipid environments.
