GSTM3, an enzyme involved in drug metabolism and detoxification, plays a key role in the body's handling of olanzapine and cyclophosphamide by conjugating toxins with glutathione, which affects these drugs' solubility and excretion. For olanzapine, GSTM3 may alter the drug's clearance and efficacy, while for cyclophosphamide, it is crucial in detoxifying metabolites that contribute to the drugâ€™s cytotoxic effects, thus impacting the drug's effectiveness or toxicity.
