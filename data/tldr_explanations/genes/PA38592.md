The PNPLA3 gene, involved in lipid metabolism, indirectly affects the pharmacodynamics of various treatments for conditions like NAFLD and NASH, particularly impacting drugs used in oncology and immunosuppression such as tacrolimus, doxorubicin, and prednisolone. While direct pharmacokinetic interactions are not fully established, variations in PNPLA3 could influence the metabolic processing, cellular stress responses, or inflammation pathways of these drugs, thereby altering treatment outcomes in patients with disrupted lipid metabolism and liver function.
