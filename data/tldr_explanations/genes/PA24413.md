Imatinib, Dasatinib, Nilotinib, Ponatinib, and Bosutinib are tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target the BCR-ABL fusion protein, which arises from a translocation involving the ABL1 gene typical in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Drug effectiveness varies due to mutations in the ABL1 kinase domain, such as the T315I mutation that causes resistance to several TKIs except for Ponatinib, and Asciminib provides a distinct therapeutic option by inhibiting ABL1 allosterically, which can overcome resistance seen with ATP-competitive inhibitors like Imatinib.
