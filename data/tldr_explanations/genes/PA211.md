Drugs such as amiodarone, quinidine, and sotalol interact with the KCNE1 gene, which encodes a component of potassium channels involved in cardiac repolarization. These interactions significantly affect the QT interval on an electrocardiogram, particularly in patients with specific genetic variants of KCNE1, influencing the risk of developing severe arrhythmias like torsades de pointes.
