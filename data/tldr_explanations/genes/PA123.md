CYP2B6 plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of several drugs, including efavirenz, nevirapine, methadone, bupropion, cyclophosphamide, and ifosfamide, where genetic polymorphisms can significantly influence drug efficacy and safety by altering pharmacokinetic profiles. Genetic variations in CYP2B6 affect the enzyme activity, leading to differences in drug plasma concentrations, therapeutic effects, and potential adverse reactions in individuals, underscoring its importance in personalized medicine.
