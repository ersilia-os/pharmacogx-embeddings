As of now, there are no specific drugs identified that have documented pharmacogenetic interactions with the SUGCT gene, which is involved in the degradation of L-tryptophan into acetyl-CoA. While the role of SUGCT in metabolism suggests potential implications for the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized via acetyl-CoA pathways, conclusive evidence of such interactions is currently lacking in scientific literature.
