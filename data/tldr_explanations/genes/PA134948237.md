GSTK1 influences the metabolism and detoxification of drugs that undergo glutathione conjugation, such as acetaminophen and various chemotherapeutic agents, through its role in glutathione pathways. Variations in the GSTK1 gene due to genetic polymorphisms can affect the efficacy and toxicity of these drugs, potentially altering their therapeutic outcomes and safety, such as modifying the risk of acetaminophen-induced liver toxicity and impacting the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapeutics in cancer treatment.
