Variations in the DHRS2 gene, which plays a crucial role in converting retinaldehyde to retinol, could affect the metabolism of retinoid drugs like isotretinoin, used for treating severe acne. This genetic variability might alter retinoid levels in the body, potentially impacting the efficacy or toxicity of isotretinoin and thus influencing patient-specific drug responses and treatment outcomes.
