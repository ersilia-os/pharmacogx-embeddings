Drugs that affect mitochondrial function or iron metabolism could potentially exhibit altered dynamics when interacting with genetic variations in the ABCB8 gene. Although no specific drugs have been conclusively linked to ABCB8, variations in this gene could influence the effects of medications used for conditions related to mitochondrial dysfunction and iron homeostasis, such as mitochondrial toxicity or iron chelation therapies.
