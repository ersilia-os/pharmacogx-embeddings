SLC13A3, involved in transporting key substances for the Krebs cycle, plays a critical role in the renal excretion and metabolic processing of drugs. Although not directly associated with specific drugs, variations in SLC13A3 may alter the handling of citrate and impact the efficacy and toxicity of medications that depend on renal clearance mechanisms, potentially affecting treatments like kidney stone prevention or metabolic acidosis where drugs like Potassium citrate or Sodium bicarbonate are used.
