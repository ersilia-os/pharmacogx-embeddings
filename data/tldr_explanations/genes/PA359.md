The drugs 5-fluorouracil (fluorouracil), capecitabine, and pemetrexed target the TYMS gene, which encodes thymidylate synthetase crucial for DNA synthesis, thus inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. Variations in the TYMS gene affect the efficacy and toxicity of these treatments, with increased TYMS expression leading to drug resistance and reduced expression enhancing sensitivity, impacting the need for dosage adjustments based on individual genetic profiles. Methotrexate also interacts indirectly by affecting the folate pathway, impacting TYMS activity.
