The RPTOR gene regulates the activity of the mTORC1 complex and influences how cancer treatment drugs like rapamycin (sirolimus), everolimus, and other rapalogs function. These drugs inhibit the mTOR pathway to decrease protein synthesis and tumor cell proliferation, particularly in cancers like hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, with the pharmacogenetic interaction mainly affecting pharmacodynamics by influencing the drug's effect on the target pathway.
