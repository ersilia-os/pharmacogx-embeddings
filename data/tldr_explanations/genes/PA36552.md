Drugs such as tacrolimus, acetaminophen, folic acid, pravastatin, and methotrexate interact with the TLR4 gene, which plays a role in the modulation of immune and inflammatory responses. Tacrolimus interacts with TLR4 affecting its pharmacokinetics possibly by altering absorption or metabolism, while acetaminophen, folic acid, pravastatin, and methotrexate could influence TLR4 pathways affecting their pharmacodynamic profiles, notably in processes related to inflammation and immune system modulation.
