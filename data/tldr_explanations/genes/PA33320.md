The pharmacogenetic profile of the PIN1 gene, which encodes an enzyme that regulates protein function post-phosphorylation, affects interactions with drugs such as oxaliplatin and irinotecan used in cancer treatment. PIN1's enzymatic action on cell cycle progression and apoptosis might modulate the efficacy of these drugs since it stabilizes and controls the function of key oncogenes and oncoproteins, although the exact mechanism of these interactions is not fully detailed through pharmacokinetics or dynamics.
