HCP5 plays a crucial role in pharmacogenetics, specifically interacting with abacavir, a drug used in HIV treatment. The hypersensitivity to abacavir is linked to the HCP5-related rs2395029 polymorphism, which affects the expression of the HLA-B*5701 allele, necessitating genetic testing before prescribing the drug to avoid severe adverse reactions. While there are potential interactions with other immune-modulating drugs, such as flucloxacillin and gemcitabine, these are not as clearly defined as the interaction with abacavir.
