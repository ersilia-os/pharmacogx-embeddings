Variation in the TCL1A gene may affect the efficacy of the cancer drug exemestane, used for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, likely due to TCL1A's role in signaling pathways like PI3K/AKT that are crucial for cancer cell survival and proliferation. Despite the potential significance of this pharmacogenetic interaction, the exact mechanism by which TCL1A influences exemestaneâ€™s effectiveness remains unclear.
