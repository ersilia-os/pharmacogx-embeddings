Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the IL6R gene, is used in treating rheumatoid arthritis, with its efficacy and safety being influenced by genetic variations in IL6R such as the rs2228145 polymorphism. These variations alter how patients respond to the drug, affecting therapeutic outcomes and the risk of adverse effects through pharmacodynamic interactions.
