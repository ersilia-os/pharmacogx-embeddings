SLC2A5, a gene encoding the GLUT5 fructose transporter, indirectly influences the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs related to carbohydrate metabolism. While specific interactions with named drugs are not well-documented, variations in SLC2A5 could affect the efficacy of drugs that alter insulin sensitivity, carbohydrate absorption, or are involved in treating conditions like diabetes, potentially including medications like metformin or insulin.
