Variations in the TPH1 gene, which is crucial for serotonin biosynthesis, can affect the efficacy and metabolic responses to serotonin-modulating drugs such as citalopram and escitalopram, SSRIs that may work differently depending on TPH1 expression. Additionally, drugs like pimozide and ondansetron, which target serotonin receptors directly, can also have altered effectiveness based on TPH1 genetic differences, impacting therapeutic outcomes in conditions such as depression and irritable bowel syndrome.
