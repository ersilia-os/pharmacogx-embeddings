The effectiveness of Eculizumab, a drug used for treating atypical Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (aHUS), can be influenced by variants in the C3 gene, which encodes an element essential in the complement cascade, affecting the drug's interaction with the immune system. While drugs like clozapine, known for immunomodulatory effects, do not directly interact pharmacokinetically with C3, their impact on the immune system could potentially influence or be influenced by the activities of the complement system.
