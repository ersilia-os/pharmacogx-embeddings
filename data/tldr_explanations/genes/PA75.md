CCND1, a gene involved in cell cycle regulation, influences the pharmacodynamics of various chemotherapeutic agents including CDK4/6 inhibitors like palbociclib and traditional chemotherapy drugs such as fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and methotrexate. Genetic alterations in CCND1 can affect drug efficacy; for instance, CCND1 amplification may lead to resistance by promoting continual cell cycle progression and preventing effective drug-induced cell cycle arrest, undermining the therapeutic actions of these drugs.
