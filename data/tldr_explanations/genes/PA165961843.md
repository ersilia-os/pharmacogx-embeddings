HCAR2, a gene that regulates lipid metabolism, interacts with niacin, a drug used to manage dyslipidemia, triggering a signaling cascade that inhibits lipolysis and reduces free fatty acids in the bloodstream. Genetic variations in HCAR2 can affect the drug's effectiveness and the incidence of side effects like niacin-induced flushing, making the pharmacodynamic interaction between niacin and HCAR2 essential for understanding individual responses to therapy.
