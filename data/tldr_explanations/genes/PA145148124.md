Polymorphisms in the gene SH2B3, which is involved in cytokine receptor signaling, can influence the effectiveness and side effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors used in treating leukemia by affecting how these drugs block kinase enzymes critical for cancer cell growth. Additionally, variations in SH2B3 may indirectly interact with drugs like candesartan, potentially through modulation of immune or inflammatory pathways, rather than directly affecting pharmacokinetics.
