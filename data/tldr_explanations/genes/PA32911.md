The drug sapropterin dihydrochloride, a synthetic form of the cofactor BH4, enhances the activity of the PAH gene in metabolizing phenylalanine to tyrosine, especially helpful in treating phenylketonuria (PKU) for individuals with specific gene mutations. Other drugs such as l-phenylalanine and carbocisteine interact with PAH due to their roles in amino acid pathways, and atenolol's interaction may involve pharmacodynamic effects related to amino acid neurotransmitter pathways, suggesting personalized genetic testing to optimize treatment efficacy.
