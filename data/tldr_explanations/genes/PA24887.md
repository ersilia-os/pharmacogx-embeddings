APOA4 gene variations influence the pharmacogenetic interactions with fenofibrate, a lipid-lowering medication, by affecting its efficacy through pharmacodynamic mechanisms governed by APOA4's role in lipid metabolism. The efficacy of fenofibrate in reducing triglycerides and altering HDL cholesterol levels can vary depending on the genetic variants of the APOA4 gene, guiding more personalized and effective treatment approaches for cardiovascular health.
