The MAN1A1 gene, important for removing mannose residues from N-linked glycoproteins, does not directly interact with the chemotherapeutic prodrug capecitabine, which is primarily metabolized by other enzymes. However, changes in glycoprotein processing influenced by MAN1A1 could theoretically affect the efficacy or metabolism of drugs like capecitabine by impacting cellular mechanisms such as drug transport or uptake, especially relevant in cancer treatment contexts where glycoproteins affect drug resistance or targeted delivery.
