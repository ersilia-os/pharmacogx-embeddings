The CBS gene influences the metabolism of methionine and is crucial in conditions like homocystinuria, where elevated homocysteine levels are managed through the administration of high doses of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine). Vitamin B6 acts as a cofactor for the CBS enzyme, enhancing the conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine and thus reducing the complications associated with homocysteine accumulation such as thrombosis and vascular damage.
