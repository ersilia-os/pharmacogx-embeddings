HSD11B1, which converts inactive cortisone to active cortisol, does not directly metabolize tacrolimus or dexamethasone; however, its role in controlling cortisol levels can affect the pharmacodynamics of dexamethasone by altering glucocorticoid receptor activity. This indirect interaction can influence the efficacy and side effects of dexamethasone, underscoring the significance of HSD11B1 in modulating the effects of glucocorticoid therapies through its regulation of cortisol availability.
