Variants of the IFNL3 gene, such as rs12979860, significantly affect the treatment outcomes of hepatitis C, particularly with respect to pegylated interferon and ribavirin, where the CC genotype leads to better responses. Additionally, IFNL3 genetic variations influence the effectiveness of direct-acting antivirals like simeprevir and sofosbuvir, among others, by modulating the immune system's response to these medications, potentially impacting a broader range of antiviral treatments including those for HIV and HBV.
