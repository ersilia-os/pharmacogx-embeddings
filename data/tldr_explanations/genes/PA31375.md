MYH7B, a gene involved in cardiac and skeletal muscle function, does not directly interact with the drug capecitabine, a prodrug converted to 5-fluorouracil. However, given capecitabine's potential cardiotoxic side effects, such as angina or myocardial infarction, there may be an indirect role for MYH7B in how genetic variations in this gene could influence the cardiac response to drug-induced stress.
