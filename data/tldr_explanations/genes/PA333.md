The SLC22A5 gene, encoding the OCTN2 protein involved in carnitine transport, plays a significant role in drug pharmacokinetics by influencing cellular metabolism and energy production. Although there's no direct evidence of a pharmacokinetic interaction of the SLC22A5 gene with the drugs imatinib and sunitinib, its role in carnitine uptake could indirectly affect these drugs' pharmacodynamics, particularly in high fatty acid metabolic tissues such as the heart and muscles, potentially altering therapy outcomes.
