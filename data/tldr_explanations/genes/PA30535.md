MAFB has not been explicitly linked with direct pharmacogenetic interactions with specific drugs; however, due to its role in the differentiation and development of cells relevant to diabetes and autoimmune conditions, it may impact the pharmacodynamics of drugs like insulin modulators or immune system modifiers. Current associations between MAFB and drug responses are hypothetical and not yet confirmed through specific research.
