METTL1, a gene involved in tRNA methylation and protein synthesis, is considered a potential target for cancer therapeutics that manipulate these processes. Although no specific drugs currently target METTL1 directly, its role suggests that it may influence the pharmacodynamics of drugs impacting methionine and folate metabolism pathways, which are involved in cellular methylation processes.
