Variants in the INSIG2 gene, which regulates cholesterol synthesis via the SREBPs pathway, could potentially affect the efficacy or required dosing of statins, drugs that inhibit cholesterol synthesis by targeting HMG-CoA reductase. Although the direct pharmacogenetic interactions between INSIG2 and clozapine, a drug affecting lipid metabolism and primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, are not clearly established, there could be theoretical interactions affecting clozapine's metabolic effects on lipid profiles.
