In patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the presence of NPM1 mutations can alter the efficacy of drugs like venetoclax and midostaurin. Venetoclax, which inhibits BCL-2, may be more effective in patients with these mutations due to changes in apoptotic pathways, while the effectiveness of midostaurin, a kinase inhibitor targeting FLT3 and other tyrosine kinases, can also be influenced by NPM1 mutations affecting signaling pathways and apoptosis regulation. These interactions highlight the role of NPM1 mutation status in tailoring AML treatment.
