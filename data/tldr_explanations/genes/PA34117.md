Although there are no documented direct pharmacogenetic interactions between RAB27A and specific drugs, RAB27A's role in vesicle trafficking may indirectly impact the therapeutic outcomes of drugs used in immunotherapies or treatments affecting melanocyte function. This impact is likely due to the gene's influence on immune cell activity and pigmentation processes, necessitating careful consideration of RAB27A's activity in drugs targeting vesicle trafficking-related pathways in these cells.
