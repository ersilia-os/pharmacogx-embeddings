SULT1C3, a gene encoding a sulfotransferase enzyme, plays a role in the pharmacokinetics of candesartan, a hypertension medication, by potentially influencing its metabolism and excretion through sulfate conjugation. This interaction may affect the drugâ€™s efficacy and side effect profile by altering how candesartan is metabolized and cleared from the body.
