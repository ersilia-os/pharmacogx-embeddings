HSPG2, which encodes the protein perlecan, plays a role in vascular development and angiogenesis, potentially affecting the pharmacodynamics of drugs used in cancer therapy and cardiovascular diseases, particularly those targeting angiogenesis and growth factor pathways. Although direct pharmacogenetic interactions with specific drugs are not well-established, variations in HSPG2 might influence drug efficacy or safety by altering growth factor receptor interactions or signaling mechanisms.
