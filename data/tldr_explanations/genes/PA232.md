Fenofibrate directly enhances the expression of the LPL gene, improving lipid profiles by increasing the breakdown of triglycerides in lipoproteins like VLDL and chylomicrons; whereas drugs such as pravastatin and pioglitazone may interact indirectly with LPL activity, potentially affecting broader lipid metabolism pathways and influencing therapeutic outcomes in lipid metabolism disorders. These interactions involve both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms, altering how these drugs are processed and act in the body.
