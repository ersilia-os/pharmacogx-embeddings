Although there is no direct evidence in medical literature linking the gene FASTKD3, which influences apoptosis and mitochondrial RNA processing, with pharmacogenetic interactions, its role in mitochondrial energy metabolism suggests it could impact the effectiveness or toxicity of drugs like tegafur, leucovorin, and methotrexate. These drugs, used in chemotherapy and associated with mitochondrial function, may have their efficacy or safety profiles affected if FASTKD3 alters mitochondrial integrity and function, making these potential interactions hypothetical and deserving of further study.
