The tumor suppressor gene WWOX is involved in regulating apoptosis and may impact the efficacy of cancer drugs like sorafenib, a kinase inhibitor, and gemcitabine, a nucleoside analog, through its role in cellular stress responses and apoptotic pathways. Although the interactions remain theoretical, changes in WWOX function or expression could alter cancer cell sensitivity to these drugs, potentially affecting their therapeutic effectiveness.
