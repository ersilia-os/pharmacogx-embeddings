Allopurinol, used primarily for gout and hyperuricemia, might interact with NTNG1, a gene involved in neurodevelopment and conditions such as schizophrenia, autism, and intellectual disabilities. While allopurinol typically inhibits xanthine oxidase affecting purine metabolism, its potential interaction with NTNG1 might involve modulation of neuroinflammatory pathways or neuroprotective effects, though evidence for this is not robust and the specific mechanisms remain unclear.
