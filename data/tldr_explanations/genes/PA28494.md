Venlafaxine, an antidepressant that primarily acts by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, may also indirectly modulate GABAergic neurotransmission, potentially interacting with GABA_A receptors, including those containing the GABRA6 subunit. This interaction, mainly pharmacodynamic, could alter receptor activity, impacting therapeutic effects or side effects by influencing inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain.
