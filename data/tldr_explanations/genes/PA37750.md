Variations in the IKZF3 gene, which influences lymphocyte differentiation, can affect the response to treatments such as cyclophosphamide in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. This is likely due to pharmacodynamic mechanisms where IKZF3 alters the signaling pathways targeted by immunomodulatory drugs, thus potentially impacting their efficacy and safety.
