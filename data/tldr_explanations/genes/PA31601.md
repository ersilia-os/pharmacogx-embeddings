Variations in the NFKBIA gene, which regulates inflammation and immune response via the NF-kappa-B pathway, can alter the pharmacodynamics of drugs such as gefitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in cancer treatment, by affecting cell survival pathways. Additionally, these gene variations may influence the efficacy of drugs like sufentanil, an opioid used for pain management, through their interaction with the NF-kappa-B pathway involved in inflammation and immune modulation.
