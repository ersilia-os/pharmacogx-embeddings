The ECT2L gene, functioning similarly to ECT2 and regulating cytokinesis and cytoskeleton, may potentially influence the pharmacodynamics of anticancer drugs, particularly those affecting the Rho/Rac GTPase pathways involved in cell division. Although direct interactions of ECT2L with specific drugs remain unidentified and speculative, its role in cell cycle processes suggests it could impact the efficacy and safety of drugs targeting these pathways in cancer treatment.
