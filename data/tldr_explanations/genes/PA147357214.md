The gene TMEM165, which plays a role in ionic homeostasis and glycosylation within the Golgi apparatus, might interact with the drug fluvoxamine, an SSRI not typically associated with these cellular functions. This interaction, potentially influencing glycosylation patterns indirectly, suggests a non-pharmacokinetic, possibly off-target effect of fluvoxamine on TMEM165-related pathways, which could be relevant for treating symptoms of glycosylation disorders such as TMEM165-CDG.
