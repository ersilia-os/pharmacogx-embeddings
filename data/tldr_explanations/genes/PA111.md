The CHRM2 gene, which encodes M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, influences the pharmacodynamic responses to drugs like propofol and nicotine, rather than affecting their pharmacokinetics. Propofol's sedative and cardiovascular effects and nicotine's cognitive and addictive responses might be modified by CHRM2 variants due to their roles in neurotransmission and cardiovascular regulation.
