Polymorphisms in the ADRB3 gene, such as the Trp64Arg variant, affect the pharmacodynamics of Î²-3 adrenergic receptor agonists which are used for conditions like obesity and overactive bladder by influencing thermogenesis and lipolysis. Additionally, drugs like carvedilol, a beta-blocker, and olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, interact with ADRB3 which might impact their effects on vascular resistance, metabolic parameters, and potentially exacerbate olanzapine-induced weight gain due to ADRB3's role in adipose metabolism and energy homeostasis.
