Carboplatin and paclitaxel, chemotherapeutic drugs used in treating cancers like colorectal, lung, and glioblastoma, may be impacted by mutations or irregularities in the MAD1L1 gene, which plays a vital role in the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint. These drugs either form DNA adducts or stabilize microtubules to inhibit mitosis, processes that are overseen by checkpoints involving MAD1L1, suggesting that abnormalities in MAD1L1 could affect the drugs' effectiveness or resistance profiles in cancer therapy.
