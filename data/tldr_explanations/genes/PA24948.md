Drugs that affect nitric oxide levels or its signaling pathways, such as nitric oxide donors used in cardiovascular diseases, may have altered effects when interacting with the ARG2 gene, which influences nitric oxide synthesis and the urea cycle. Variations in ARG2 could change the effectiveness or metabolism of these drugs, potentially impacting cardiovascular health outcomes.
