Variations in the ATP5MD gene, which is involved in cellular energy metabolism through mitochondrial ATP synthesis, could potentially affect the pharmacodynamics of drugs like capecitabine, a prodrug converted to 5-fluorouracil that targets cancer cells' DNA synthesis. This interaction might influence how both cancerous and normal cells with high mitochondrial activity metabolize the drug, possibly impacting its effectiveness or toxicity, though this hypothesis lacks direct evidence and requires clinical validation.
