The TOMM40 gene indirectly influences the effectiveness of Alzheimer's medications like donepezil and memantine through polymorphisms affecting pharmacodynamics, while for drugs such as ritonavir, atorvastatin, and warfarin, it potentially alters drug metabolism or efficacy by impacting mitochondrial function and health, crucially in liver cells where these drugs are metabolized. This showcases the complexity of pharmacogenetics where TOMM40 interactions with medications extend beyond direct enzyme-drug interactions to broader effects on mitochondrial health and cellular processes.
