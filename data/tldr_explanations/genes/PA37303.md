While the gene VEGFB does not have direct drug interactions, its association within the VEGF pathway plays a significant role in the pharmacogenetics of drugs like Sorafenib, an anti-angiogenic agent used in cancer therapy. Sorafenib does not target VEGFB directly but impacts it indirectly by affecting the VEGF pathway, which shares roles in vascular processes and angiogenesis, influencing VEGFB's function in endothelial maintenance and vascular integrity.
