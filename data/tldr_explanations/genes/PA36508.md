Mutations in the THRB gene, which codes for the thyroid hormone receptor beta, influence the effectiveness of thyroid hormone treatments such as levothyroxine, primarily by causing a resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) syndrome that necessitates tailored dosages for affected individuals. Although THRB's direct pharmacogenetic impact on salbutamol, a beta-2 agonist used in asthma treatment, is ambiguous, it may indirectly affect salbutamol's efficacy due to its roles in metabolic and cardiovascular regulation.
