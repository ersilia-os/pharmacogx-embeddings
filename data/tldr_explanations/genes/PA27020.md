CTPS1, important in nucleotide synthesis, impacts the metabolism and effectiveness of the chemotherapy drug ara-CTP, a cytarabine metabolite. Variations in CTPS1 activity affect the balance of nucleotides such as CTP, influencing how ara-CTP, which inhibits DNA polymerases, competes with natural nucleotides, impacting its efficacy and toxicity in cancer therapy.
