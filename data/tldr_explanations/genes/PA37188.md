UGT2B15 is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of numerous drugs including lorazepam, oxazepam, acetaminophen, and lamotrigine, primarily through the process of glucuronidation which aids in their excretion. Genetic variants in UGT2B15 can alter enzyme activity, impacting the effectiveness and toxicity of these drugs by affecting their plasma concentrations and systemic availability.
