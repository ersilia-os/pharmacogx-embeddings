Evinacumab, a drug that inhibits ANGPTL3, effectively lowers LDL cholesterol levels by targeting and neutralizing the function of the angiopoietin-like 3 protein, encoded by the ANGPTL3 gene. This interaction is particularly important in individuals with mutations in the ANGPTL3 gene, such as those with familial hypercholesterolemia, where standard therapies may be inadequate.
