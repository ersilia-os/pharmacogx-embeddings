The chemotherapeutic drug capecitabine, used in cancer treatment, may have a speculative and indirect pharmacodynamic interaction with the gene LMNTD1, related to the gene's role in cell signaling pathways rather than drug metabolism. This interaction possibly influences cancer cell responses to internal signals, not the pharmacokinetics of the drug, but direct evidence of this effect is absent.
