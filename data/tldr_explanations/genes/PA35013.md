SCO2, a gene involved in mitochondrial functionality, indirectly influences the effectiveness of drugs like capecitabine (converted into 5-fluorouracil) in patients with SCO2 mutations. This is because mutations in SCO2 can affect mitochondrial energy production, potentially altering the cellular conditions needed for the effective metabolism of capecitabine, though this interaction requires further clinical validation for confirmation.
