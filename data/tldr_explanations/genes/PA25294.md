BCHE gene variations significantly impact the metabolism and effectiveness of several drugs. For example, genetic variants like BCHE*K and BCHE*UUA lead to reduced enzyme activity, which prolongs the action of muscle relaxants such as succinylcholine and mivacurium during anesthesia, requiring dose adjustments. Additionally, BCHE activity influences the metabolism of drugs like cocaine and the effectiveness of Alzheimerâ€™s treatments such as rivastigmine and donepezil, potentially altering therapeutic outcomes based on individual genetic profiles.
