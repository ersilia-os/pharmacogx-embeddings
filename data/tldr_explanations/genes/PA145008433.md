METTL21A, known for its role in protein methylation, influences gene expression and protein function, potentially affecting the pharmacodynamics of drugs that alter chromatin dynamics and muscle physiology. Although there is no established link between METTL21A and the pharmacokinetics of citalopram, a drug associated with muscle side effects like weakness, further research might uncover METTL21A's involvement in modulating such pharmacodynamic interactions related to muscle effects.
