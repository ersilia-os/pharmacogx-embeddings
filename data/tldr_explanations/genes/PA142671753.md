FMO6P, a pseudogene, does not encode a functional protein and hence does not interact in the metabolism of drugs or affect drug actions in the body, unlike its functional counterparts like FMO3 and FMO5. This lack of function is due to evolutionary mutations that inhibit proper gene expression, rendering FMO6P inactive in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes.
