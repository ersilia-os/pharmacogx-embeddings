Drugs such as Rituximab, Ocrelizumab, Ofatumumab, and Ibritumomab target the CD20 antigen encoded by the MS4A1 gene, used in treating B-cell disorders. These monoclonal antibodies induce B cell depletion through complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, while Ibritumomab adds a radioactive isotope for direct B cell destruction.
