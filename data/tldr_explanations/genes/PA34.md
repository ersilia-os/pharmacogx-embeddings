The ADRA1A gene, which encodes for the alpha-1A adrenergic receptor involved in vasoconstriction and blood pressure regulation, interacts pharmacogenetically with alpha-1 blockers like prazosin, terazosin, and doxazosin. Genetic variants in ADRA1A affect the efficacy and side effects of these medications, potentially necessitating dosage adjustments or alternative treatments to manage hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia more effectively. Additionally, nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, may indirectly influence ADRA1Aâ€™s function or expression, though its primary action does not involve direct modulation of this receptor.
