The DRD4 gene, responsible for dopamine receptor activity, influences the pharmacodynamics of drugs like methylphenidate used in ADHD treatment, with variations in the gene affecting drug effectiveness. Moreover, DRD4 also impacts interactions with opioids like heroin by affecting the reward system's dopaminergic pathways, potentially altering addiction and dependency behaviors.
