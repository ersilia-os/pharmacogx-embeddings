The GRIA3 gene, which encodes for a component of AMPA receptors influential in neural transmission and plasticity, impacts the pharmacogenetic response to psychiatric drugs like citalopram and venlafaxine. Variations in GRIA3 affect interactions primarily through pharmacodynamic mechanisms, altering how these antidepressants, which influence serotonin and glutamatergic transmission, modulate synaptic activity and affect therapeutic outcomes.
