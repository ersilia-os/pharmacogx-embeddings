The EYS gene, which plays a critical role in retinal photoreceptor cell integrity, has no established pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs affecting metabolism or action, nor are there traditional pharmacological treatments that target EYS directly. Research into EYS primarily focuses on addressing genetic variations that contribute to retinal dystrophies, with therapeutic interventions exploring gene therapy to correct these defects and potentially reverse progression of diseases like autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP).
