Variations in the SERPINF1 gene, which encodes the anti-angiogenic protein PEDF, may influence the effectiveness or safety of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapies used in treating conditions such as cancer and age-related macular degeneration. This potential pharmacogenetic interaction primarily affects the pharmacodynamics of anti-VEGF drugs, impacting the biological pathways these drugs target.
