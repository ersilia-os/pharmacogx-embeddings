The pharmacogenetic profile of CERKL, primarily involved in retinal diseases, shows no direct, well-established drug interactions with common eye care medications, including iloperidone, an antipsychotic with uncertain connection to CERKL. This gene's relevance appears more pronounced in the potential development of gene therapies targeting retinal disease mechanisms rather than through interactions with traditional drugs like iloperidone, suggesting possible misclassification or an area requiring further research to establish any real pharmacogenetic interactions.
