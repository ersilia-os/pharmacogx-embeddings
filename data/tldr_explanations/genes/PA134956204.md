C18orf56, a gene with an unclear function, is speculated to potentially interact with drugs predominantly used in cancer treatment (such as prednisone, daunorubicin, epirubicin, vincristine, cytarabine, fluorouracil, capecitabine, methotrexate, and mercaptopurine) and might be involved in drug metabolism or resistance. Additionally, it may also interact with drugs used in autoimmune conditions (like asparaginase, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, azathioprine, and folic acid), potentially affecting immune responses or cell growth pathways, but these interactions remain unestablished and speculative.
