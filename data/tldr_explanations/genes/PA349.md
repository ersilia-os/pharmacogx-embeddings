Aspirin, an antiplatelet drug, indirectly reduces the activity of TBXAS1, a gene essential for thromboxane A2 production, by inhibiting COX-1 which decreases substrate availability for TBXAS1. Variations in TBXAS1 can therefore affect the drug's efficacy in preventing thrombotic events by altering the responsiveness of thromboxane A2 levels to aspirin therapy.
