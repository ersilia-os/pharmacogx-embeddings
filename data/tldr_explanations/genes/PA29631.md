Enasidenib selectively inhibits the mutant IDH2 enzyme in acute myeloid leukemia patients, preventing the production of the oncogenic metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate and countering its effects on cancer progression, illustrating a direct pharmacodynamic interaction. Although not a direct inhibitor, venetoclaxâ€™s effectiveness might also be modulated by alterations in metabolic pathways caused by IDH2 mutations, suggesting a potential pharmacodynamic involvement.
