Mutations in the NT5C2 gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in nucleotide metabolism, confer resistance to nucleoside analog chemotherapy drugs like mercaptopurine and thioguanine in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) by enhancing the enzyme's activity and accelerating drug metabolism, thereby reducing drug effectiveness. This gene may also affect the metabolism of other similar drugs such as gemcitabine and the antiretroviral didanosine, suggesting a pharmacokinetic interaction that compromises therapeutic efficacy through increased drug breakdown.
