The GNB3 gene influences the effectiveness of various drugs through its role in G protein-coupled receptor signaling, impacting cardiovascular and psychiatric drug responses. For example, genetic variations in GNB3 affect the efficacy of cardiovascular drugs like atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide, as well as psychiatric medications such as escitalopram and nortriptyline, due to differences in heart rate modulation, kidney function, and neurotransmitter signaling.
