The gene DCTD, which encodes deoxycytidylate deaminase involved in DNA synthesis, impacts the effectiveness and toxicity of cancer chemotherapy drugs like cytarabine and gemcitabine. Variants in DCTD can influence the metabolism and bioavailability of these drugs, directly affecting cytarabine by altering the conversion of its metabolites and possibly influencing gemcitabine's efficacy related to cellular nucleotide pools.
