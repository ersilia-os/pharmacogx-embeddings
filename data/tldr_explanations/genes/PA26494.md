Mutations in CHRNB1, which is important in forming nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, can influence the effectiveness and safety of drugs like pyridostigmine, used in treating congenital myasthenic syndromes by enhancing neuromuscular transmission through prolonging acetylcholine action. Similarly, varenicline, a partial agonist for similar receptors and primarily for smoking cessation, might have underexplored interactions with CHRNB1 that could affect neuromuscular functions.
