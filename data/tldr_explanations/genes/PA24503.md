ADA (Adenosine Deaminase) plays a critical role in purine metabolism that affects the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of several drugs. Specifically, ADA interacts pharmacogenetically with Pegademase bovine (Adagen) to treat ADA-linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) by compensating for the lack of ADA activity and improving clinical outcomes. Furthermore, drugs like azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, as well as methotrexate, also interact with ADA, influencing their efficacy and toxicity through mechanisms linked to ADA's enzymatic or cellular metabolic roles.
