The NAT2 gene encodes an enzyme crucial for the metabolism of various drugs through N-acetylation, influencing their pharmacokinetics and toxicity. Variants in NAT2 affect the metabolism of drugs like isoniazid, hydralazine, procainamide, sulfamethoxazole, and pyrazinamide, leading to differences in acetylator status (rapid, intermediate, slow) among individuals, which impacts drug plasma levels, exposure duration, and risk of adverse effects such as increased toxicity and drug-induced lupus.
