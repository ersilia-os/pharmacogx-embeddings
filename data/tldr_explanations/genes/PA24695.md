Variants in the ALDH1B1 gene, which plays a crucial role in the metabolism of ethanol and the detoxification of acetaldehyde, potentially modify how individuals metabolize and respond to alcohol, impacting treatments for alcohol use disorder and alcoholic liver disease. Although specific drug interactions with ALDH1B1 are not well-documented, the gene's role in managing oxidative stress may influence the pharmacodynamics of drugs targeting oxidative damage within cells.
