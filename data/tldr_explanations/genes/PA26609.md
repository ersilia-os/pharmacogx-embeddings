Variations in the CLOCK gene, which regulates circadian rhythms, affect the pharmacodynamics of psychiatric medications, leading to different clinical outcomes with drugs such as antipsychotics and mood stabilizers. Drugs like salbutamol and fluvoxamine may interact with CLOCK by affecting circadian modulation of receptor activity or neurotransmitter pathways, impacting therapeutic outcomes and side effects through pharmacodynamic rather than pharmacokinetic pathways.
