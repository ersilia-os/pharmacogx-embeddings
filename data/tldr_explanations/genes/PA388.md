The SLC22A6 gene, or OAT1, plays a significant role in the renal clearance of drugs such as tenofovir, adefovir dipivoxil, and cidofovir by mediating their transport into the urine, which is crucial for controlling drug levels in the body. Variants in SLC22A6 can affect the transport efficiency of these antiviral agents, leading to different blood concentrations, potentially impacting therapeutic effectiveness and increasing the risk of nephrotoxicity and other side effects.
