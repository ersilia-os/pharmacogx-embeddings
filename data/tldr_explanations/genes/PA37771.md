Variations in the SLC2A9 gene, which encodes the GLUT9 uric acid transporter, affect the pharmacodynamics of allopurinol and potentially the mechanism of furosemide in managing conditions related to uric acid levels. Allopurinol's effectiveness can vary based on SLC2A9 polymorphisms that influence uric acid levels, requiring dosage adjustments, while the impact of SLC2A9 on furosemide primarily involves changes in uric acid excretion, though the exact process needs clarification.
