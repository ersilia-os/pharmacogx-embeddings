Sorafenib, a kinase inhibitor used for renal and hepatocellular carcinoma, may interact indirectly with the MAP2K6 gene, a component of the p38 MAPK signal pathway. This interaction, falling under pharmacodynamics, might affect the drug's efficacy and toxicity based on the expression or mutations in MAP2K6, highlighting its importance in personalized medicine for cancers where MAPK pathways are deregulated.
