PON3, which exerts an influence on drug metabolism and effects particularly for drugs involved in lipid modulation and oxidative stress, may affect the pharmacodynamics of cardiovascular drugs like statins or anti-inflammatory medications through its role in preventing lipid peroxidation and its antioxidant properties. Despite this, there is currently no direct evidence linking specific drugs to pharmacogenetic interactions with the PON3 gene, and these interactions are hypothesized based on the enzymeâ€™s biological functions rather than proven clinical data.
