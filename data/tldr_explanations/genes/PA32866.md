The P2RX7 gene, a purinergic receptor involved in inflammation and apoptosis, is critical in pharmacogenetics because its variants can alter the effectiveness of drugs targeting inflammatory pathways, like treatments for rheumatoid arthritis. For example, variants in P2RX7 may affect the therapeutic effectiveness of fentanyl, an opioid pain medication, by modulating pain signals through inflammatory pathways, without influencing the drug's pharmacokinetics such as absorption or metabolism.
