XBP1, particularly its spliced form XBP1s, plays a significant role in pharmacogenetics by altering the efficacy of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, used in treating multiple myeloma, by affecting plasma cells' survival. Additionally, there may be an interaction between XBP1 and valproic acid, suggesting a potential non-pharmacokinetic influence on XBP1 activity or expression, although this relationship is less clear and not as directly related to XBP1's primary functions.
