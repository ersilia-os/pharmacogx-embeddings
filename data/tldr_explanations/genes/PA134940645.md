Drugs that affect endocytic or exocytic pathways, as well as those used in treating neurological disorders and modulating autophagy, could have altered efficacy or side effects in patients with genetic variations in RABGAP1L. This is because RABGAP1L plays a role in vesicle trafficking, autophagy, and cellular trafficking, influencing how drugs are taken up, distributed, or eliminated by cells.
