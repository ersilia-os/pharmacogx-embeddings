The gene RRM2, crucial for DNA synthesis, impacts the effectiveness of certain chemotherapeutic drugs, such as gemcitabine, cladribine, and cytarabine by influencing deoxyribonucleotide pools or DNA synthesis processes that these drugs target. Overexpression of RRM2 is linked with resistance, modifying drug efficacy through direct pharmacodynamic interactions, suggesting the importance of monitoring RRM2 levels in personalized cancer treatment.
