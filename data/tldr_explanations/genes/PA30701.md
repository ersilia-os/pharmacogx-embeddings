The drug epirubicin, a chemotherapy agent that induces DNA damage, may have its efficacy and toxicity affected by variations in the MCPH1 gene, which is involved in DNA repair mechanisms. In contrast, perphenazine, an antipsychotic, lacks a direct connection to MCPH1's role in DNA repair, indicating no clear pharmacogenetic interaction.
