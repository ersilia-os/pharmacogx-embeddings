SNX9, a gene involved in vesicle formation and endocytosis, might theoretically affect the efficacy or side effects of drugs like metoprolol and atenolol by altering cellular internalization processes, although these beta-blockers do not primarily rely on intracellular trafficking for their action or metabolism. Thus, any potential interaction with SNX9 would be speculative and not based on pharmacokinetic principles, with a more significant impact possible for drugs that undergo extensive intracellular processing or require cellular uptake of active metabolites.
