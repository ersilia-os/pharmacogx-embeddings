The CTLA4 gene plays a critical role in pharmacogenetics, particularly influencing the effectiveness and safety of ipilimumab, a cancer immunotherapy drug that blocks CTLA4 to enhance immune responses against cancer. Genetic variations in CTLA4 may also affect the action of other drugs, such as tacrolimus and non-pharmacokinetic medications like sunitinib and methotrexate, by possibly altering immune modulation and impacting drug efficacy and safety in treatments involving immune system regulation.
