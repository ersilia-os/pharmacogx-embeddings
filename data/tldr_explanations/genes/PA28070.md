The FCN2 gene plays a role in immune system processes through its encoding of a protein that activates the lectin pathway, essential for immune surveillance and pathogen clearance, potentially affecting the efficacy and safety of immunomodulatory drugs and treatments for infectious diseases. Although the relationship between FCN2 and duloxetine, an antidepressant, is noted, it suggests a speculative, non-pharmacokinetic interaction possibly related to immune modulation, but lacks clear biological documentation or evidence.
