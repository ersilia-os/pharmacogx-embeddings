Drugs like denosumab, which target the RANKL pathway, and aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole and letrozole, used in breast cancer treatment, interact with the gene TNFRSF11B. The gene encodes for osteoprotegerin, influencing bone metabolism and the efficacy and safety of these drugs; pharmacogenetic variations in TNFRSF11B could be pivotal in predicting treatment outcomes, particularly concerning bone density changes.
