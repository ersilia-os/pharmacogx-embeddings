The gene KCNQ5, which influences neuronal and cardiac excitability, has pharmacogenetic implications particularly in the context of neurological diseases, with significant interactions noted with the antiepileptic drug retigabine. Retigabine activates KCNQ5 channels to enhance M-current flow, thereby contributing to its effectiveness in managing epilepsy by suppressing convulsions.
