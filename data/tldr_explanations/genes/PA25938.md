The gene TRAF3IP2 interacts with drugs that target the NF-ÎºB and MAPK pathways, such as TNF inhibitors commonly used for treating inflammatory conditions, due to its role in modulating immune and inflammatory responses. There is no direct pharmacogenetic link established between TRAF3IP2 and nevirapine, an antiretroviral drug for HIV, suggesting the interaction may be associative, influencing drug efficacy through immune system effects.
