Drugs such as spironolactone, eplerenone, and canrenone, which are mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, interact with the NR3C2 gene by blocking its receptor activity, impacting the effects of aldosterone. This interaction can modify drug effectiveness and side effects due to genetic variations in NR3C2. Moreover, enalapril and cocaine may also exhibit altered effects in individuals with specific NR3C2 mutations, affecting cardiovascular and stress response pathways.
