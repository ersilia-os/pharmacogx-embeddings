The HOMER1 gene, important in regulating synaptic function, may indirectly impact the effectiveness and side effects of neuropsychiatric drugs such as levodopa, a treatment for Parkinson's disease. While levodopa primarily targets dopaminergic pathways, its influence on glutamatergic pathways may be modulated by HOMER1, affecting synaptic plasticity and neural excitability, which could vary based on individual genetic variations in HOMER1.
