RRAS2, a gene involved in the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway critical for cellular functions, may influence the efficacy of MEK inhibitors and potentially interact with tamoxifen. Though primarily acting through estrogen receptor blockade, tamoxifen's effectiveness could also be modulated by pathways involving cell motility and adhesion, where RRAS2 is relevant. These interactions suggest that variations in the RRAS2 gene could affect how cancer cells respond to these drugs.
