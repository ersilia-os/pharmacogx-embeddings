The gene ADO, involved in the taurine biosynthesis pathway, may influence the pharmacodynamics of drugs like hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic used to control hypertension. Since ADO affects taurine levels important in osmoregulation and kidney metabolism, genetic variations in ADO could potentially alter the effectiveness and side effects of hydrochlorothiazide, particularly in terms of fluid retention and electrolyte management.
