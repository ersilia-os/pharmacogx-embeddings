SPATA9 primarily influences spermatogenesis and has a speculative pharmacogenetic interaction with methotrexate, a drug used primarily in cancer and autoimmune disease treatment, but also in ectopic pregnancy management. This interaction is thought to be pharmacodynamic, potentially affecting cell division and reproduction in tissues where SPATA9 is expressed, largely impacting spermatogenesis and related reproductive functions.
