NEUROD1 involves in insulin synthesis and neuronal differentiation and may influence the pharmacodynamics of diabetes treatments such as repaglinide and sulfonylureas, which act by stimulating insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. Although the effects of NEUROD1 variants on these drug interactions are not well-documented, the gene's role suggests that genetic variations could impact the effectiveness of these treatments by affecting beta-cell function and insulin regulation.
