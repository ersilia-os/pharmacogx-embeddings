In hematological cancers such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the ETV6 gene is involved in genetic translocations that create the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion protein, affecting chemotherapy treatments by influencing decisions about treatment intensity and choice. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like imatinib target pathways altered by ETV6 fusion proteins, affecting drug efficacy by modulating pathological signaling pathways, primarily through pharmacodynamic interactions.
