The CAT gene, which helps decompose hydrogen peroxide and mitigate oxidative stress, indirectly affects the efficacy and toxicity of drugs through patient responses to oxidative stress, rather than through direct pharmacogenetic interactions. This impacts drugs like the chemotherapy agents doxorubicin and cisplatin, which produce reactive oxygen species, and antioxidant drugs used for cardiovascular diseases, where variations in CAT gene expression can alter drug effectiveness.
