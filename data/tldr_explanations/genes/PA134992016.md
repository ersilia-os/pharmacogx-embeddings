Although there are no direct pharmacogenetic interactions established between the gene CXXC4 and specific drugs, CXXC4's significant role in regulating the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway indicates potential indirect effects on the efficacy of drugs targeting this pathway, such as those used in treating cancers like colorectal cancer where Wnt signaling is often dysregulated. The effectiveness of these drugs may differ based on individual genetic variations in CXXC4 expression or function, suggesting the gene's potential influence in personalized cancer therapy targeting the Wnt pathway.
