Although the PLGLB1 gene is structurally similar to plasminogen and is involved in the fibrinolytic system, there are no direct pharmacogenetic interactions documented with specific drugs, including thrombolytics like alteplase or streptokinase. The gene's influence on drug behavior, including drugs used in the management of myocardial infarction and stroke, remains speculative without clinical evidence linking PLGLB1 to the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of these drugs.
