RAD52, a gene that contributes to DNA repair, interacts pharmacogenetically with hydrochlorothiazide and cyclophosphamide, affecting therapeutic outcomes especially in cancer treatments with cyclophosphamide. This interaction occurs not through direct alteration of the drugs' pharmacokinetics by RAD52, but rather indirectly through its role in DNA repair pathways, which can impact the effectiveness of cyclophosphamide therapy in cancers, while the interaction with hydrochlorothiazide remains less clearly defined.
