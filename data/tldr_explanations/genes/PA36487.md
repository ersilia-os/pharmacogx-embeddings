Drugs that inhibit TGF-beta, used in certain cancer treatments, may vary in effectiveness based on the expression of TGFBR3, because it influences the presentation of TGF-beta ligands to signaling receptors. Therefore, the level or functionality of TGFBR3 affects the pharmacodynamics of these drugs, impacting the sensitivity of cancer cells to treatments that target the TGF-beta pathway.
