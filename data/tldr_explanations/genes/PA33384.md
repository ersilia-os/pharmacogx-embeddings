Variants in the PLCB1 gene, which is involved in intracellular signaling through GPCR activity, might affect the pharmacodynamics of drugs that target GPCR pathways, impacting the effectiveness of neurological or psychiatric therapies. Although the interaction between PLCB1 and drugs like irinotecan, a topoisomerase inhibitor, is suggested, the precise mechanism or relevance of this interaction remains unclear and may be indirect, requiring further investigation into its neurological or side effect implications.
