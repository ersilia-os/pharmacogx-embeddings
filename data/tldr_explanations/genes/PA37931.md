The TAS2R16 gene, which encodes bitter taste receptors, plays a role in pharmacogenetics by influencing how bitter compounds, including some medications, are perceived, primarily through pharmacodynamic interactions. This variation in bitterness perception can affect patient compliance with medication, particularly among taste-sensitive populations like children and the elderly; thus, understanding these genetic variations can help in tailoring strategies like flavor masking to enhance medication acceptance and ensure effective treatment outcomes.
