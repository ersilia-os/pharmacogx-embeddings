ALG10, a glycosyltransferase in the N-glycosylation pathway, indirectly influences the pharmacodynamics of drugs like gemcitabine by affecting glycoprotein folding and maturation. Although speculative, the role of ALG10 might be significant in modifying how glycoproteins interact with or transport gemcitabine, potentially impacting the drug's efficacy or safety.
