NT5C3A, a gene involved in metabolizing nucleotide-like molecules, significantly affects the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cancer therapy drugs, particularly nucleoside analogs such as gemcitabine. Variations in NT5C3A activity can change the effectiveness and toxicity of these drugs by altering the levels and duration of their active metabolites in the body, potentially influencing treatment outcomes and side effects.
