Roflumilast, targeting the PDE4D gene, inhibits its activity to increase cAMP levels, yielding anti-inflammatory effects essential for treating COPD symptoms. The gene's role in cAMP degradation also suggests a speculative pharmacodynamic interaction with quetiapine, an antipsychotic, due to its influence on neurotransmitter pathways potentially modulated by PDE4D, though evidence of a direct interaction is lacking.
