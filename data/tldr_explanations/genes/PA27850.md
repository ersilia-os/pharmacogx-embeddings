The efficiency of the ERCC4 gene in DNA repair influences the effectiveness of the chemotherapy drugs fluorouracil and oxaliplatin, used for cancer treatment. Variations in ERCC4 may increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to these drugs by impairing DNA repair, enhancing their cytotoxic effects, while proficient DNA repair due to ERCC4 might contribute to drug resistance.
