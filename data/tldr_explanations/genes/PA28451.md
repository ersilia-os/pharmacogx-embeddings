The gene ACKR1 influences the interaction with the antipsychotic drug clozapine primarily through pharmacodynamic mechanisms, potentially impacting the drug's immune-related side effects, like agranulocytosis. This effect is due to ACKR1's role in modulating immune cell trafficking and inflammation, rather than affecting the pharmacokinetics of clozapine.
