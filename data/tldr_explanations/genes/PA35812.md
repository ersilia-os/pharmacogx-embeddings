SLC15A2, a gene encoding a peptide transporter, significantly influences the pharmacokinetics of drugs like Î²-lactam antibiotics through its role in drug absorption and excretion, particularly in the kidneys. Variations in this gene can alter the plasma levels and efficacy of these antibiotics due to their structural similarities with peptides and shared transport mechanisms. Additionally, drugs like sorafenib and warfarin, although not peptide-based, may also be affected in their distribution or excretion patterns by changes in SLC15A2 function or expression, impacting their pharmacokinetic profiles.
