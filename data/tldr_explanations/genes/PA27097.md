The drugs telaprevir, deferasirox, and daclatasvir may interact with the CYP24A1 enzyme, which is crucial for metabolizing vitamin D, thereby potentially affecting the bioavailability of active vitamin D levels and altering drug metabolism. This understanding is important for predicting drug efficacy and safety, which may necessitate adjustments in dosage and treatment monitoring based on individual genetic variations in CYP24A1 activity.
