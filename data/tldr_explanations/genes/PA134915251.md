TXNDC11, involved in the oxidative stress response and protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum, may influence the effectiveness or toxicity of drugs treating cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases due to these conditionsâ€™ reliance on oxidative or ER stress pathways. While not directly targeted by drugs like hydrochlorothiazide, TXNDC11 variations might affect these drugs' impact, particularly by exacerbating drug-induced oxidative stress, suggesting a potential indirect pharmacogenetic interaction.
