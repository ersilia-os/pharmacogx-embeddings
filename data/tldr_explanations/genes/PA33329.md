Variations in the PIP5K1C gene, which plays a crucial role in brain function and synaptic activities, might impact the pharmacodynamics of neuropsychiatric drugs used in treating disorders like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Additionally, PIP5K1C variations could potentially alter the efficacy or toxicity of drugs affecting insulin signaling and cardiovascular functions, although direct correlations with specific drugs are not conclusively established and remain speculative.
