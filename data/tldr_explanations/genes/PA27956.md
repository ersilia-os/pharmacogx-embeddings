Fenofibrate, a drug used for managing hyperlipidemia, interacts with FABP1, a gene involved in the intracellular transport of lipids. Variants in FABP1 could affect the drug's effectiveness by influencing the activation of PPARα, a key pathway in fatty acid metabolism affected by FABP1, thus altering fenofibrate’s therapeutic efficacy in lowering lipid levels.
