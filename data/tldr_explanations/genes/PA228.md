Variants in the LEP gene, which encodes leptin, impact the effectiveness and side effects of metreleptin, a drug for treating generalized lipodystrophy, by altering its interaction with leptin signaling pathways. Additionally, drugs like isotretinoin, tacrolimus, risperidone, olanzapine, and clozapine may indirectly affect weight and metabolism potentially through leptin-modulated mechanisms, influencing their therapeutic outcomes and metabolic side effect profiles.
