YBX1 significantly contributes to chemotherapy resistance by decreasing sensitivity to drugs such as cisplatin in ovarian cancer through enhanced DNA repair and increased anti-apoptotic proteins, and by promoting resistance to doxorubicin and docetaxel in breast cancer, likely via altered drug transporter and apoptosis gene expression. Additionally, YBX1's potential interaction with abiraterone in prostate cancer, though not clinically established, might be influenced by its modulation of gene expression pathways such as PI3K/Akt and MAPK, critical to steroidogenesis, which is relevant to abiraterone's action.
