The PDE4B gene, encoding Phosphodiesterase 4B, is targeted by PDE4 inhibitors such as rolipram, roflumilast, and apremilast to treat inflammatory conditions by increasing cAMP levels, moderating inflammatory pathways, and reducing cytokine production. While ritodrine primarily acts as a beta-agonist and not directly as a PDE4B inhibitor, its role in cAMP pathways suggests potential indirect pharmacodynamic interactions with the PDE4B gene, affecting its efficacy in delaying premature labor.
