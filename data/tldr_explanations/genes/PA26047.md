The CALU gene, encoding for the calcium-binding protein calumenin, might impact the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulant drugs such as warfarin and acenocoumarol. This potential interaction, rooted in CALU's role in coagulation processes, could affect the pharmacodynamics of these drugs by modulating their action on the coagulation cascade, thereby influencing their therapeutic outcomes.
