MTHFR genetic variants impact the efficacy and toxicity of drugs like folic acid, methotrexate, and capecitabine by affecting folate metabolism and homocysteine levels. Folic acid supplementation can address elevated homocysteine levels, while MTHFR mutations can alter methotrexate processing and enhance or reduce capecitabine activation, influencing drug dosages and resulting pharmacodynamic outcomes. Additionally, drugs such as phenytoin and carbamazepine exhibit non-metabolic interactions with MTHFR variants through effects on folate homeostasis, which may affect drug effectiveness and side-effect profiles.
