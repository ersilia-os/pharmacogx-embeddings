The BCR gene is significant in pharmacogenetics largely due to its involvement in creating the BCR-ABL fusion protein in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like Imatinib, Dasatinib, Nilotinib, Ponatinib, and Bosutinib target this protein's aberrant activity by binding to its ATP-binding site, effectively inhibiting its kinase activity and providing therapeutic effects. Asciminib, meanwhile, binds to the BCR-ABL protein's myristoyl site and acts as a selective inhibitor, helping to manage resistance or intolerance to other TKIs.
