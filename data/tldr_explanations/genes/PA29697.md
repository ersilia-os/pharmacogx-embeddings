Variations in the IGF1 gene, which encodes a hormone important for growth and development, affect individual responses to growth hormone therapies used for conditions like growth hormone deficiency and Turner syndrome. The effectiveness of these treatments can vary because different IGF1 gene variants influence the hormone's production or activity, interacting with the therapies at a pharmacodynamic level through cellular growth and proliferation pathways.
