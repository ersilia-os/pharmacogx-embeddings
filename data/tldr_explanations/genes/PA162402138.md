Atenolol, a beta-blocker, has a possible non-pharmacokinetic interaction with the gene RRP1B, which is involved in ribosomal RNA processing and protein synthesis essential for cell proliferation. However, no well-documented pharmacogenetic associations between RRP1B and atenolol or other drugs are currently established, with any suggested interactions stemming more from systemic effects rather than direct links.
