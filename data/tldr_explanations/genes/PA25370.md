The BLMH gene encodes an enzyme crucial for the inactivation and detoxification of bleomycin, a drug used for treating Hodgkin lymphoma and testicular cancer. Genetic variations in BLMH that decrease enzyme activity can lead to increased risk and severity of toxic side effects like pulmonary fibrosis from bleomycin. While also mentioned in relation to etoposide, the interaction between BLMH and etoposide is not clearly defined and primarily pharmacokinetic.
