Simvastatin and pravastatin, while primarily used for lowering cholesterol, may influence RHOA-mediated pathways which affect cellular dynamics like cell motility and proliferation, particularly in oncology. This interaction could suggest broader therapeutic applications for these drugs, potentially aiding in cancer treatments by modulating crucial processes involved in cancer cell migration and invasion.
