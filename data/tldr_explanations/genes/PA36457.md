Variations in the Transferrin (TF) gene affect iron binding and transport, which can influence the pharmacokinetics and effectiveness of drugs that interact with iron, such as iron supplements and therapies for conditions like anemia or iron overload. Additionally, TF gene variations could indirectly affect the efficacy and safety of warfarin—the anticoagulant—by altering iron homeostasis, which in turn impacts liver function and warfarin metabolism.
