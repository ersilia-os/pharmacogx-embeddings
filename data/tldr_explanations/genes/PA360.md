The UGT2B4 gene is crucial in the metabolism and excretion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) by converting them into water-soluble glucuronide conjugates, impacting their clearance and action duration. Variations in this gene affect the drug levels in the body, influencing the efficacy and safety of NSAID treatments, potentially leading to reduced effectiveness or an increased risk of adverse effects like gastrointestinal bleeding.
