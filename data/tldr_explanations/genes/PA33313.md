PIK3R2 mutations impact the effectiveness of PI3K inhibitors such as copanlisib and idelalisib by influencing the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which these drugs target to inhibit tumor growth and survival. Additionally, PIK3R2 affects the pharmacodynamics of chemotherapy agents like fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide, modulating their effects through the same signaling pathways, thereby influencing the outcomes of cancer therapies.
