DVL2 indirectly affects the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors—gefitinib, afatinib, and erlotinib—used in treating non-small cell lung cancer by modulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which influences cell proliferation and differentiation. This indirect interaction impacts how cancer cells respond to these drugs, potentially altering their effectiveness or resistance, without directly changing the drugs' pharmacokinetics.
