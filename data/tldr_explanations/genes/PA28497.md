Drugs such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and general anesthetics indirectly interact with the GABRB3 gene by modulating GABA_A receptors, to which they bind and enhance GABAergic activity. These interactions, affecting GABA-mediated synaptic transmission, likely influence the function of the beta3 subunit encoded by GABRB3, focusing on pharmacodynamics rather than pharmacokinetics.
