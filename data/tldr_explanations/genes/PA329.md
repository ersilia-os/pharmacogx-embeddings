The gene SLC22A1, encoding for the organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1), significantly influences the absorption and distribution of various drugs, such as metformin, tramadol, lamotrigine, ondansetron, rasagiline, and imatinib, by affecting their hepatic uptake. Genetic variations in SLC22A1 can lead to different efficacy and safety profiles for these drugs, necessitating potential dosage adjustments in the management of conditions like diabetes, pain, epilepsy, nausea, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, and chronic myeloid leukemia.
