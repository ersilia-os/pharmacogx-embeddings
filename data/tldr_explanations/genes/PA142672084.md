Statins such as atorvastatin and rosuvastatin interact with the COQ2 gene, which is crucial for coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) biosynthesis, essential for mitochondrial energy production. This interaction, by impeding CoQ10 production through the inhibition of the mevalonate pathway, can lead to statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS), especially in individuals with specific COQ2 genetic variants that predispose them to lower CoQ10 levels, thereby affecting muscle function and energy dynamics.
