The DDRGK1 gene, involved in key cellular pathways such as the unfolded protein response and endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, potentially influences the pharmacodynamics of drugs like the immunosuppressants azathioprine and mercaptopurine through its role in NF-kappaB signaling, and of antiviral drugs such as telaprevir, ribavirin, and zidovudine through its involvement in cellular stress responses. These potential pharmacogenetic interactions suggest that genetic variations in DDRGK1 could impact the efficacy and safety of these drugs in patients.
