Currently, no pharmacogenetic interactions involving the CHST7 gene, which encodes a sulfotransferase that affects the sulfation of chondroitin, are documented. While the gene's role suggests potential drug interactions in diseases like osteoarthritis that involve connective tissues, specific drugs linked to genetic variations in CHST7 that could impact treatment efficacy or safety remain unidentified.
