CYP2A6, an enzyme from the cytochrome P450 superfamily, influences the metabolism of various drugs, impacting their efficacy and toxicity due to genetic variations. It plays a critical role in metabolizing smoking cessation aids like nicotine, cancer treatments such as cyclophosphamide and tegafur, HIV treatment efavirenz, and the glaucoma drug pilocarpine, necessitating dosage adjustments or changes in drug choices to optimize outcomes and minimize side effects.
