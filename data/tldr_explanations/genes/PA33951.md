Genetic variations in the PTH gene can affect the efficacy of teriparatide, a drug used in osteoporosis treatment, by altering how well it mimics the natural hormone's effects on bone formation and calcium regulation. Additionally, dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, may affect calcium absorption and bone metabolism indirectly through its impact on PTH gene expression, thereby influencing the biological environment of PTH and potentially altering the effectiveness of treatments like teriparatide.
