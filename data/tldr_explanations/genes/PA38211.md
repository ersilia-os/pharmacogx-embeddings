TMEM8A may interact with the opioid analgesics fentanyl and remifentanil through non-pharmacokinetic mechanisms, possibly affecting signaling pathways or cellular transport related to opioid efficacy or tolerance. This could influence the drugs' response in pain management and anesthesia, although the specific effects of TMEM8A on the pharmacodynamics of these opioids have yet to be fully clarified.
