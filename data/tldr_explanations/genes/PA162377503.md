BEST3, known for its role in chloride channel functioning and cellular ion homeostasis, does not directly interact with drugs in a typical pharmacogenetic manner. However, variations in BEST3 could hypothetically affect the effectiveness or side effects of drugs like hydrochlorothiazide—a diuretic acting on kidney function—by altering chloride ion movement in renal epithelial cells where BEST3 is involved, although this potential impact would be indirect and not based on direct pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions.
