Variations in the SIK3 gene, which plays a role in lipid and glucose metabolism through the AMPK signaling pathway, may impact the effectiveness of metabolic disorder drugs like metformin, which activates AMPK. These genetic variations potentially affect the pharmacodynamics of such drugs, influencing their efficacy in treating conditions like type 2 diabetes and obesity based on individual genetic differences.
