Phenytoin, a drug used for managing seizures, is suggested to have an interaction with the CFHR4 gene, which is involved in the complement system regulation. The interaction is thought to involve phenytoin's immunomodulatory effects, potentially influencing immune responses and inflammation through indirect pathways linked to the complement system, rather than altering CFHR4 activity directly.
