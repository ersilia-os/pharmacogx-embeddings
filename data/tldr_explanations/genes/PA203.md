Variants in the IRS1 gene, involved in insulin signaling, can impact the effectiveness of drugs like metformin, which is used for managing type 2 diabetes by affecting insulin sensitivity and glucose control. Additionally, IRS1 may also influence the pharmacodynamics of various cancer treatment drugs, such as clopidogrel, epirubicin, aspirin, fluorouracil, and cyclophosphamide, potentially altering their therapeutic effects and side effect profiles due to its role in metabolic pathways and cell regulation.
