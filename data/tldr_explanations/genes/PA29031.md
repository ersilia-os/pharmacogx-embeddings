GSTZ1, or Glutathione S-transferase zeta 1, plays a critical role in drug metabolism by detoxifying harmful compounds, including medications, through conjugation with glutathione. Variants in the GSTZ1 gene can affect enzyme activity, thus influencing the metabolism and effectiveness of certain drugs such as dichloroacetic acid used in lactic acidosis treatment, potentially impacting therapeutic outcomes and adverse reactions.
