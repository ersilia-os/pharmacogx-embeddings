The MICA gene affects the pharmacodynamics of drugs like ipilimumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab, immune checkpoint inhibitors used in cancer therapy, by potentially altering the drugs' effectiveness in engaging the immune system based on its expression and variant type. Additionally, the anticonvulsant carbamazepine may also influence MICA expression, thereby impacting immune system responsiveness and modifying the drug's effects, although its interaction with MICA is less directly understood.
