Drugs that target GABA_A receptors, like benzodiazepines, potentially interact with the GABRP gene as it encodes a subunit of these receptors which are key in managing conditions like anxiety and insomnia. Venlafaxine, primarily an SNRI used to treat depression and anxiety, interacts with the GABRP gene not through pharmacokinetic pathways but possibly through pharmacodynamic mechanisms, where alterations in GABA receptor function modulated by GABRP could influence the drug's therapeutic effects or side-effects profile.
