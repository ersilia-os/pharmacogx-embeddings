CYP4Z1, part of the Cytochrome P450 family, primarily expressed in mammary gland tissues, might influence the efficacy or toxicity of certain anticancer agents by modulating lipid pathways or eicosanoids, though specific drugs interacting with this enzyme are not yet identified. Its significant role in breast cancer could alter how drugs affect cell signaling and metabolic regulation, impacting therapy responses in hormone-sensitive cancers.
