The OPRM1 gene, encoding the mu-opioid receptor, significantly influences the reaction to opioids like morphine, fentanyl, methadone, buprenorphine, and others, due to its pharmacodynamic role in mediating pain perception and addiction pathways. Variants such as the A118G polymorphism impact this gene's binding affinity, thus altering the effectiveness and risk of side effects or addiction associated with these drugs, highlighting the need for personalized medicine in treatment strategies.
