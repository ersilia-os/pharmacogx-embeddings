SLIT1, a gene involved in neurodevelopment, may affect the metabolism or distribution of etoposide by influencing cellular mechanisms related to the drugâ€™s bioavailability or clearance. It is also hypothesized to affect the response to hydrochlorothiazide in a non-pharmacokinetic way, potentially through mechanisms like vascular remodeling or electrolyte balance influenced by neuronal signals mediated by SLIT1.
