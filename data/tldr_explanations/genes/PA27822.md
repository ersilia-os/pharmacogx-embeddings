EPHA7, a gene encoding the Ephrin Type-A Receptor 7 tyrosine kinase, is highlighted as a potential target in cancer therapy but lacks extensive pharmacogenetic interactions directly with therapeutic drugs. The gene's significance does not involve altering the pharmacokinetics of warfarin but may influence warfarin's effects or sensitivity through indirect mechanisms related to its role in cellular communication and vascular development, although the specific pharmacodynamic interactions with warfarin remain speculative.
