Variations in the ST13 gene, which influences the heat shock protein 70 family, could potentially affect the efficacy or toxicity of drugs targeting protein misfolding or cellular stress responses, such as geldanamycin derivatives used in cancer treatment. These hypothetical pharmacogenetic interactions suggest that different responses to such drugs might be observed depending on individual variations in ST13 function, though empirical evidence is currently lacking.
