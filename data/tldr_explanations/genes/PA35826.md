SLC1A1, the gene encoding the EAAT3 transporter involved in glutamate regulation, interacts pharmacogenetically with antipsychotics such as risperidone, olanzapine, and clozapine. These drugs, while primarily targeting dopamine and serotonin neurotransmitter systems, may also impact glutamatergic pathways by modulating glutamate levels, thereby affecting synaptic transmission and neuronal excitation in psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia and OCD, potentially altering drug efficacy and side effect profiles through non-pharmacokinetic mechanisms.
