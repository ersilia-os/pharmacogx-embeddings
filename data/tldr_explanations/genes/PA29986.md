Drugs like gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) influence the function of the JAG1 gene by preventing Notch receptor activation, affecting conditions such as leukemia and breast cancer. Additionally, Maralixibat's effect in treating pruritus in Alagille syndrome patients may be influenced by JAG1's role in liver pathology, suggesting a possible non-pharmacokinetic interaction that stems from the gene's impact on liver condition and thus on the drug's efficacy.
