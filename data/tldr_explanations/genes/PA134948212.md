Drugs like carboplatin and gemcitabine, used in cancer treatment, indirectly affect the function of the ATAT1 gene, which is critical for the stability of microtubules, by disrupting microtubule dynamics and DNA replication mechanisms. This indirect interaction may impact the efficacy of these drugs and lead to variations in patient responses based on differences in ATAT1 expression levels or genetic variants.
