The gene TAPBP, which is crucial in the antigen presentation pathway, does not show a direct pharmacogenetic interaction with aspirin. Aspirin's primary action involves inhibiting COX enzymes to reduce inflammation and thrombosis, and any possible connection with TAPBP would be more about general immunomodulatory effects rather than direct interactions with the gene's protein product.
