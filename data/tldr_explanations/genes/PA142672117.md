The gene CHIA, associated with acidic mammalian chitinase, does not directly interact with drugs such as aspirin, which works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase enzymes for its anti-inflammatory effects. However, variations in CHIA could indirectly affect the efficacy or side effects of anti-inflammatory treatments in conditions like asthma and allergic inflammation by modulating immune responses, rather than altering drug pharmacokinetics.
