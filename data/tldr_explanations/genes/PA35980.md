The efficacy of methylphenidate, used for ADHD, and amisulpride, an antipsychotic for schizophrenia, may be influenced by polymorphisms in the SNAP25 gene due to its role in synaptic neurotransmitter release and modulation. These pharmacodynamic interactions suggest that genetic variations in SNAP25 could alter the effects of these drugs on neurotransmitter dynamics, impacting drug effectiveness.
