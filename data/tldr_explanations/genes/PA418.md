The UPB1 gene, which is crucial in breaking down pyrimidines like uracil and thymine, affects the metabolism of pyrimidine analogues such as the chemotherapy drugs 5-fluorouracil and capecitabine. Variations in UPB1 could alter the decomposition of these drugs, potentially influencing their effectiveness and toxicity in cancer treatment.
