PROX1, a gene involved in critical developmental and physiological processes, might interact non-pharmacokinetically with atenolol, a beta-blocker used for hypertension, particularly influencing its pharmacodynamics related to vascular biology and fluid homeostasis. This potential interaction suggests that varying expression levels of PROX1 could modify the efficacy or necessary dosage of atenolol, although this hypothesis lacks direct empirical support linking PROX1 genetic variations to atenolol's therapeutic response.
