Olanzapine, an antipsychotic known for causing weight gain and altering glucose metabolism, may have an indirect pharmacogenetic relationship with the GIPR gene. Although not directly affecting olanzapine's pharmacokinetics, genetic variations in GIPR could influence how patients experience olanzapineâ€™s metabolic side effects, involving complex pharmacodynamic interactions.
