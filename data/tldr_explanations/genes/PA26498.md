Variations in the CHRNE gene, which encodes the epsilon subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, affect the function of these receptors and influence the efficacy of drugs like pyridostigmine in treating congenital myasthenic syndromes. Pyridostigmine enhances neuromuscular transmission by inhibiting acetylcholine breakdown, increasing its availability at the neuromuscular junction, but changes in CHRNE can alter receptor formation and drug responsiveness, necessitating personalized treatment strategies.
