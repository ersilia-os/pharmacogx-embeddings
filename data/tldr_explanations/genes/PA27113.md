CYP2S1, a cytochrome P450 enzyme, influences the metabolism and efficacy of drugs, especially those administered via inhalation or topically, due to its expression in the liver, lungs, and skin. Although specific drugs affected by CYP2S1 are not well-determined, variations in the CYP2S1 gene can alter how these drugs are metabolized, potentially affecting their efficacy and toxicity.
