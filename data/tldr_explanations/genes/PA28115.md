Thalidomide and lenalidomide, antiangiogenic drugs, interact with the FGF2 gene by modulating its role in promoting angiogenesis, crucial for cancer therapy by inhibiting tumor growth. Conversely, fluvoxamine, an antidepressant, may affect FGF2 potentially through altering growth factor signaling, influencing processes like neuronal growth and plasticity, though this interaction involves more complex mechanisms.
