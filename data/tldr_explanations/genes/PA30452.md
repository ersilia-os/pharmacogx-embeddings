LRP2, or megalin, primarily expressed in renal proximal tubules, significantly affects the handling of vitamin D analogs like calcitriol by facilitating the uptake of the vitamin D binding protein necessary for calcitriol transport. Variations in the LRP2 gene can therefore alter the pharmacokinetics of calcitriol and other drugs dependent on renal excretion, impacting their effectiveness and safety.
