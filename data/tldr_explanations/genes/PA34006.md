The SIRPA gene, involved in immune regulation and cell adhesion, becomes relevant in pharmacogenetics mainly in oncology, where drugs like capecitabine, a prodrug converted to 5-FU in tumors, might influence cancer treatment through indirect interactions. While capecitabine does not directly interact with the SIRPA gene, its role in cancer cell immune evasion via the SIRPA-CD47 pathway may affect how the immune system responds to tumor cells targeted by the drug, suggesting a pharmacodynamic interaction that could impact treatment efficacy.
