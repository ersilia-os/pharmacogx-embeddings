Drugs like decitabine and azacitidine, known for treating hematological malignancies through hypomethylation, might be significant in diseases such as osteosarcoma and lung and colorectal cancers where WIF1 is hypermethylated and silenced. This suggests that restoring WIF1 activity with these drugs could potentially inhibit aberrant WNT signaling in these cancers.
