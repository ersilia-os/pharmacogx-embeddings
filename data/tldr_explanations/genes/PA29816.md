The IL1RN gene encodes the interleukin 1 receptor antagonist, impacting the body's immune response via the IL-1 pathway. Drug interactions with IL1RN include those with anakinra, a synthetic derivative of IL1RN, effectively used in treating inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis by modulating this pathway. While interactions of IL1RN with other drugs like aspirin and methotrexate are speculative and possibly non-pharmacokinetic, they may influence the IL-1 pathway indirectly by altering the inflammatory response.
