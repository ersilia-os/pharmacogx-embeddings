Variants of the NPPA gene affect the pharmacodynamics of antihypertensive drugs such as chlorthalidone and amlodipine. NPPA gene activity can enhance the effects of chlorthalidone by increasing ANP levels, which amplifies its diuretic and antihypertensive actions, and can alter the effectiveness of amlodipine by modulating vascular tone and fluid balance, potentially necessitating dosage adjustments to optimize therapeutic outcomes.
