The gene SLC5A7, responsible for encoding the high-affinity choline transporter 1 (CHT1), is significant in cholinergic neurotransmission and influences the performance of drugs aimed at neurological disorders like Alzheimerâ€™s disease and Myasthenia Gravis. Drugs such as cholinesterase inhibitors, which enhance acetylcholine at synapses, may have varied effects depending on the SLC5A7 variants impacting CHT1 function, while vincristine-related neuropathy may also be influenced by these variations in choline transport and neurotransmitter dynamics.
