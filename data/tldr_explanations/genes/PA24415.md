The ABO gene influences the pharmacodynamics of certain medications such as warfarin and enalapril, affecting therapeutic responses and safety profiles based on an individualâ€™s blood type. For example, individuals with blood type O may require personalized dosing of warfarin due to their naturally lower levels of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII, while the efficacy and safety of enalapril in hypertension management can vary depending on the blood group due to differences in vascular reactivity or inflammatory responses linked to ABO type.
