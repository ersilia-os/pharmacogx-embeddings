RAF1, significantly involved in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, is targeted by kinase inhibitors like sorafenib, which inhibits RAF1 and influences treatment effectiveness or toxicity based on RAF1 gene variants. Other chemotherapy drugs such as docetaxel, carboplatin, paclitaxel, and gemcitabine, while not targeting RAF1 directly, have their effectiveness potentially modulated by RAF1-mediated pathways, impacting their pharmacodynamics in certain cancers.
