EPHA8, primarily involved in neural development, may have a pharmacodynamic interaction with paclitaxel, a cancer treatment drug that stabilizes microtubules and affects cell division. The interaction is suggested to occur because EPHA8 influences cell shape and mobility, impacting the structural dynamics of cells influenced by paclitaxel.
