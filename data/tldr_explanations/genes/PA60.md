ARRB2, involved in the modulation of GPCR signaling, impacts the pharmacodynamics of psychoactive and analgesic drugs like tramadol, methadone, nicotine, buprenorphine, fentanyl, cocaine, and methamphetamine. The gene affects these drugs by mediating GPCR receptor desensitization and internalization once activated, influencing drug efficacy and tolerance, with variability in ARRB2 potentially altering drug responses and side effect profiles.
