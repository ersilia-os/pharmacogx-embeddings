DYNC2H1, known for its role in cilia function and development via dynein motor protein complex involvement, does not exhibit direct pharmacogenetic interactions with common drugs, including etoposide; however, theoretical impacts on cell structural changes caused by etoposide could influence cellular dynamics involving dynein. This proposed interaction between etoposide and DYNC2H1 is speculative and lacks clinical or pharmacogenetic evidence.
