Although there are no directly approved drugs for interacting with MECP2's pharmacogenetics, drugs such as mitoxantrone and fluorouracil, used in cancer treatments, could indirectly affect MECP2 pathways by altering DNA replication and repair or through epigenetic modifications. These interactions may influence the gene's function, particularly in its role in neurological conditions like Rett Syndrome, although the exact mechanism of interaction is not fully defined through pharmacokinetics.
