The NOS3 gene, crucial to cardiovascular disease treatment due to its role in nitric oxide production, interacts with drugs like nitroglycerin, sildenafil, enalapril, atorvastatin, and clopidogrel, affecting their efficacy based on genetic variants such as T-786C. This interaction can alter the pharmacodynamics of these medications, particularly in how they influence vascular tone and endothelial function, resulting in varied effects on blood pressure, angina relief, and endothelial health in patients with different NOS3 genetic backgrounds.
