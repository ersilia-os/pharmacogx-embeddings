APEH, involved in proteolytic processing and highly expressed in the liver and kidneys, may influence the pharmacokinetics of valproic acid, a drug used for epilepsy and bipolar disorder, by affecting the metabolic enzymes responsible for its degradation or modification. This interaction suggests that changes in APEH activity could alter valproic acid's efficacy and plasma concentration by impacting the levels or activity of these enzymes.
