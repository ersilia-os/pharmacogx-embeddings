The KDR gene, which codes for VEGFR-2, is crucial for angiogenesis and influences the pharmacogenetics of various anticancer drugs. Pazopanib directly interacts with KDR affecting drug metabolism and response due to genetic variations, while other drugs like sunitinib, sorafenib, and regorafenib interact at a pharmacodynamic level, influencing their effectiveness in inhibiting angiogenesis based on KDR variants. Meanwhile, drugs such as clopidogrel, carfilzomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone, and fluorouracil may interact with KDR pathways indirectly, affecting tumor responsiveness and drug efficacy through altered angiogenic signaling and endothelial cell behavior.
