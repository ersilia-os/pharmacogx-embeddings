The MOCOS gene is crucial for activating xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase; dysfunction in this gene can alter the metabolism of drugs like azathioprine, which is processed by xanthine oxidase. This altered metabolism can lead to variations in drug effectiveness and toxicity, potentially resulting in either drug accumulation or reduced efficacy due to changes in enzymatic activity caused by MOCOS dysfunction.
