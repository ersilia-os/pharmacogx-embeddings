ASPH, or Aspartate Beta-Hydroxylase, is a gene involved in cell migration, adhesion, proliferation, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition critical to cancer metastasis, making it a target for cancer therapeutics. While specific interactions between ASPH and most drugs are not detailed, there is a suggested, though not documented, non-pharmacokinetic interaction with warfarin potentially affecting its efficacy or safety based on ASPH's role in biological pathways that might influence warfarin's action.
