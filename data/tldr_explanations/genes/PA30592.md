Drugs such as gefitinib and erlotinib, which inhibit EGFR tyrosine kinase, and chemotherapy agents like docetaxel, carboplatin, and paclitaxel may have their efficacy influenced by variations in the MAP3K1 gene due to its role in the MAPK signaling pathway affecting cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Therefore, changes in MAP3K1 could affect how these drugs impact tumor cell survival and proliferation, highlighting the importance of MAP3K1 in pharmacogenetic considerations for cancer treatments.
