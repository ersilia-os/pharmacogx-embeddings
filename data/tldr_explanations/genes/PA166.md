FMO3, a key liver enzyme, affects the pharmacokinetics of various drugs such as nicotine, tacrolimus, sulindac, voriconazole, olanzapine, and teneligliptin by metabolizing them into different degrees of activity based on genetic variations in the enzyme. This variability can significantly alter the drugsâ€™ effectiveness and necessitate dose adjustments to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize side effects.
