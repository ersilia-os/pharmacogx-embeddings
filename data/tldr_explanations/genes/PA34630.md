RORA, implicated in pharmacogenetic interactions, potentially affects the pharmacodynamics of citalopram, a depression medication, by influencing mood regulations and sleep patterns due to its role in depression and circadian rhythms. Additionally, while speculative, RORA's involvement in metabolism and lipid pathways could theoretically interact with the metabolism of statins, though concrete clinical evidence is lacking in this area.
