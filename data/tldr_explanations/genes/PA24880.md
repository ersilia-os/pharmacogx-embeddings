The gene ATG5 is significant in pharmacogenetics, particularly concerning its interaction with drugs like gefitinib, an EGFR inhibitor used in treating non-small cell lung cancers. Although ATG5 does not affect the pharmacokinetics of gefitinib, it potentially influences the drug's pharmacodynamics by moderating autophagy and cell death pathways, which can impact the efficacy and resistance of the drug in cancer therapies.
