The enzyme DHRS7B, involved in the metabolism of steroids and retinoids, could influence the effectiveness and toxicity of statins, which manage cholesterol levels, by altering lipid metabolism pathways. Additionally, it may affect the pharmacodynamics of retinoid drugs—used for treating acne, psoriasis, and certain cancers—by modifying how these drugs are metabolized, potentially impacting their efficacy and side-effect profiles.
