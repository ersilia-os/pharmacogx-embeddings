FNTB gene variations affect the effectiveness of farnesyltransferase inhibitors such as lonafarnib and tipifarnib by altering the structure and activity of the enzyme farnesyltransferase, which is crucial for blocking the activation of cancer-related Ras proteins. While the interactions of FNTB with carboplatin and paclitaxel are less direct, variations in FNTB could hypothetically influence the cellular response to these drugs through pathways indirectly associated with protein farnesylation.
