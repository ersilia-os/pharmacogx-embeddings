The gene ETFRF1 appears to be a typographical error and likely refers to ETFDH, which is involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. The function of ETFDH could influence the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by similar pathways, particularly those affected by mitochondrial dysfunctions or impacting fatty acid metabolism. Drugs like ribofavin, used in treating conditions such as multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) linked to ETFDH mutations, may have pharmacogenetic interactions through effects on ETFDH function or expression, mainly affecting drug metabolism.
