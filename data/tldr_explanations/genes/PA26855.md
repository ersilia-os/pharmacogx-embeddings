Eculizumab, a drug targeting the complement system, may have pharmacogenetic interactions with the CR1 gene because CR1 plays a pivotal role in the immune system's complement cascade. Variations in CR1 could influence the effectiveness or required dosage of eculizumab in treating conditions like paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome through pharmacodynamic mechanisms involving the modulation of complement activity and immune response.
