The gene BCL2L11, which encodes the BIM protein, influences the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs such as ABT-737 and imatinib by affecting apoptosis. ABT-737 works by enabling the release of BIM from BCL-2 complexes, enhancing apoptosis, while the effectiveness of imatinib in causing cancer cell death may be modulated by BIM's involvement in apoptotic pathways, pointing to a pharmacodynamic interaction.
