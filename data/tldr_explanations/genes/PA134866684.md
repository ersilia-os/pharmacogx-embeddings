Paclitaxel, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide, used in cancer treatment, may indirectly interact with the gene EPHA6 by influencing cellular functions related to ephrin signaling pathways, affecting drug sensitivity or neurotoxic effects due to EPHA6's role in neuronal development. These pharmacodynamic interactions, influenced by genetic variability in EPHA6, could alter the effectiveness and toxicity of these drugs, especially in treating cancers involving neural tissues.
