Montelukast and zafirlukast, which are leukotriene receptor antagonists, target the CYSLTR2 gene by preventing leukotrienes from binding to the receptor, thereby reducing symptoms of asthma such as bronchoconstriction and inflammation. Aspirin may also interact with CYSLTR2 indirectly, possibly through modulation of inflammatory pathways, although it does not affect the pharmacokinetics or dynamics directly related to CYSLTR2.
