Variants in the ORMDL3 gene, which regulates sphingolipid biosynthesis, can alter the efficacy of the asthma corticosteroid fluticasone propionate by modifying ceramide levels, impacting cellular responses to inflammation and stress. This genetic variation influences the pharmacodynamics of fluticasone propionate, affecting how effectively the drug works on target sites within the body, rather than altering the drug's pharmacokinetics.
