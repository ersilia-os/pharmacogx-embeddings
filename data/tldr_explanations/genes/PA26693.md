The COCH gene, responsible for cochlin protein in the inner ear and crucial for hearing, may interact with vincristine, a drug used to treat leukemia and lymphoma. It is hypothesized that those with COCH mutations could be more susceptible to vincristine's ototoxic effects, potentially due to a pharmacodynamic mechanism exacerbating pre-existing cochlear vulnerabilities, although explicit pathways linking COCH directly to vincristine's ototoxic effects remain unspecified.
