The PRKAG2 gene, associated with energy balance and cardiac function, does not have direct pharmacogenetic interactions with specific drugs but influences the management of related cardiac conditions like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias. Drugs such as beta-blockers and antiarrhythmics are used to manage these symptoms based on clinical manifestations rather than direct gene-drug interactions, while hydrochlorothiazide is used for managing comorbid hypertension, not due to direct gene-drug interactions.
