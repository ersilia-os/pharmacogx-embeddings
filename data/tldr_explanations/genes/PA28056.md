Mizolastine and desloratadine, used in managing allergic conditions, work by blocking histamine receptors and indirectly affecting the signaling pathways of the FCER1A gene, which is important in allergic response initiation. Though these drugs do not alter FCER1A directly, their effectiveness is influenced by variations in the expression and function of FCER1A, impacting the management of symptoms like inflammation and bronchoconstriction in conditions such as asthma and atopic dermatitis.
