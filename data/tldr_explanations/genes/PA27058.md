Plerixafor, a CXCR4 antagonist, directly blocks CXCR4's interaction with CXCL12, which is pivotal for mobilizing hematopoietic stem cells in the treatment of hematological cancers and for disrupting the signaling pathway in WHIM syndrome, thereby influencing cell homing and immune responses. Understanding genetic variations in CXCR4 can help predict individual responses to Plerixafor, promoting personalized treatment approaches that optimize efficacy and reduce adverse effects in these medical scenarios.
