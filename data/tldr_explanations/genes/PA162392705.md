KAT2B, which plays a role in gene expression regulation via chromatin remodeling, could conceivably interact with HDAC inhibitors that also affect chromatin state, potentially altering KAT2B's activities or substrate availability. Additionally, interactions with drugs like amphetamine and cocaine, by influencing the same acetylation processes that KAT2B controls in the brain, suggest that changes in pharmacodynamics could lead to varied drug effects or responses related to neurological pathways.
