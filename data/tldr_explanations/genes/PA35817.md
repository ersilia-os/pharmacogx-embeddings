SLC16A5, while not directly established in current pharmacogenetic research, is implicated in potentially interacting with drugs through its role in transporting metabolic substances like lactic acid and pyruvate. This suggests that drugs influencing metabolic pathways, such as those involved in glycolysis or gluconeogenesis, could have altered pharmacokinetics due to changes in substrate availability or metabolic byproduct clearance caused by variations in SLC16A5 activity.
