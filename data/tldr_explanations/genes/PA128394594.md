Variants in the KLRK1 gene, which encodes the NKG2D receptor vital in immune system surveillance, can alter interactions with its ligands, thus potentially affecting the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies, particularly those using monoclonal antibodies targeting NKG2D ligands. Although ribavirin mainly treats viral infections, its immunomodulatory effects might indirectly influence KLRK1 pathways by impacting natural killer (NK) cell activities, which are crucial in both cancer therapies and viral-induced tumorigenesis.
