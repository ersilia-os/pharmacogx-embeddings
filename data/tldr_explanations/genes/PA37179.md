UGT1A4 catalyzes the glucuronidation of drugs such as lamotrigine, atorvastatin, valproic acid, methotrexate, testosterone, tamoxifen, anastrozole, olanzapine, and n-desmethylclozapine, affecting their solubility, detoxification, and excretion. Genetic variations in UGT1A4 can significantly alter the metabolism of these drugs, including lamotrigine and hormonal treatments like testosterone and tamoxifen, impacting their therapeutic effectiveness and risk of toxicity, which is crucial for managing conditions ranging from epilepsy and cholesterol to hormone-sensitive disorders and psychiatric conditions.
