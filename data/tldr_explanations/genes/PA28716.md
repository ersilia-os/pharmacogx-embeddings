The GLDC gene is crucial in managing Non-Ketotic Hyperglycinemia (NKH) by influencing the effectiveness of sodium benzoate, which reduces glycine levels in patients by forming hippurate. While the SSRIs citalopram and escitalopram do not interact directly with GLDC, variations in the gene might hypothetically affect the therapeutic outcomes of these drugs in NKH patients with neurotransmitter imbalances, a speculative interaction that suggests a broader impact of GLDC on metabolic and neurological processes.
