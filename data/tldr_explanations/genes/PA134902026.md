The gene SORCS2, implicated in neuronal development and linked to neurological and psychiatric disorders, may interact pharmacogenetically with the drug atazanavir through its influence on neuronal receptor trafficking and processing. This interaction could potentially affect atazanavir's metabolism or transport, thereby altering its efficacy and safety in individuals with genetic variations in SORCS2, although the precise mechanisms are yet to be elucidated.
