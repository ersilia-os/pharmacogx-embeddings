XRCC5, a gene important in DNA repair, influences interactions with drugs like cisplatin, carboplatin, etoposide, and ionizing radiation treatments, which induce DNA breaks, and thus affects cancer treatment outcomes and toxicity based on its variants. Thalidomide might also interact with XRCC5, potentially influencing DNA repair processes indirectly due to its role in cellular responses to DNA damage.
