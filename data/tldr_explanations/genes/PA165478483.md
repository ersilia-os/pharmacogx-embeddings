The gene HYKK, involved in amino acid metabolism, may indirectly affect the pharmacodynamics of varenicline, cocaine, and nicotine. These interactions are speculative and based on the theory that HYKK's metabolic role might impact neurotransmitter-related biochemical pathways, which are influenced by these substances, although explicit evidence of direct interactions is lacking.
