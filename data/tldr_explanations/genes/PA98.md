The activity of the CDA gene, which encodes for the enzyme cytidine deaminase, is crucial in the metabolism of some chemotherapeutic drugs, particularly nucleoside analogs like cytarabine and gemcitabine. Genetic variations in CDA can lead to different enzyme activities that affect drug concentration and active metabolite levels, thereby impacting both the efficacy and toxicity of these drugs; for example, reduced enzyme activity can increase drug plasma levels, heightening the risk of myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity.
