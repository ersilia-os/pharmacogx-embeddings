The gene FBXL19, by influencing cytokine signaling and degradation pathways such as those involving IL-17, potentially affects the pharmacodynamics of biologics like anti-IL-17 antibodies used in treating inflammatory conditions. Variations in FBXL19 could lead to differences in how effectively these drugs manage diseases such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis by altering cytokine degradation rates or signaling, impacting the overall drug efficacy based on individual genetic makeup.
