CD3EAP's role in regulating transcription and replication may influence the effect of chemotherapeutic drugs such as docetaxel, melphalan, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin, which disrupt DNA synthesis and cell division. Although detailed pharmacogenetic interactions have not been extensively documented, the gene's involvement in gene expression and cell cycle progression suggests it could potentially affect the efficacy or toxicity of these drugs in cancer treatment.
