CYP2D6 enzyme is crucial in metabolizing drugs, including codeine, antidepressants like paroxetine and fluoxetine, the antipsychotic risperidone, tamoxifen, and beta-blockers such as metoprolol and timolol, with genetic variations influencing their plasma levels and effects. Differences in CYP2D6 activity can lead to different therapeutic outcomes, with poor metabolizers experiencing potential toxicity and ultrarapid metabolizers having reduced drug efficacy, making pharmacogenetic knowledge essential for adjusting dosages or choosing alternative therapies to optimize treatment efficacy and safety.
