The antipsychotic drug iloperidone, used for schizophrenia, may interact with the gene CELF4, which impacts neuronal excitability and synapse formation. This interaction potentially modifies iloperidone's efficacy and safety by influencing neuronal signaling pathways affected by both the drug and the gene, thus affecting its therapeutic and side effects in neuropsychiatric conditions.
