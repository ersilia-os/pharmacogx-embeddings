Currently, there are no well-documented pharmacogenetic interactions involving direct drug responses with the gene ADGRV1, which is associated with Usher syndrome type 2C and influences auditory and visual functions. Potential therapeutic approaches under consideration include gene therapy to address genetic mutations in ADGRV1 and the development of pharmacological agents targeting pathways affected by ADGRV1 dysfunction, aiming to restore or preserve sensory functions.
