The gene SYNE3, related to the nuclear envelope and cell structure, does not have well-established direct interactions with drugs according to pharmacogenetic research. However, its role in maintaining cellular integrity might indirectly affect how cells respond to drugs like irinotecan, a cancer therapy agent, potentially influencing the drug's efficacy or toxicity due to its impact on cellular architecture and response to DNA damage.
