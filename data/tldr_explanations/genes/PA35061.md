The gene HLA-DOB, which regulates antigen presentation, may affect the efficacy and safety of immune-modulating drugs used in conditions like multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis by altering T cell activity. While the exact pharmacogenetic interactions are not well-defined, it is plausible that different HLA-DOB variants could lead to varied treatment outcomes in diseases requiring modulation of the immune system.
