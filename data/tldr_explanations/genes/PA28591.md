Variants in the GBA gene affect the metabolism and response to enzyme replacement therapies like imiglucerase, velaglucerase alfa, and taliglucerase alfa, used in treating Gaucher's disease by supplementing deficient enzyme activity. Additionally, the effectiveness and tolerability of substrate reduction therapy with eliglustat, which reduces the synthesis of glucocerebroside, can also be influenced by these genetic variations in the GBA gene.
