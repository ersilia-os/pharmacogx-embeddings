Cobimetinib and Trametinib, kinase inhibitors used in melanoma treatment, function by inhibiting signaling components downstream of MAPK1 in the ERK/MAPK pathway, thereby countering excessive cell division due to overactivated MAPK1. Glyburide, a drug for type 2 diabetes, might interact with MAPK1 through its extensive role in cellular signaling, potentially influencing the drug's efficacy or safety; however, this interaction is not well-documented and remains theoretical.
