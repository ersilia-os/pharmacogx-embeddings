In the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), the Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha (RARA) gene interacts with drugs like all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide. ATRA activates the RARA within the PML-RARA fusion protein characteristic of APL, causing leukemic cell differentiation and apoptosis, while arsenic trioxide works by degrading the PML-RARA fusion protein, enhancing the overall treatment efficacy through a synergistic mechanism with ATRA. Genetic variations in RARA may affect the efficacy and toxicity of these treatments.
