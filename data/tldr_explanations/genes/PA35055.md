The HLA-A gene is crucial in pharmacogenetic interactions due to its role in immune-mediated hypersensitivity reactions to certain drugs. For instance, the HLA-A*31:01 allele increases the risk of severe skin reactions to carbamazepine, while the HLA-A*02:01 allele is linked to severe adverse reactions to allopurinol, both through mechanisms involving the immune system's response to these drugs or their metabolites. Other drugs such as abacavir, phenytoin, and flucloxacillin among others are also implicated in similar immune responses based on the HLA-A gene variations, affecting drug pharmacodynamics rather than pharmacokinetics.
