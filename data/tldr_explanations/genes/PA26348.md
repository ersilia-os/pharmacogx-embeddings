Carboplatin and gemcitabine, used in cancer chemotherapy, have a speculative pharmacogenetic link with the gene CDSN, which is primarily associated with skin integrity. This potential link is inferred from the drugsâ€™ dermatological toxicities, like skin rashes, and the effects might relate to CDSN-linked genetic susceptibilities exacerbating skin conditions, characterized more by pharmacodynamic interactions affecting skin health rather than pharmacokinetic processes.
