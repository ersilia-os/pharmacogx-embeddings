Genetic variations in the gene SLC30A8, which influences insulin synthesis and secretion by encoding ZnT-8, a zinc transporter in pancreatic beta cells, can modify the effectiveness of certain anti-diabetic medications like sulfonylureas and repaglinide. These drugs operate by stimulating insulin release, and polymorphisms in SLC30A8 primarily affect their pharmacodynamics and the efficacy with which they stimulate insulin secretion, constituting a pharmacodynamic interaction.
