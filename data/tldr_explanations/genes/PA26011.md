Ethosuximide, an antiepileptic drug used to treat absence seizures, targets T-type calcium channels and may interact with the CACNA1I gene, which is a component of these channels. This interaction could influence the drug's effectiveness or side effects, particularly in neurological conditions where CACNA1I expression or functionality varies.
