Variations in the MAOB gene affect the interactions with MAOB inhibitors like selegiline and rasagiline, which are used in Parkinson's disease treatment to increase brain dopamine by inhibiting the MAOB enzyme, thereby helping manage symptoms. Additionally, the drug risperidone, used in psychiatric disorders, may interact non-pharmacokinetically with MAOB, possibly through changes in neurotransmitter levels affecting its pharmacodynamic properties.
