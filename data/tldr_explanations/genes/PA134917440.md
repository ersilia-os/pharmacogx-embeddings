The gene EPM2AIP1, related to glycogen metabolism, has been linked to the effectiveness and interactions of chemotherapy drugs procarbazine, dacarbazine, and irinotecan. Although EPM2AIP1 does not directly interact pharmacokinetically with these drugs, it may impact their effectiveness through the regulation of cellular metabolism and stress pathways, which is significant in cancers sensitive to metabolic changes.
