The TPMT gene, through genetic variations like TPMT*2, TPMT*3A, and TPMT*3C, plays a significant role in influencing the metabolism of thiopurine drugs including azathioprine, mercaptopurine, and thioguanine. These variations can lead to reduced enzyme activity, thereby increasing the risk of severe myelosuppression if standard doses are used; consequently, dose adjustments based on individual TPMT activity are essential to prevent toxicity and optimize treatment efficacy.
