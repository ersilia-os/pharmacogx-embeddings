Variations in the CHRNB4 gene, which encodes the beta 4 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, influence individual responses to nicotine and smoking cessation therapies like nicotine replacement therapies (NRT). These genetic differences can affect both the binding efficiency of nicotine, altering addiction and treatment outcomes, and interactions with cotinine, potentially influencing its plasma levels and the overall effectiveness and duration of nicotine exposure.
