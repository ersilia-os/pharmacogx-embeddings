Drugs involved in treating metabolic disorders like hyperlipidemia, obesity, and diabetes, as well as sleep disorders, may have altered efficacy or toxicity due to their indirect interactions with the NR1D1 gene, which regulates key metabolic and circadian rhythm pathways. This represents a pharmacodynamic mechanism, where NR1D1's role can affect drug responses by influencing metabolic and inflammatory pathways.
