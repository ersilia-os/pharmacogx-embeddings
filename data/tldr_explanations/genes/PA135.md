CYP27A1, a gene involved in cholesterol and bile acid metabolism, indirectly affects the pharmacogenetics of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) treatment. Mutations in this gene can influence the effectiveness and dosing of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), used to treat CTX by normalizing bile acid levels, and could also interact with other bile acids like cholic acid, suggesting that genetic variations may impact patient responses to these bile acid therapies.
