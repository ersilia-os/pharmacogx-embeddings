PLEKHH2, primarily expressed in kidneys and hearts, may interact pharmacodynamically with cardiovascular drugs like verapamil and atenolol due to its role in cardiac signaling pathways. These interactions could influence the effects of these drugs on heart rate and contractility, although the exact mechanisms of how PLEKHH2 affects drug response are not yet fully understood.
