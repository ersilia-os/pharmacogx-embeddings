FCGR3A gene polymorphisms, particularly the V158F variant, significantly impact the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies like rituximab, trastuzumab, and cetuximab in cancer treatments by affecting the protein's affinity for IgG and thus influencing the effectiveness of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Patients with the high-affinity V allele of this gene typically show enhanced responses to these treatments due to more potent ADCC, emphasizing the importance of FCGR3A genotyping in personalized cancer therapy.
