FZD3, involved in the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway, may influence the effectiveness of drugs like paclitaxel, which is used in cancer treatment and acts by stabilizing microtubules and inhibiting cell division. Although there are no direct pharmacokinetic interactions between FZD3 and paclitaxel, the interaction is likely pharmacodynamic, potentially affecting drug behavior in cancers where Wnt signaling is altered.
