Nortriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, may have an indirect pharmacodynamic interaction with UST (uronyl-2-sulfotransferase) gene activity, as UST influences connective tissue health. Genetic variations in UST, affecting dermatan sulfate synthesis, might change the clinical response to nortriptyline in disorders like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome by altering disease symptoms rather than direct drug metabolism, potentially necessitating adjustments in drug dosage or monitoring.
