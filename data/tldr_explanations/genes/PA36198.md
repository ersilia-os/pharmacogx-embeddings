The gene STK11, which encodes the tumor suppressor LKB1, significantly affects the efficacy of the drug metformin in cancer treatment by altering its pharmacodynamic profile through the LKB1-AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway. Metformin's effectiveness as an anticancer agent, primarily used to manage diabetes, may be influenced by mutations in STK11 which potentially impact the drug's ability to activate AMPK, thereby modulating its tumor suppressive effects.
