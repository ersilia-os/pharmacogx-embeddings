Variants in PROS1, a gene encoding for protein S which acts as an anticoagulant cofactor, can significantly influence the effectiveness and safety of Vitamin K antagonists like warfarin by affecting protein availability or function, thereby suggesting a need for warfarin dosage adjustments. Additionally, although not explicitly demonstrated, PROS1 may potentially interact with thrombopoietin receptor agonists such as lusutrombopag and avatrombopag, potentially necessitating different treatment approaches for patients, given its role in the clotting cascade, impacting the drugs' pharmacodynamics.
