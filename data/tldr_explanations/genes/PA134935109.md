Variations in the IL23R gene, which encodes the Interleukin 23 Receptor, affect the efficacy of drugs targeting the IL-23/IL-17 pathway such as ustekinumab, guselkumab, and risankizumab, used in treating autoimmune diseases like psoriasis and Crohn's disease. Specifically, certain IL23R polymorphisms may improve the response to treatments like ustekinumab in psoriasis, suggesting that a patient's IL23R genotype can influence the outcome of biological therapies that modulate this pathway.
