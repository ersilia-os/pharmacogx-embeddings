SLC16A1, or monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), impacts the efficacy and toxicity of drugs used in cancer therapy and in treating metabolic disorders by influencing the transport of lactate and ketone bodies, thereby affecting metabolic pathways these drugs target. Variations in the SLC16A1 gene can affect the pharmacokinetics or dynamics of drugs that inhibit glycolysis in cancer treatment or those affecting glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis treatment, making genetic understanding of lactate transport efficiency vital for optimizing these therapies.
