The ZNF804A gene, mainly associated with mental health disorders, is speculated to interact with heroin not through direct pharmacokinetics but by potentially influencing neural pathways and circuits, thereby modifying the brain's response to this drug. This interaction is considered indirect and arises from the gene's regulatory effects on neural processes and psychiatric pathophysiology.
