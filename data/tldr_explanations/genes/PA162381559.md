The CCDC148 gene, which encodes a protein with coiled-coil domains, has speculative interactions with the aromatase inhibitors letrozole and exemestane, used in breast cancer treatment. These potential interactions, thought to possibly affect drug efficacy or metabolism through protein-protein interactions, lack solid evidence and are not currently considered in clinical decision-making regarding these drugs.
