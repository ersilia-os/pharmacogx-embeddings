The SLC15A1 gene, encoding PEPT1, plays a vital role in the absorption and bioavailability of various drugs, including Î²-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillins and cephalosporins), the antiviral drug Oseltamivir, and ACE inhibitors, due to its function in transporting drugs that resemble dipeptides or tripeptides. Genetic variations in SLC15A1 can affect the pharmacokinetics of these drugs, leading to different therapeutic outcomes and necessitating dosage adjustments in personalized medicine.
