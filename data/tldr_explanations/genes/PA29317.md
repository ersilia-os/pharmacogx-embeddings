The HMBS gene's interactions with certain drugs can exacerbate symptoms in patients with Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP) because drugs like barbiturates, sulfonamide antibiotics, and anticonvulsants induce hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, thereby increasing heme synthesis demands, depleting HMBS activity, and causing toxic metabolite accumulation. Treatment for AIP involves avoiding these drugs or using them cautiously, and employing therapy with hemin and glucose to inhibit further heme synthesis and alleviate symptoms.
