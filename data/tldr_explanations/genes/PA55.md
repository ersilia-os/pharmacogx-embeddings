The APOE gene variants significantly impact the efficacy and safety profiles of medications used in treating Alzheimer’s disease and lipid metabolism disorders. For instance, in Alzheimer’s treatment, drugs like donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine may have varied effects in APOE ε4 allele carriers, altering cognitive enhancement outcomes. Similarly, statins such as atorvastatin and simvastatin, crucial for cholesterol management, demonstrate different responses based on APOE genotypes, mainly due to variations in lipid processing and transport. Even anticoagulants like warfarin and acenocoumarol have interactions with APOE variants, influencing their effectiveness and necessitating personalized dosing for optimal results.
