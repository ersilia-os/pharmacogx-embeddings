EIF3A, a component of the translation initiation factor complex, influences the efficacy of the chemotherapy drug carboplatin by affecting protein synthesis related to drug response or resistance. Although EIF3A's interaction with methadone is noted, the pathway of this interaction remains unclear and potentially unrelated to its known roles in protein synthesis and cancer therapy.
