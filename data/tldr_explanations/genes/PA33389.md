While the gene PLCD3 is involved in vital calcium signaling and homeostasis by catalyzing the hydrolysis of PIP2 to DAG and IP3, its interaction with drugs like diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, is not well-documented. However, it is hypothesized that variations in PLCD3 could influence the pharmacodynamics of diltiazem, affecting its efficacy and safety in individuals with different expression levels or mutations of this gene.
