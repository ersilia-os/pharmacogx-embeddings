Leflunomide and teriflunomide pharmacogenetically target and inhibit DHODH, an enzyme crucial for pyrimidine synthesis, reducing nucleotide production needed for DNA and RNA synthesis and thereby limiting the proliferation of rapidly dividing cells like activated lymphocytes. This interaction, primarily pharmacodynamic, impacts the efficacy and safety of these drugs in treating autoimmune diseases, with genetic variations in DHODH influencing individual drug responses.
