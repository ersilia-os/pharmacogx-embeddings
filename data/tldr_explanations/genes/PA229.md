Variations in the LEPR gene, which regulates appetite and energy balance through leptin signaling, can affect the efficacy of medications like leptin therapy used for obesity-related conditions. Other drugs such as atorvastatin, simvastatin, valproic acid, and clozapine, although not directly targeting metabolic issues, can interact with the LEPR gene in a way that influences their effects on metabolic states and weight gain, impacting both drug effectiveness and side effects through pharmacodynamic mechanisms.
