The gene XDH interacts pharmacogenetically with several drugs by influencing their pharmacokinetics; allopurinol and febuxostat, which target XDH directly to manage gout by reducing uric acid production, are affected by genetic variations in XDH that can alter drug effectiveness and tolerability, necessitating potential adjustments in treatment. Additionally, XDH activity affects the therapeutic effects and side effects of azathioprine, mercaptopurine, thioguanine, and didanosine, as these drugs also interact with xanthine oxidase during their metabolic processes, highlighting the importance of considering genetic variations in XDH when optimizing treatment plans for enhanced safety and efficacy.
