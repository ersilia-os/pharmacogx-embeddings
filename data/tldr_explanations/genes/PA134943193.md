The ARID5B gene, essential in transcriptional regulation, interacts with methotrexate in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) by altering its metabolism due to genomic polymorphisms, affecting the drug's effectiveness and toxicity. Variants in ARID5B are linked to an increased relapse risk in ALL because they change how the drug is metabolized and handled by the body, with a suggested but not well-defined interaction with imatinib, potentially through mechanisms involving chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation.
