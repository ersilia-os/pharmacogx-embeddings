B4GALT2, involved in glycosylation, might interact with the metabolism and efficacy of drugs like clopidogrel and aspirin, although its impact would be indirect as these drugs do not rely on glycosylation for their primary mechanisms of action. Clopidogrel is activated by CYP450 enzymes, and aspirin works through COX-1 inhibition; therefore, any influence B4GALT2 has would pertain to secondary cellular interactions or signaling processes after the drugs have acted, rather than directly affecting their activation or metabolism.
