The gene CMTM8, involved in cellular signaling and potentially acting as a tumor suppressor, is speculated to have a pharmacodynamic interaction with the drug methylphenidate, commonly used for ADHD. This interaction, which could potentially modify drug response or side effects, is suggested due to CMTM8â€™s role in neurotransmitter systems that intersect with methylphenidate's mechanism of action in elevating brain dopamine and norepinephrine levels, though this remains largely unconfirmed by empirical data.
