The gene ALDH9A1, involved in metabolizing aldehydes such as those from ethanol, may affect the metabolism of drugs that form aldehydes or increase aldehyde levels, potentially including those inducing oxidative stress. Additionally, its role in processing neuroactive substances suggests that ALDH9A1 could influence the effects of drugs interacting with neurotransmitter systems, especially those related to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
