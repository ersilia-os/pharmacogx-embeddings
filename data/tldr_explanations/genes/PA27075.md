Drugs such as doxorubicin, vincristine, idarubicin, simvastatin, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide may interact with the CYBA gene, which influences the immune response and regulates oxidative stress. These pharmacodynamic interactions can affect the efficacy and toxicity of the drugs based on how CYBA variants modulate oxidative stress and immune responses, impacting treatments like chemotherapy, immunosuppression, and cardiovascular disease management.
