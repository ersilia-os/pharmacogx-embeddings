The gene SH2B1 interacts with drugs commonly used in psychiatric treatments such as mirtazapine, paliperidone, quetiapine, valproic acid, aripiprazole, risperidone, olanzapine, amisulpride, and clozapine, influencing their metabolic side effects like weight gain and altered glucose metabolism through pharmacodynamic mechanisms involving leptin and insulin signaling pathways. This interaction emphasizes the importance of considering SH2B1's role in managing these side effects to enhance personalized psychiatric care focused on metabolic health.
