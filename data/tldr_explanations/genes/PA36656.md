TNRC6A plays a crucial role in the microRNA-induced silencing complex, affecting the effectiveness of miRNA mimetics and inhibitors by influencing gene expression control. Variations in TNRC6A could potentially change how these drugs function, impacting their efficacy in treatments that rely on regulating miRNA, particularly in diseases like cancer.
