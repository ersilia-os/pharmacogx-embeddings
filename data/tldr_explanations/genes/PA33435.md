The PMCH gene, which affects appetite, mood, and sleep by regulating energy homeostasis and behavioral processes, interacts pharmacologically with drugs like olanzapine. Olanzapine, an antipsychotic that can cause weight gain, may exacerbate obesity and metabolic syndrome by enhancing the effects or expression of MCH, leading to increased appetite. Additionally, targeting the MCH receptor with antagonists presents a therapeutic approach to manage obesity and metabolic disorders by potentially mitigating the adverse effects associated with PMCH expression or activity.
