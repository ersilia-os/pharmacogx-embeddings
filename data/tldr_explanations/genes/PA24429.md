ACSS2, a key enzyme in converting acetate to acetyl-CoA, influences the efficacy and metabolism of anticancer drugs like docetaxel, carboplatin, gemcitabine, and paclitaxel, by affecting lipid synthesis and cellular energy dynamics, which in turn impacts drug solubility and distribution for lipophilic drugs, and the cellular metabolic environment for drugs. These interactions are predominantly pharmacodynamic, relating to the metabolic state's effect on drug efficacy rather than direct pharmacokinetic processes.
