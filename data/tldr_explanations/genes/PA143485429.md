The CCDC77 gene, known for potentially maintaining cell structural integrity and orchestrating protein complexes, has no established pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs such as capecitabine, a prodrug metabolically converted to the anti-cancer agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Although lacking direct evidence linking CCDC77 to the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of capecitabine, it is speculated that CCDC77 could indirectly influence the drugâ€™s cellular effects, potentially affecting its efficacy or toxicity.
