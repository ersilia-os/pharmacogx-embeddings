IL18 interacts pharmacokinetically with tacrolimus, potentially affecting the drugâ€™s metabolism or transport via its regulatory role on immune cells, while it may influence the pharmacodynamics of ribavirin by enhancing interferon-gamma production and thus potentially boosting the drug's antiviral efficacy. Genetic variations in IL18 can impact patient responses to these drugs, highlighting the necessity of considering genetic profiles in treatment plans.
