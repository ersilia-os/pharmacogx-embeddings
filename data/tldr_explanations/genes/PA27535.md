DUX1, a gene involved in transcription regulation, has suggested non-pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs such as isoniazid, rifampin, and caffeine, possibly through modifications in genetic expression that indirectly affect the metabolism of these drugs. The interaction between DUX1 and these drugs is inferred from the geneâ€™s regulatory roles, rather than direct evidence, suggesting a need for further research to confirm and clarify these effects.
