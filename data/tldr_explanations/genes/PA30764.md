Variations in the METAP1 gene, which is crucial for the initial processing and maturation of proteins, might affect the metabolism and effectiveness of peptide-based drugs and those that depend heavily on liver and kidney processing, such as insulin. This impact arises because METAP1 plays a significant role in removing the N-terminal methionine from nascent proteins, which is essential for their proper function and interactions, potentially altering the pharmacodynamics and safety profiles of these medications.
