Variations in the ALOX5AP gene can alter the levels of leukotrienes it produces, impacting the effectiveness of leukotriene receptor antagonists like montelukast and zafirlukast, used for treating asthma and allergic rhinitis. Additionally, ALOX5AP might influence the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine, a relationship that is not yet well understood and deviates from the gene's known functions in leukotriene biosynthesis.
