The FMO5 gene, unlike its family members, has a unique role in pharmacogenetics, particularly due to its broad substrate specificity and presence in the liver and small intestine. It indirectly influences drug metabolism, such as with metformin, by potentially altering the metabolic environment or modifying intermediate biomolecules, thus affecting the drug's efficacy and safety through non-traditional pathways related to its handling of metabolic byproducts connected to sulfur and nitrogen.
