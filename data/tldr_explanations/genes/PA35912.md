The gene SLC6A6, responsible for encoding the taurine transporter, affects the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of drugs that modify cellular hydration and membrane properties, such as diuretics and treatments for diabetes. These interactions occur because taurine influences osmoregulation and membrane stabilization, which are crucial for the action of these drugs.
