MUCL3, a mucin-like protein, is suggested to potentially influence the chemotherapeutic effectiveness of drugs like carboplatin and gemcitabine by affecting cellular signaling and mucus properties; this interaction is non-pharmacokinetic, indicating that MUCL3 may alter how cancer cells respond to these drugs rather than affecting their metabolism or clearance. This hypothesis is based on mucins' roles in cellular barriers and signaling, which could modulate the drug responses or resistance mechanisms at a cellular level.
