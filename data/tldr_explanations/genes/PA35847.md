SLC22A18AS has not been directly linked to specific pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs, but it indirectly influences drug processes due to its impact on the expression of SLC22A18, a gene involved in cellular drug transport. Despite this influence, there are no detailed reports of direct drug interactions, and its role might affect drug efficacy and toxicity in cancer treatment by modifying the tumor microenvironment.
