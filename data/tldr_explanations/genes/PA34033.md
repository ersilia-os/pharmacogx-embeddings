Drugs that modulate the cell cycle, specifically affecting separase activity or altering gene expression related to cell cycle checkpoints, may interact with the PTTG1 gene. As PTTG1 influences tumor aggressiveness and therapy responsiveness through its role in cell cycle regulation and mitotic checkpoints, particularly in cancers where it is overexpressed, these drugs could be crucial in targeted cancer therapies aimed at inhibiting or promoting PTTG1 activity to control tumor growth.
