The OR10P1 gene, an olfactory receptor, does not directly interact with drugs like beta-blockers (metoprolol and atenolol) in influencing drug metabolism or response. However, genetic variations in such olfactory receptors might indirectly affect sensory perceptions that could influence psychological or behavioral responses to these medications, especially in patients with coexisting conditions like anxiety or stress disorders. This suggests a broader, physiological interconnectedness rather than a direct pharmacogenetic interaction.
