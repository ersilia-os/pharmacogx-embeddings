The TH gene, critical for synthesizing catecholamines like dopamine, significantly affects the efficacy of neurological drugs such as L-DOPA, dopamine agonists, and MAOIs used in treating conditions like Parkinson's disease. While L-DOPA directly utilizes dopamine synthesis pathways, dopamine agonists and MAOIs impact dopamine levels and, by extension, might influence TH function and expression, affecting drug efficacy and clinical outcomes.
