Drugs such as pegbelfermin, which is a PEGylated FGF21 analog, target pathways involving FGF21 and FGF19 and rely on KLB as a co-receptor. Variations in the KLB gene can affect how these drugs interact with their pathways, potentially influencing their efficacy and the clinical outcomes in treating metabolic disorders like NAFLD, obesity, and type 2 diabetes.
