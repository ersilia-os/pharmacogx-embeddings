THRA, or Thyroid Hormone Receptor Alpha, is crucial in determining the efficacy of thyroid hormone therapies like levothyroxine, especially in hypothyroid patients with specific gene variants who may require adjusted dosages for optimal effect. Although its interaction with other drugs such as aspirin is mentioned, the exact impact of THRA on medications beyond thyroid therapies remains unclear and is not well-defined in the literature.
