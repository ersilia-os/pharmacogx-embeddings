The chemotherapy drugs fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide indirectly influence the activity of TP53AIP1, a gene involved in tumor suppression and apoptosis, through their effects on the p53 signaling pathway. Fluorouracil induces DNA damage leading to p53-mediated apoptosis, epirubicin generates free radicals causing both p53-dependent and independent apoptosis, and cyclophosphamide cross-links DNA, activating p53 and potentially increasing TP53AIP1 expression, thereby impacting cancer treatment efficacy and drug resistance.
