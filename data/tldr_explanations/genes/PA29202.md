Hydroxyurea and voxelotor are drugs used in treating hemoglobinopathies like sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia, influenced by variations in the HBB gene. Hydroxyurea works by increasing fetal hemoglobin production to reduce sickle hemoglobin polymerization and its complications, while voxelotor directly increases hemoglobin's oxygen affinity, with their effectiveness varying based on HBB gene mutations. This variation is attributed to pharmacodynamic factors—how the drug interacts with hemoglobin affected by different gene variants—rather than pharmacokinetic processes.
