The KNG1 gene affects the pharmacokinetics of ACE inhibitors used for hypertension by modifying levels of bradykinin, a peptide involved in the kallikrein-kinin system. This interaction can increase the risk of angioedema due to elevated bradykinin levels when ACE inhibitors inhibit its breakdown, showcasing a pharmacodynamic interaction crucial for personalized medicine and therapy optimization.
