Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) targets the ODC1 gene by acting as a suicide inhibitor of the ODC1 enzyme, essential in polyamine biosynthesis, thereby effectively reducing polyamine levels necessary for tumor cell proliferation in cancers like neuroblastoma and colorectal cancer. The effectiveness of DFMO and its interaction with drugs such as aspirin, which may influence or be influenced by ODC1 activity, points to the importance of accounting for genetic variations within the ODC1 gene to optimize cancer treatment outcomes.
