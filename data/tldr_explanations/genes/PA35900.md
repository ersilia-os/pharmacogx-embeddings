Variations in the SLC4A8 gene, which encodes a sodium bicarbonate cotransporter involved in pH and ion balance, could potentially affect the effectiveness or toxicity of drugs that modulate electrolyte transport or pH levels. This includes drugs used in treating epilepsy, certain diuretics affecting renal bicarbonate handling, and possibly anesthetics that alter cellular metabolism, based on the gene's function in acid-base homeostasis and neuronal activity, despite the lack of direct evidence of specific drug interactions.
