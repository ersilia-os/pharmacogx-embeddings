The ABCB5 gene encodes a protein that leads to drug resistance in cancer therapy by actively expelling chemotherapy drugs like doxorubicin, vincristine, and paclitaxel from cancer cells, thereby reducing drug efficacy at the target site. Although interaction with haloperidol, an antipsychotic medication, is noted, it possibly affects ABCB5 differently, by modifying its expression level rather than through direct pharmacokinetic mechanisms.
