Variations in the PCSK1 gene, which plays a critical role in hormone processing, could theoretically impact the effectiveness of drugs such as synthetic insulin, sulfonylureas, and GLP-1 agonists used in diabetes management. These variations might affect both the bioavailability and activity of these drugs by altering the efficiency of endoproteolytic processing of hormones like insulin and glucagon.
