FMO1 plays a crucial role in the metabolism of the antipsychotic drug olanzapine, where its activity, influenced by genetic variations, affects the drug's concentration and thereby its efficacy and safety. The gene's interaction with nicotine, however, is less direct and might influence nicotine-related pathways rather than metabolizing nicotine itself.
