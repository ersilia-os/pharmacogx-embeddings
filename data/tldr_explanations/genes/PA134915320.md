The gene ARHGAP28, which regulates Rho GTPases affecting cellular processes like actin cytoskeleton organization, may interact with the drug pegaspargase, used in treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Although the direct pharmacogenetic link is not fully established, the interaction is thought to be pharmacodynamic, impacting the drug's efficacy through changes in cellular responses related to processes such as cell motility and migration, which are critical for the drug's action on lymphoblast survival.
