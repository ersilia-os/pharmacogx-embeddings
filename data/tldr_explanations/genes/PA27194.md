There are no well-documented direct pharmacogenetic interactions between DDO, which catabolizes D-amino acids like D-aspartate and D-glutamate, and specific drugs, but its role in neuromodulation and hormone regulation suggests potential interactions with drugs targeting neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. These interactions, primarily pharmacodynamic, involve the influence of DDO on the neuromodulator levels rather than on drug metabolism or clearance.
