GATM, involved in creatine biosynthesis, potentially influences the metabolism and therapeutic efficiency of drugs like rosuvastatin and simvastatin, which are known for their cholesterol-lowering effects and may affect muscle energy metabolism. This interaction could be critical, especially in conditions like Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency, where creatine levels are inherently low, potentially aggravating muscle-related side effects of these statins.
