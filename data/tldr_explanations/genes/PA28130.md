FGFR4 plays a significant role in cancer treatment, influencing the effectiveness of certain drugs by affecting signaling pathways related to cell proliferation and survival. Drugs like everolimus, which interacts with the mTOR pathway, as well as fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate, which target DNA replication and cell division, may have variable efficacy based on FGFR4 interactions that alter the tumor microenvironment and cellular sensitivity.
