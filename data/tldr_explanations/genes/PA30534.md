MAF, a gene involved in transcription regulation and immune system modulation, indirectly affects drug effectsâ€”particularly in cancer therapies like those using methotrexate. In diseases such as multiple myeloma, MAF overexpression or mutation may alter methotrexate's effectiveness or toxicity by modulating cellular differentiation and response to oxidative stress, impacting the drug's pharmacodynamic interaction with affected cells.
