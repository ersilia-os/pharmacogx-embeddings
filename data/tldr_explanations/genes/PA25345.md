The gene BGLAP, primarily known for its role in bone mineralization, interacts with dexamethasone—a corticosteroid impacting bone metabolism—indirectly by affecting bone density and calcium homeostasis. This interaction is pharmacodynamic rather than pharmacokinetic, potentially altering the effectiveness of osteoporosis treatments by modifying the biological systems involving BGLAP, especially in prolonged steroidal therapy.
