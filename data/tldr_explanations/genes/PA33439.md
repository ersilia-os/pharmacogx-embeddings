All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide, used in treating acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), interact with the PML-RARA fusion protein involved in APL; ATRA promotes differentiation of leukemic cells by degrading this protein, while arsenic trioxide induces apoptosis through similar degradation. Their effectiveness relies on the pathway involving the PML-RARA fusion, influencing disease pathology directly rather than altering drug metabolism or distribution.
