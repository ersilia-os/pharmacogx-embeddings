ARNT indirectly influences the metabolism of drugs like atorvastatin and clopidogrel by regulating cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP3A4 for atorvastatin and CYP2C19 for clopidogrel), though specific interactions have not been conclusively documented. Variations in ARNT activity could hypothetically alter the metabolism rates of these drugs, impacting their effectiveness and safety profiles.
