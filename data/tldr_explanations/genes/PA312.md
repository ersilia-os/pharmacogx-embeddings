Key drugs such as fluoxetine, sertraline, and other SSRIs interact pharmacogenetically with the SLC6A4 gene, notably influenced by the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism, which modulates their efficacy and side effects. This interaction also extends to other serotonergic drugs like clomipramine and non-SSRIs such as mirtazapine, where SLC6A4 genetic variations can affect drug pharmacokinetics or dynamics, thereby impacting clinical outcomes.
