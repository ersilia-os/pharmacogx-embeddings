The PDZRN3 gene is implicated in protein ubiquitination and may impact the pharmacodynamics of drugs like irinotecan, a cancer therapy drug, by potentially influencing the degradation of proteins relevant to the drug's action or metabolism. Although PDZRN3's specific drug interactions remain largely unexplored, its role suggests more influence on the dynamics of drug action rather than the pharmacokinetics such as absorption or excretion.
