Drugs like clopidogrel and nifedipine, which are primarily eliminated or metabolized via renal pathways, could have their pharmacokinetics affected by alterations in the function of SLC14A2, a gene encoding the urea transporter B critical for renal urea transport. While there is no direct connection established between SLC14A2 and these drugs, changes in SLC14A2 activity could indirectly impact renal function, thus potentially affecting the efficacy and safety profiles of these medications.
