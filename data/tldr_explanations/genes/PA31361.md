The L265P mutation in the MYD88 gene enhances the efficacy of BTK inhibitors like ibrutinib and zanubrutinib in treating malignancies such as Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, by altering signaling pathways that impact drug dynamics and tumor interaction with the immune system. In contrast, the role of MYD88 in affecting the pharmacokinetics or dynamics of anesthetic and pain management drugs like fentanyl and desflurane is less clear, potentially involving indirect immunomodulatory effects or inflammation pathways, but lacks direct evidence.
