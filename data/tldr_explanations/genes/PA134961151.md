NSUN3, a mitochondrial methyltransferase, methylates cytosine 34 in mitochondrial tRNA-Met, impacting cellular energy regulation and mitochondrial protein synthesis. Although no concrete pharmacogenetic interactions between NSUN3 and specific drugs are known, there might be a theoretical pharmacodynamic interaction with capecitabine, a prodrug metabolized into 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Variations in NSUN3 could potentially affect the metabolism of capecitabine, altering its efficacy and toxicity by impacting mitochondrial health and metabolic capacity.
