The CYP3A7 enzyme, important in fetal liver metabolism, interacts with drugs like atorvastatin and tacrolimus by potentially altering their pharmacokinetic profiles and systemic exposure during fetal development due to its activity in metabolizing these CYP3A substrates. Additionally, corticosteroids such as betamethasone and cortisone acetate may also interact with CYP3A7, affecting their metabolic rates and therapeutic outcomes in neonates and infants, though the specific pathway (pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic) of these interactions is less defined.
