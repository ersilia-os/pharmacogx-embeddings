SLC28A2 plays a crucial role in the transport of nucleoside and nucleoside analog drugs into cells, impacting their absorption, efficacy, and side effects. Variants of the SLC28A2 gene can alter the pharmacokinetics and effectiveness of drugs like ribavirin, gemcitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, mercaptopurine, and methotrexate, leading to significant variations in therapeutic outcomes and toxicity profiles.
