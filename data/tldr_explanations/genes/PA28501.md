Variations in the GABRG2 gene, which encodes for a subunit of GABA-A receptors, significantly influence the pharmacodynamic response to benzodiazepines, affecting drug efficacy and side effects. These mutations modify how these drugs enhance GABAergic neurotransmission, crucial for their therapeutic outcomes in treating conditions like epilepsy and anxiety.
