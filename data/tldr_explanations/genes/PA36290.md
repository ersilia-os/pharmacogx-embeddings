The gene SYT1, involved in neurotransmitter release, may indirectly affect the response to drugs like cocaine, which inhibits neurotransmitter reuptake and could interact with synaptic processes involving SYT1. Although direct evidence is limited, it is suggested that changes in SYT1 function could alter the effects of cocaine by affecting the synaptic availability of neurotransmitters like dopamine.
