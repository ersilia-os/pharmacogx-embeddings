GAD1 plays a role in converting glutamate to GABA and variations in its function can impact responses to drugs like heroin and methadone, which interact with CNS neurotransmitter systems. Variations in GAD1-related GABA synthesis can affect the effectiveness and side effects of these drugs, particularly in conditions like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and epilepsy where GABAergic neurotransmission is crucial.
