ABCA1 interacts with lipid-modifying drugs such as statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin) by influencing their pharmacodynamics through modulation of cellular cholesterol uptake and removal, critical to statin efficacy. Furthermore, ABCA1 impacts the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel by altering its absorption and metabolism, potentially affecting the drug's plasma levels, efficacy, and safety, with these interactions varying based on genetic variants of ABCA1.
