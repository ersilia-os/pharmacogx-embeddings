The CHURC1 gene, involved in cellular differentiation and organogenesis, may potentially intersect with the pharmacodynamics of methylphenidate, a drug used to treat ADHD that affects neuronal signaling and neurotransmitter release. While there isn't concrete evidence linking CHURC1 with pharmacogenetic interactions for methylphenidate, the gene's role in similar biological pathways suggests it could influence drug responses.
