NBEA, although not directly interacting pharmacogenetically with specific drugs, may influence the response to medications like metformin used in treating neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD, potentially through its role in synaptic transmission and plasticity. This interaction likely involves non-pharmacokinetic pathways, such as the modulation of synaptic functionalities, instead of traditional pharmacokinetic interactions.
