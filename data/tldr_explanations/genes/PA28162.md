FKBP5 plays a crucial role in modulating the pharmacodynamics of drugs affecting the central nervous system and immune response by influencing glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity. This gene's interactions notably affect drugs like dexamethasone, SSRIs (such as escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, citalopram), venlafaxine, mirtazapine, nefazodone, bupropion, and clozapine, necessitating personalized medicine approaches that consider FKBP5 genetic variations due to altered drug efficacy and side effect profiles.
