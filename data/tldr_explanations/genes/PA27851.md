ERCC5, critical in the nucleotide excision repair pathway, influences the effectiveness and side effects of platinum-based chemotherapeutics like cisplatin and carboplatin by impacting DNA repair mechanisms in cancer cells; variations in its function may alter drug responses, enhancing tumor sensitivity or providing cytotoxic protection in normal cells. Additionally, although mainly hypothetical, ERCC5 might also affect how cells respond to imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, through potential connections to DNA repair pathways, suggesting a pharmacodynamic rather than pharmacokinetic interaction.
