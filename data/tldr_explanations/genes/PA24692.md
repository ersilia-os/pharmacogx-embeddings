ALDH1A1, through its enzyme activity, influences the efficacy and toxicity of various chemotherapeutic drugs by metabolizing them into less toxic compounds. Cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide, both alkylating agents, may have reduced efficacy in tumor cells rich in ALDH1A1 due to its ability to confer resistance by protecting cancer cells from the drugs' cytotoxic effects.
