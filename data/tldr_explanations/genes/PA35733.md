While SH3BP2 has no direct well-documented pharmacogenetic interactions with specific drugs, its roles in immune cell signaling and bone metabolism suggest potential impacts on the efficacy and safety of immune modulators and bisphosphonates. These hypothetical interactions, inferred from the gene's functions in pathways targeted by these drugs, would likely influence drug effects (pharmacodynamics) rather than the processing of drugs within the body (pharmacokinetics).
