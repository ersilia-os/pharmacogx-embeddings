The gene CRTC2, involved in regulating glucose and energy homeostasis, may have indirect interactions with the drugs glucose and tacrolimus. Glucose can alter metabolic states affecting CRTC2 activity and thereby influence energy and glucose production, while tacrolimus might impact metabolic regulation and insulin sensitivity by affecting pathways involving CRTC2, suggesting complex pharmacodynamic interactions rather than direct pharmacokinetic effects.
