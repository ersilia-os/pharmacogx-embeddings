Although the gene RUNDC3B is primarily involved in intracellular trafficking, its potential pharmacogenetic interaction with imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in cancer treatment, remains speculative. Given RUNDC3B's role in cellular dynamics, there is a possibility that it could influence the intracellular concentration and efficacy of imatinib in cancer cells, particularly those with varying expressions of RUNDC3B; however, this interaction lacks concrete evidence and is still under exploration.
