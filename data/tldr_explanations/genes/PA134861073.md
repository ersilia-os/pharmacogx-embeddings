The gene MISP, important in cell division regulation, may interact with chemotherapy drugs such as paclitaxel, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide, which target cell division processes. Paclitaxel inhibits mitosis by stabilizing microtubules, potentially affecting MISP's role in spindle orientation, while epirubicin and cyclophosphamide interfere with DNA processes and could interact with MISP's cell cycle roles, potentially impacting the effectiveness or toxicity of these treatments.
