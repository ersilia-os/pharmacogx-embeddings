SULT2B1, known for steroid metabolism, may interact with cancer drugs cytarabine, idarubicin, and fludarabine through potential pharmacodynamic interactions or alternative pathways, rather than direct pharmacokinetics. The interaction likely stems from SULT2B1's impact on steroid hormone pathways, which can influence the proliferation of hormone-sensitive cancer cells, thus potentially modifying the effectiveness or toxicity of these chemotherapeutic agents.
