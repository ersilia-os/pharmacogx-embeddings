Variations in the SLC29A3 gene, which is responsible for nucleoside transport, can affect the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine, a nucleoside analog used in cancer treatment, by altering its cellular uptake. This gene-drug interaction may influence gemcitabine's efficacy and toxicity by adjusting the drug levels inside cells, impacting therapeutic outcomes and side effect profiles.
