NEDD4, as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, impacts the efficacy of diuretics by influencing epithelial sodium channels (ENaC), thus affecting sodium reabsorption and blood pressure regulation. Additionally, it is hypothesized that NEDD4 may impact the anticoagulant effects of warfarin through its role in cellular signaling pathways, although specific studies are needed to confirm this interaction.
