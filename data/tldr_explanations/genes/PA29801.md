The IL17RA gene, essential for the inflammatory response, interacts with immunomodulatory drugs such as secukinumab and ixekizumab, which treat autoimmune diseases like psoriasis by inhibiting IL-17A and hence affecting IL17RA function. This alteration in IL17RA could impact the drugs' efficacy, varying with individual genetic differences. Aspirin, although not directly affecting IL17RA, might influence overall inflammatory pathways that interact with IL17RA, suggesting a broader, nonspecific pharmacodynamic interaction.
