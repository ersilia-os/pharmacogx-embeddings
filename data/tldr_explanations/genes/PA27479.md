Variants in the DRD3 gene, which encodes the dopamine receptor D3, influence the effectiveness and side effects of drugs like risperidone and olanzapine in treating schizophrenia, particularly due to polymorphisms like Ser9Gly affecting susceptibility to side effects such as tardive dyskinesia. Furthermore, DRD3 interactions also play a significant role in how drugs such as aripiprazole, clozapine, duloxetine, and paroxetine function, largely because of their impact on dopamine neurotransmission, which affects both the efficacy and side effects of these drugs.
