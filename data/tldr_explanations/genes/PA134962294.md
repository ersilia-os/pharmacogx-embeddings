The IKBKE gene influences the pharmacodynamics of drugs like gefitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor for non-small cell lung cancer, due to its role in NF-ÎºB and type I interferon pathways. Variation in IKBKE may affect gefitinib's efficacy or resistance by altering cancer cell proliferation and survival pathways, exemplifying how genetic differences can modify drug response.
