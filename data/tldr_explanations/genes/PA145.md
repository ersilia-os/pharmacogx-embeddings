Variants in the DPYD gene, which encodes the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, can impair the metabolism of fluoropyrimidine drugs such as 5-fluorouracil and capecitabine, leading to their toxic accumulation and severe side effects like neutropenia and neurotoxicity. Although the interaction with 5-fluorouracil is direct, other drugs like docetaxel and oxaliplatin may be impacted indirectly, possibly due to combined therapy effects or synergistic toxicities.
