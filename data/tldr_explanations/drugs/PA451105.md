Primidoneâ€™s effectiveness and safety are influenced by genetic variations in enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are pivotal in converting primidone into its active metabolite, phenobarbital, impacting the drug's levels and patient response. Variations in these genes can either increase the risk of side effects due to higher drug exposure or lead to insufficient therapeutic effects by hastening the drug's metabolism. Other enzymes like CYP2E1, CYP3A4, and UGTs also play roles in its metabolism and elimination, while interactions with the TRPM3 channel affect neuronal excitability, though the genetic implications on this are less clear.
