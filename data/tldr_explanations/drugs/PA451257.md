Risperidone metabolism is heavily influenced by the CYP2D6 gene, with variants affecting drug plasma levels and, consequently, its efficacy and side effects. Other genes such as CYP3A4 and ABCB1 also affect its metabolism and transport, while the pharmacodynamics involve interactions with neuroreceptors like DRD2 and HTR2A, which can impact therapeutic outcomes based on genetic variations affecting receptor expression or function.
