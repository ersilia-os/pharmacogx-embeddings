Codeine's efficacy and safety are influenced by genetic variants primarily in CYP2D6, which metabolizes codeine into morphine, its active form, with variants leading to different metabolizing efficiencies and impacting therapeutic outcomes. Other genes like ABCB1, UGT2B7, OPRM1, and SLC22A1 also play roles in codeine's absorption, distribution, clearance, and pharmacodynamic interaction by encoding proteins that affect the drug's overall bioavailability and response.
