Perindopril, an ACE inhibitor, has pharmacogenetic interactions primarily influenced by the ACE gene that affects its ability to inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, altering its antihypertensive effects. Further, the BCHE gene modifies how perindopril is metabolized into its active form, perindoprilat, affecting its efficacy and safety, while transporter genes SLC15A1 and SLC15A2, along with the BDKRB1 gene in the bradykinin pathway, adjust the drug's pharmacokinetics and vasodilatory effects. Genes like G6PD and AGTR1 also play secondary roles in impacting the cardiovascular response to perindopril through mechanisms involving oxidative stress and angiotensin II receptor functionality.
