Variants in the CYP3A4 gene affect the metabolism of vindesine, potentially altering its pharmacokinetics and leading to increased toxicity or reduced efficacy due to variations in drug concentration. Additionally, the ABCB1 transporter, involved in drug efflux, could influence the distribution and elimination of vindesine, thereby affecting its overall efficacy and toxicity profile.
