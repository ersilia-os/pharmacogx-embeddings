Genetic variations in transporter genes ABCB1 and ABCG2 can influence the pharmacokinetics of amisulpride, affecting its plasma concentrations and distribution, while variants in dopamine receptor genes DRD2 and DRD3, as well as serotonin receptor-related genes like HTR2C and HTR1A, could alter how patients respond to the drug in terms of efficacy and side effects. This reveals the importance of considering genetic profiles to optimize the use of amisulpride in treating psychiatric conditions.
