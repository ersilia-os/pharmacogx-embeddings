Ibrutinib's effectiveness and safety are influenced by genetic variants in the CYP450 enzymes (including CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2D6), which affect how the drug is metabolized, thus altering its concentration and the potential risk of side effects. Specific polymorphisms, such as CYP3A5*3, play a crucial role in determining the levels of ibrutinib available for its intended action on the BTK protein. Additionally, genetic differences in proteins like ALB and ORM2 could further modify ibrutinibâ€™s distribution and plasma protein binding, which are key factors in its pharmacologic profile.
