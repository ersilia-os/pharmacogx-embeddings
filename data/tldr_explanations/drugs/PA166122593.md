Sofosbuvir's pharmacogenetics involves its metabolism and transport influenced by genes such as CES1, which is crucial for the hydrolysis and activation of the prodrug, and CTSA that aids in its activation process. Variations in genes like ABCB1 and ABCG2, which are involved in the drug's absorption and distribution, as well as HINT1, which is involved in later stages of drug activation, can affect sofosbuvir's bioavailability, efficacy, and overall therapeutic outcomes.
