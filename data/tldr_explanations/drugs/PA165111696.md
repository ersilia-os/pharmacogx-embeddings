The metabolism of artemisinin is significantly influenced by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, particularly CYP2B6, and to a lesser extent, CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. Variations in CYP2B6 due to genetic polymorphisms can affect the metabolic efficiency of artemisinin, altering drug levels in the plasma and thus impacting both the efficacy and safety of the treatment.
