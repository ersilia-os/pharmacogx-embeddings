Genetic variations in the metabolic enzymes UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 substantially affect the metabolism of Artenimol, impacting drug levels and its effectiveness and safety. The enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 also play a role in Artenimol's metabolism, though their impact is less significant compared to UGT1A9 and UGT2B7; these differences could necessitate varied dosing strategies to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse reactions.
