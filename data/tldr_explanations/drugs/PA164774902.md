Tolazamide's metabolism is significantly influenced by CYP2C9 enzyme polymorphisms, with the alleles CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 leading to reduced enzymatic activity and higher drug levels, increasing hypoglycemia risk. Additionally, variations in the ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes, which affect ATP-sensitive potassium channels on pancreatic beta-cell surfaces, can alter insulin secretion and thus the drug's efficacy in treating Type II diabetes.
