Encorafenib, a BRAF kinase inhibitor used in cancer therapy, is most effective against tumors with the BRAF V600E mutation, a key target of its action. The drug's metabolism is primarily governed by CYP3A4, with minor roles for CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, and its pharmacokinetics can be altered by polymorphisms in these enzymes and transporter proteins such as ABCB1 and ABCG2, affecting drug levels, tissue penetration, and excretion. Moreover, mutations in NRAS, HRAS, and KRAS genes could modify the therapeutic efficacy of encorafenib by influencing downstream signaling pathways.
