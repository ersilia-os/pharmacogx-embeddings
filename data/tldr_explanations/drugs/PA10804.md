Imatinib's effectiveness and side effects in treating chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors are influenced by genetic variations in metabolic enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP3A5), transporters (ABCB1, ABCG2), and absorption/distribution genes (SLC22A1, SLCO1A2). Additionally, mutations in target proteins like BCR-ABL and KIT also affect the drug's efficacy, highlighting the need for genotyping these genes to optimize treatment outcomes and personalize therapy.
