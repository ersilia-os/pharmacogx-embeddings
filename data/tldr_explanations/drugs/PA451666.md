Thioridazine metabolism is primarily influenced by CYP2D6 genetic polymorphisms, which cause variations in drug levels impacting its efficacy and side effect profile. Poor metabolizers have higher plasma concentrations increasing side effect risks, such as cardiac arrhythmias, while ultra-rapid metabolizers may experience subtherapeutic drug levels, reducing effectiveness.
