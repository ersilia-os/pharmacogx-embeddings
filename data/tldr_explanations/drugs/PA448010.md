Acarbose acts by inhibiting enzymes like MGAM, SI, AMY2A, and GAA in the gastrointestinal tract, affecting the pharmacodynamics rather than the pharmacokinetics due to its minimal systemic absorption. Genetic variations in these enzymes or in metabolic regulators like PPARA, which influences lipid and possibly carbohydrate metabolism, could hypothetically affect the drug's effectiveness and side effects, even though specific pharmacogenetic interactions are not well-documented for acarbose.
