Clobazam's metabolism is significantly affected by interactions with the CYP2C19 enzyme, where genetic variants like CYP2C19*2 can lead to reduced enzymatic activity. This reduction increases plasma levels of N-desmethylclobazam, clobazam's active metabolite, thus affecting therapeutic outcomes and potentially increasing the risk of adverse reactions, which impacts dosing requirements and the overall risk-benefit ratio of using the drug. Other enzymes, like POR, and genes like SCN1A, may influence its metabolism or pharmacodynamics, but clear evidence of their impact on clobazam's pharmacogenetics is lacking.
