The metabolism of tenoxicam, an NSAID, is significantly influenced by genetic variations in the CYP2C9 enzyme which it utilizes for liver metabolism; these variations affect how the drug is processed and thus its plasma levels, posing risks of prolonged exposure in individuals with reduced CYP2C9 activity. Additionally, tenoxicam's effectiveness and side effects are also affected through its inhibition of PTGS1 and PTGS2, critical enzymes in prostaglandin synthesis, and by the transporter protein SLC22A8, which influences its renal excretion.
