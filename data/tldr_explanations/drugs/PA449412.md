Key genes like ABCB1, ABCC1, and CYP3A4 impact the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin by modulating its cellular concentration and metabolism, affecting the drug's efficacy and toxicity. Meanwhile, genes such as TOP2A, TOP2B, and variations in SLC28A3 influence its pharmacodynamics and are linked to therapeutic outcomes and side effects such as cardiotoxicity during doxorubicin treatment.
