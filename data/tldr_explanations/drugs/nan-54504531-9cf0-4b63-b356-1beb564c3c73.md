Clofazimine interacts pharmacogenetically with multiple enzymes and transporters that affect its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Key metabolic enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C8, and CYP2D6, influenced by genetic variants like CYP3A4*22 and CYP3A5*3, alter its plasma levels and potentially its efficacy and toxicity, while genetic variations in transporters like ABCB1, ABCG2, and ABCC1 may impact tissue distribution, absorption, and elimination. Additionally, genetic differences in clofazimine's molecular targets, such as PPARG and KCNA3, can modify its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects.
