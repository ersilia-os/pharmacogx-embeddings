Etravirine, a Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor for HIV-1, has pharmacogenetic interactions primarily involving its metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Variants in these genes can affect drug levels and efficacy, with certain alleles potentially leading to increased toxicity or altered effectiveness due to changes in metabolism speed. Additionally, transporter genes like ABCB1 also play a role by influencing the drug's absorption and distribution, impacting its pharmacokinetics.
