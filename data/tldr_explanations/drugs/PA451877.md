Vinblastine's pharmacogenetics are influenced by its metabolism and transport involving CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes and ABCB1 and ABCC1 transporters. Variations in these genes can affect vinblastine's metabolic rate, plasma levels, distribution, and elimination, thereby impacting its therapeutic efficacy and toxicity, such as increasing risks of neutropenia or neurotoxicity.
