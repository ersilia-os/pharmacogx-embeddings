Dapoxetine, an SSRI used for treating premature ejaculation, has pharmacogenetic variability influenced by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes. Variants in CYP2D6 categorize individuals into different metabolizer types—poor, intermediate, extensive, ultrarapid—altering the drug's plasma concentration and effectiveness, with poor metabolizers at risk of severe side effects and ultrarapid metabolizers seeing reduced efficacy. Genetic variations in CYP3A4 further affect dapoxetine's pharmacokinetics, indicating the importance of pharmacogenetic testing for personalized medication dosing to optimize efficacy and safety.
