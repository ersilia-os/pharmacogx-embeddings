Cariprazine's pharmacogenetics involves crucial interactions with the **CYP3A4** and **CYP2D6** genes which are key in its metabolism, affecting the drug's plasma levels and requiring potential dosage adjustments based on individual genetic variations. Further, genes like **DRD2**, **DRD3**, and various serotonin and adrenaline receptor genes (**HTR1A**, **HTR2A**, **HTR2B**, **HTR2C**, **HRH1**, and **ADRA1A**) influence its pharmacodynamics, where genetic variations might impact the drug's effectiveness in treating schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
