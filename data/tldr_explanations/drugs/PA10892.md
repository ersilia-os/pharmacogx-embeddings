Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 can significantly affect the metabolism of Gliclazide, potentially necessitating dose adjustments due to altered drug plasma levels and risk of hypoglycemia. Additionally, ABCC8 gene variants may influence the efficacy of Gliclazide by affecting insulin secretion from pancreas cells, and changes in other genes such as VEGFA may contribute to its cardiovascular effects.
