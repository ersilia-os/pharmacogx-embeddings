Vemurafenib's effectiveness is significantly influenced by the BRAF V600E mutation, which determines the drug's ability to target and inhibit the mutated BRAF kinase critical to the MAPK signaling pathway. Additionally, its pharmacokinetics are affected by CYP3A4, which metabolizes the drug, and its pharmacodynamics can be influenced by genetic variants in genes like NRAS, HRAS, and KRAS that activate alternative pathways, potentially conferring resistance and affecting the overall therapeutic outcome of vemurafenib.
