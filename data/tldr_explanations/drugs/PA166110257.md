The metabolism of dexlansoprazole is greatly affected by the CYP2C19 gene, where genetic variants of this gene categorize individuals as extensive, intermediate, or poor metabolizers, influencing the drug's pharmacokinetics. This variation affects dexlansoprazole's efficacy and side effects; poor metabolizers may experience increased drug exposure and side effects, while extensive metabolizers might have reduced drug efficacy due to lower drug levels.
