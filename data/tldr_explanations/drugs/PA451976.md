Zolpidem's metabolism is largely governed by the cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, whose genetic variants can alter drug levels and influence both the efficacy and safety of the drug, by affecting its plasma levels and clearance. Additionally, while zolpidem acts pharmacodynamically by enhancing the inhibitory action of GABA via GABA_A receptor subunits, the specific impacts of genetic variants on this mechanism are not well-delineated.
