Ezetimibe's efficacy and safety are influenced by its metabolism and transport, with key genes including UGT1A1, UGT2B15, NPC1L1, SLCO1B1, and ABCB1 playing pivotal roles. Polymorphisms in these genes affect the drug's metabolism rate, plasma levels, and interaction with cellular targets, thereby impacting its lipid-lowering effectiveness.
