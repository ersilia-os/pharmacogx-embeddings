Topiramate's pharmacogenetic interactions are influenced by its metabolism through CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 enzymes, with genetic variants in these enzymes affecting its plasma levels and efficacy, necessitating possible dose adjustments. Additionally, genetic variations in pharmacodynamic targets such as SCN1A, GABRA1, CA12, GRIK1, and UGT2B7 can impact its antiepileptic effectiveness and overall pharmacological profile by affecting key receptors and metabolic pathways.
