Genetic variations in the MTHFR gene, such as the C677T and A1298C polymorphisms, significantly influence the enzymatic conversion of folic acid to its active form, methyltetrahydrofolate, affecting homocysteine levels and cardiovascular disease risk. Other genes like ABCB1, SLC19A1, MTR, MTRR, and several related to downstream pathways of folic acid metabolism, impact its transport, cellular uptake, and overall supplementation efficacy, with potential implications for conditions like megaloblastic anemia.
