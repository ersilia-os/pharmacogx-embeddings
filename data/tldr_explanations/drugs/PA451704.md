Variants in the gene MT-RNR1 impact mitochondrial susceptibility to the ototoxic effects of aminoglycosides like tobramycin, potentially leading to hearing loss. Additionally, resistance to tobramycin may be influenced by genes that encode aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes or by mutations in ribosomal RNA, affecting the drug's efficacy by enabling bacterial resistance mechanisms.
