Genetic variations in the enzymes CYP2C8, CYP3A4, and UGT1A1 significantly influence the metabolism of dasabuvir, a drug used to treat hepatitis C, potentially affecting the drugâ€™s levels, efficacy, and side effects. Additionally, genetic variants in transport proteins ABCG2, ABCB1, and ABCB5, as well as in the IFNL3 gene, which impacts immune response, can also modify how dasabuvir is distributed, eliminated, and how it interacts with the host's antiviral response, respectively.
