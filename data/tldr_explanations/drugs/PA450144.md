Ketamine's pharmacogenetic interactions involve its metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP2B6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9, which affect its clearance and action due to individual genetic variations. These variations influence ketamine's efficacy and safety, creating differences in therapeutic effects and side effects among individuals. Additionally, genetic polymorphisms in receptor genes like GRIN2B and BDNF may alter ketamine's pharmacodynamics, affecting its effectiveness as an anesthetic and its antidepressant properties.
