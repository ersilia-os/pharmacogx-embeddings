Ceftriaxone interacts pharmacogenetically with various transporters such as SLC22A6 (OAT1), SLC22A8 (OAT3), and ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), affecting its clearance, plasma concentration, efflux from cells, and tissue distribution, which impacts therapeutic outcomes and side effects. Genetic variants in these transport genes and others like SLC22A11, SLC15A1, SLC15A2, as well as minimal interactions through metabolic pathways involving GLUL and binding variables like ALB, influence the drugâ€™s pharmacokinetics.
