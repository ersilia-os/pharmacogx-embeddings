Lamotrigine's effectiveness and safety are influenced by the interactions of various genes affecting its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Gene variants in UGT1A4 and UGT2B7 modify its metabolic rate, potentially altering drug clearance and increasing toxicity risks, while polymorphisms in ABCB1 affect drug distribution in the brain, impacting efficacy and side effects. Furthermore, variations in SCN1A and SCN2A, which encode sodium channel proteins, may influence lamotrigineâ€™s mechanism in stabilizing neuronal membranes and controlling neuronal firing, crucial for its anticonvulsant effects.
