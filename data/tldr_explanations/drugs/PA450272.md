Genetic variations in the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 influence the metabolic rate of lovastatin, affecting its efficacy and side effects, while variations in the SLCO1B1 transporter, such as the c.521T>C SNP, significantly impact its uptake in the liver and risk of myopathy. Additionally, variations in non-ADME genes like CETP, LDLR, and APOA5 indirectly influence lovastatin's therapeutic outcomes by altering lipid profiles, and variants in HMGCR, the drug's primary target, could modify its effectiveness.
