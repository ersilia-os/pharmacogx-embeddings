Genetic variations in enzymes CYP2C19 and CYP2B6 significantly influence the metabolism of methylphenobarbital into phenobarbital, affecting the drugâ€™s efficacy and safety due to differing metabolic rates that can lead to underdosing or toxicity. Moreover, genetic variations in GABA_A receptor subunits may cause pharmacodynamic variability, although the specific polymorphisms and their impacts are not thoroughly documented.
