Sirolimus pharmacogenetics is heavily influenced by the genes CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, which control the drug's metabolism, and variations in these genes necessitate dosage adjustments to prevent toxicity and achieve therapeutic effects. Additionally, the ABCB1 gene affects the drug's absorption and distribution, while genes such as POR and NR1I2 further influence sirolimus by modifying the activity of enzymes and drug transporters involved in its handling, with non-CYP genes like IL10, PPARA, and TCF7L2 impacting its effects through immune and metabolic pathways.
