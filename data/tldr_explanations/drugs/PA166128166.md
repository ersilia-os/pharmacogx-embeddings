Ledipasvir, an antiviral drug treating Hepatitis C, primarily interacts with genes ABCB1 and ABCG2, which are involved in drug transport and can significantly influence the drug's absorption and distribution in the body. Variations in these genes, as well as in IFNL3 and IFNL4 that affect immune response, can alter the effectiveness or safety of ledipasvir, potentially requiring dose adjustments or close monitoring.
