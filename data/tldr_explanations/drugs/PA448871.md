Celecoxib metabolism primarily depends on the CYP2C9 enzyme and its genetic variants, such as CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3, which reduce metabolic activity and can increase the drugâ€™s plasma concentrations, affecting its safety profile. Other genes including CYP2C8, ABCB1, and ABCC4 also influence celecoxib's pharmacokinetics, while genes such as ALOX12 and PTGS2 may affect its pharmacodynamic responses in inflammation-related pathways.
