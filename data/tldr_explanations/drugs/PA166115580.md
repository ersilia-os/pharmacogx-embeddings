Tafenoquine's effectiveness and safety are influenced by interactions with CYP2D6 and G6PD genes. CYP2D6 is responsible for the metabolic activation of tafenoquine, with variations such as poor metabolizer status leading to reduced drug efficacy. Conversely, G6PD helps to mitigate the oxidative stress caused by tafenoquine; deficiencies in G6PD can increase the risk of hemolysis, affecting the drugâ€™s pharmacodynamics and potentially its pharmacokinetics by altering red blood cell turnover.
