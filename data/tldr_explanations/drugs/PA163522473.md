The pharmacogenetic profile of Tipranavir is influenced by its interactions with metabolic enzymes, such as CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, as well as transporters including ABCB1, which affect the drug's metabolism and cellular efflux, respectively. Variants in these genes can lead to significant alterations in Tipranavir's plasma concentrations, impacting drug efficacy and potential for adverse effects.
