Ephedrine interacts pharmacogenetically by acting as an agonist at ADRA1A, ADRB1, and ADRB2 receptors, with genetic variants in these receptors potentially affecting the drug's efficacy and side effects such as respiratory and cardiovascular responses. Additionally, variations in the SLC6A2 gene, encoding a noradrenaline transporter, influence ephedrine's ability to elevate synaptic noradrenaline levels, impacting its sympathomimetic effects, while genetic variants in the BCHE and ACHE enzymes may affect drug metabolism and the duration of ephedrine's action.
