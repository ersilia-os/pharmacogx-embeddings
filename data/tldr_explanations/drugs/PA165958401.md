Cabazitaxel metabolism is primarily mediated by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes, with genetic polymorphisms in these enzymes impacting the drug's plasma levels, effectiveness, and toxicity. Additionally, genetic variations in ABCB1 and ABCG2, which are involved in drug transport, can affect cabazitaxelâ€™s distribution and efficacy.
