Cannabidiol (CBD) metabolism is primarily influenced by CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 enzymes, where genetic variants in these enzymes can alter its plasma levels, efficacy, and safety. Additionally, genetic variations in ABCC5 and SLC15A1 transporters, as well as the AOC1 enzyme, may impact CBD's distribution, excretion, and pharmacodynamics, thus affecting its therapeutic outcomes.
