Atazanavir's pharmacokinetic profile is influenced by its interaction with various genes related to its metabolism and transport, such as CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, which are crucial for its metabolism, and UGT1A1, whose polymorphisms can lead to adverse reactions like hyperbilirubinemia by affecting bilirubin processing. Other notable genes include NR1I2, which influences the transcription of metabolism enzymes; ABCB1, affecting absorption through P-glycoprotein; and ABCC2 and SLCO1B1, which play roles in the drug's distribution and excretion.
