The pharmacogenetic profile of phenylalanine is largely determined by its interactions with the PAH gene, responsible for encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase, which is essential for converting phenylalanine into tyrosine. Deficiencies in this enzyme activity, due to genetic variations in PAH, can lead to phenylketonuria (PKU), affecting the severity of the condition and the effectiveness of dietary treatments designed to limit phenylalanine intake. Other genes like SLC7A8 and SLC16A10, involved in the amino acid's transport, along with enzymes such as TAT and TH that participate in downstream tyrosine metabolism, may also influence phenylalanine's pharmacogenetics and its effects on disorders like depression and vitiligo.
