Binimetinib, a drug that inhibits MEK1 and MEK2, is metabolized through glucuronidation by UGT1A1 and oxidative pathways involving CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, with genetic variations in these genes affecting drug processing, efficacy, and toxicity. Furthermore, the efficacy of binimetinib in treating conditions like melanoma and NSCLC is contingent on BRAF gene mutations (specifically V600E or V600K), making pharmacogenetic testing for these mutations critical for patient selection and predicting treatment response.
