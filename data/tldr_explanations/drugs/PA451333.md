Genetic variations in the enzymes CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, as well as the transporter ABCB1, significantly affect the metabolism, efficacy, and safety of sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Specifically, variants in CYP2C19, like rs4244285 and rs4986893, result in poor metabolism, leading to higher plasma levels of the drug and potentially increasing the risk of adverse effects, which highlights the importance of genotyping these variations for optimizing treatment plans.
