Genetic variations in the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes significantly impact the metabolism of lidocaine, affecting its plasma concentration and duration of action; individuals with reduced enzyme activity may experience higher plasma levels and increased risk of toxicity. Additionally, lidocaine's effectiveness and safety are influenced by its interaction with sodium channels such as SCN10A, SCN9A, SCN5A, and SCN4A, which it blocks to achieve its anesthetic and antiarrhythmic effects.
