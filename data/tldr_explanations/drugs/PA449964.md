The pharmacogenetics of ifosfamide are significantly influenced by variations in genes encoding CYP450 enzymes like CYP2B6 and CYP3A4, which control its metabolism into active metabolites that bind to DNA and produce cytotoxic effects. Additionally, polymorphisms in the ALDH1A1 gene affect the detoxification of these metabolites, impacting the drug's toxicity profile, while variations in genes like ERCC2 and KLC3 could influence the effectiveness and adverse effects of the treatment by modulating DNA repair and cellular transport.
