Amikacin interacts with the MT-RNR1 gene, which encodes mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA similar to bacterial ribosomal RNA, increasing susceptibility to ototoxicity due to cellular damage in the cochlea. Additionally, genetic variations affecting renal function can influence amikacin-induced nephrotoxicity by impacting drug accumulation, due to its primary excretion via the kidneys, which may present varying toxicity risk profiles in patients with such genetic predispositions.
