Dihydrostreptomycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, exhibits ototoxicity primarily due to pharmacogenetic interactions involving the MT-RNR1 gene, which affects mitochondrial function crucial for energy production in the cochlea. These interactions are pharmacodynamic, focusing on how the drug influences cellular processes and leads to adverse effects rather than affecting drug metabolism and elimination.
