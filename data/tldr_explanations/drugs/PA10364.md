The genes NR1I2 and BCHE are significant in understanding the pharmacogenetics of memantine: NR1I2 affects the drug's metabolism and excretion by regulating various enzymes and transporters, while BCHE's role, though not directly involved in memantine's primary metabolism as an NMDA receptor antagonist, could indirectly alter treatment outcomes in Alzheimer's disease due to its involvement in cholinergic mechanisms.
