Genetic variations in CYP2A6 and CYP3A4 can significantly influence the metabolism of letrozole, impacting its efficacy and toxicity, while variations in UGT2B7 and ABCB1 might affect the drug's clearance and absorption, respectively. Additionally, polymorphisms in CYP19A1, the target of letrozole, may alter drug binding and efficacy, underlining the importance of considering these genetic factors in optimizing letrozole therapy for individual patients.
