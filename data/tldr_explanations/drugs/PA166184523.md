Alpelisib targets the PIK3CA gene, where mutations enhance cancer cell growth by activating the PI3K pathway, making the drug particularly effective in cancers with these mutations. The drug is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4, with involvement from CYP2C9, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19, and polymorphisms in these enzymes can affect drug efficacy and toxicity. Additionally, alpelisib is an efflux substrate for transporters like ABCG2 and ABCB1, where genetic variants can influence drug efflux and impact its effectiveness and adverse effects.
