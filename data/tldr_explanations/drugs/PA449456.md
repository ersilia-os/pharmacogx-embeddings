Enalapril's pharmacogenetics are affected by genetic variations in genes such as CES1, which is crucial for its metabolism into active enalaprilat, and ACE, which influences the drug's efficacy and side effects like angioedema and cough through the alteration of angiotensin and bradykinin pathways. Other genes, including SLCO1B1, NOS3, ABO, VEGFA, and NR3C2, play roles in modulating drug uptake, vascular response, and cardiovascular risk, thereby affecting therapeutic efficacy and the profile of adverse events.
