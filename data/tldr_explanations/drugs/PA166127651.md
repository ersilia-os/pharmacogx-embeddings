N-desmethyltamoxifen, a vital metabolite of tamoxifen, interacts significantly with the CYP2D6 enzyme, which is crucial for its conversion from tamoxifen and influences its effectiveness in breast cancer therapy. Variants in the CYP2D6 gene affect the levels of this metabolite, impacting its therapeutic efficacy or potential side effects, while CYP3A4's role in its metabolism is less definitive.
