Exemestane, a potent aromatase inhibitor used in hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 and acts by irreversibly binding to CYP19A1, an enzyme crucial for estrogen synthesis. Genetic variations in CYP19A1 and CYP3A4 can significantly affect the efficacy and safety of Exemestane, influencing both estrogen levels necessary for its therapeutic action and the drugâ€™s pharmacokinetics, which may necessitate dose adjustments.
