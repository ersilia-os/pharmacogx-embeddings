Variations in the cytochrome P450 enzyme genes, **CYP2C8** and **CYP2C9**, significantly impact the pharmacokinetics of montelukast by altering drug levels in the body, which in turn affects the drugâ€™s efficacy and safety profile. Additionally, montelukast pharmacokinetics can also be influenced by genetic variations in **SLCO2B1**, a gene that affects the drug's absorption and clearance, as well as indirectly by **ALOX5**, which is involved in leukotriene synthesis pathways.
