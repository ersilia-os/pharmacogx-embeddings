Methylphenidate, used for ADHD and narcolepsy, is metabolized by CES1, with genetic variants of CES1 affecting its plasma concentration and efficacy. Additionally, genes such as CYP2D6, SLC6A3 (DAT1), and DRD4 influence the drug's pharmacodynamics by altering neurotransmitter reuptake or receptor sensitivity, ultimately impacting its effectiveness and side effect profile.
