Sumatriptan, a serotonin receptor agonist used for migraines, primarily metabolizes via MAOA and interacts pharmacogenetically with several genes. Notably, the GNB3 gene's rs5443 polymorphism is linked with improved responses in cluster headache patients, suggesting its relevance in personalized medicine, while transporter genes like ABCB1 and ABCG2, and genes such as OPRM1, COMT, DBH, BDNF, HTR2A, and DRD2, affect its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, potentially influencing drug effectiveness and side effects through their roles in neurotransmission and pain pathways.
