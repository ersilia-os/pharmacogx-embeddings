Genetic variants in the KEAP1 gene, influencing the Nrf2 pathway related to oxidative stress, and in the HLA-DRB1 gene, important for immune response, could impact the effectiveness and patient response to dimethyl fumarate due to their roles in the drug’s pharmacodynamic properties. Additionally, gene GSTP1, while implicated in oxidative stress may affect the drug’s pharmacodynamics, though direct clinical evidence is lacking.
