Ticagrelor's metabolism is significantly influenced by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 gene variants, which affect the drug's active concentration in the body, altering its effectiveness and safety. Additionally, variations in the ABCB1 gene, which encodes P-glycoprotein, impact ticagrelor's absorption, excretion, and ultimately its plasma concentrations, thereby affecting both its efficacy and risk profile.
