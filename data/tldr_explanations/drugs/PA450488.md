Mexiletine metabolism is predominantly influenced by the CYP2D6 enzyme, with variations in this gene affecting its plasma levels, potentially leading to adverse effects in poor metabolizers or therapeutic ineffectiveness in ultrarapid metabolizers. The drug targets the sodium channel protein encoded by SCN5A, and variations in this gene might also impact its effectiveness and safety in controlling arrhythmias.
