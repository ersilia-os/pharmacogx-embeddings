Vincristine metabolism is significantly affected by variations in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 genes, influencing its metabolic clearance, and thereby altering drug exposure and risks of toxicity. Additionally, genetic variations in transporters like ABCB1, ABCC1, ABCC2, and ABCC3 can modify vincristine's distribution and elimination, affecting drug resistance and toxicity, while interactions with proteins like TUBB and TUBA4A impact its pharmacodynamics.
