Butorphanol, an opioid analgesic, interacts with the μ-opioid receptor (OPRM1), κ-opioid receptor (OPRK1), and to a lesser extent, the δ-opioid receptor (OPRD1), which dictate its effects and antagonist properties. Variants in these receptor genes (OPRM1, OPRK1, OPRD1) may impact the drug's efficacy and safety, influencing its analgesic potency and the occurrence of adverse effects such as opioid-induced hyperalgesia or reduced effectiveness.
