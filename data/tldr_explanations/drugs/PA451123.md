Genetic variations in CYP2C19 can significantly alter the metabolism of progesterone, affecting its efficacy and safety by influencing drug exposure and side effect risks. Additionally, variants in receptor genes such as PGR, NR3C2, ESR1, and ESR2, and transporter genes like ABCB1 and SLCO1B1, impact progesterone's effectiveness and bioavailability, which are crucial for therapeutic outcomes in reproductive processes.
