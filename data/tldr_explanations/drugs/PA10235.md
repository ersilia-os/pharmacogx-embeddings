Zoledronic acid interacts pharmacogenetically primarily through the inhibition of key enzymes GGPS1 and FDPS in the mevalonate pathway, essential for osteoclast function, and also with the ABCC1 gene, which affects the drug’s distribution and elimination. Genetic variations in these genes can influence the drug’s effectiveness and safety, impacting bone resorption and osteoclast apoptosis, and potentially altering the therapeutic outcomes in treating bone diseases.
