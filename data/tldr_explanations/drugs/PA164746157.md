The pharmacogenetic interactions of mitotane are influenced by genes affecting its metabolism and transport, with CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 being primary enzymes for its metabolism and variations in these genes potentially altering mitotane's plasma levels and efficacy. Additionally, mitotane is a substrate of the transporter ABCB1, and variations in this gene could affect mitotane's pharmacokinetics and toxicity, while binding interactions with thyroxine-binding globulin (SERPINA7), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and corticosteroid-binding globulin (SERPINA6) could influence its distribution and activity in the body.
