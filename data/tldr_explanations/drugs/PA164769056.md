Tiotropium is influenced by pharmacogenetic interactions involving minimal metabolism by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 variants, and variability in muscarinic receptor genes such as CHRM3, which might impact the drug's efficacy and side effects due to alterations in drug levels and receptor responses. Additionally, genes like SLC22A5 and SLC22A4 can affect its renal clearance, further influencing individual therapeutic outcomes and variability in patient response.
