Larotrectinib sulfate targets the products of NTRK gene fusions (NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3), which encode the neurotrophin receptors TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC, respectively. The drug's efficacy depends on inhibiting the proteins produced from these gene fusions, as these altered receptors are significant in the development of various cancers, making the presence of these fusions critical in determining a tumor's response to larotrectinib.
