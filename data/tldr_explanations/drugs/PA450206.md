Levetiracetam primarily interacts with the SV2A protein, enhancing its control over synaptic vesicle activity and neurotransmitter release, crucial for managing neuronal excitability and seizure propagation, with minimal genetic variability impacting this interaction. Additionally, levetiracetam's interaction with the CACNA1B gene and the ABCB1 transporter protein may affect its antiepileptic effects and pharmacokinetics, respectively, though these interactions' significance remains unclear due to limited evidence of pronounced pharmacogenetic impacts.
