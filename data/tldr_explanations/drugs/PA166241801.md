Mutations in the genes MT-RNR1 and MT-ND1 are associated with increased susceptibility to ototoxicity from aminoglycosides like Micronomicin. MT-RNR1 is linked to the susceptibility because it plays a role in mitochondrial ribosomal function, which is similarly targeted by aminoglycosides, while MT-ND1 is involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, potentially exacerbating the toxicity by affecting cellular energy metabolism.
