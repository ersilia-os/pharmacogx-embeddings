Atomoxetine's metabolism and clinical response are significantly influenced by genetic variability, primarily involving the CYP2D6 gene, which determines metabolizer status (poor, intermediate, extensive, or ultrarapid) and affects atomoxetine's plasma concentrations and side effect risks. Additionally, the CYP2C19 gene plays a secondary role in its metabolism, while the SLC6A2 gene impacts its pharmacodynamics through norepinephrine reuptake inhibition, crucial for its effectiveness in treating ADHD; HTR7 may also influence treatment outcomes through serotonergic pathways, though its role is less clearly defined.
