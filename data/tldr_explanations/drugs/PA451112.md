Genetic variations in the MAOA and MAOB genes affect both the psychotropic side effects and possibly the antineoplastic activity of procarbazine due to their role in neurotransmitter breakdown. Variations in the XDH gene influence the hepatic metabolism of procarbazine, affecting the drug's metabolism rate, resulting in different drug levels and related toxicity among individuals.
