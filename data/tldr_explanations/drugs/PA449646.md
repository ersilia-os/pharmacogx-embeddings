The metabolism of flecainide is primarily influenced by the CYP2D6 gene, where genetic variants can lead to differences in enzyme activity, affecting drug levels and efficacy. Other genes such as CYP3A5, CYP1A2, SCN4A, and ADRB1 also play roles in its metabolism and pharmacodynamics, impacting heart rhythm and drug response variability.
