Tucatinib, a treatment for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, undergoes pharmacogenetic interactions that can affect its metabolism and transport. The enzymes CYP2C8, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, and CYP3A43 are involved in its metabolism, with genetic variations in CYP2C8 playing a significant role in altering tucatinib's efficacy and safety. Transport proteins such as ABCG2, ABCB1, SLC22A2, SLC47A1, and SLC47A2 also affect the drugâ€™s absorption and disposition, potentially impacting drug concentration at target sites and therapeutic outcomes.
