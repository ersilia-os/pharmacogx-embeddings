Fluoxetine's metabolic processing is primarily influenced by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6, the polymorphisms of which affect individuals' metabolic rates, impacting drug efficacy and safety. Additionally, CYP2C9 and ABCB1 also play roles in its metabolism and distribution, respectively, while fluoxetine's inhibition of CYP3A5 and CYP2C19 affects the clearance and efficacy of other medications administered concurrently.
