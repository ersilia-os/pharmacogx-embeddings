Genetic variations in genes such as SLC22A1, SLC22A2, DRD2, GRIN3A, CHRNA7, CHRNA4, and CHRNA3 affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of amantadine, potentially influencing its absorption, distribution, and interaction with dopaminergic and cholinergic receptors. Consequently, these genetic polymorphisms can modify the drug’s effectiveness and tolerability in the treatment of conditions like influenza A, Parkinson’s disease, and drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions.
