Gliquidone's effectiveness and risk of side effects, such as hypoglycemia, are influenced by genetic variations in the CYP2C9 gene, which affect how the drug is metabolized in the liver. Additionally, genetic variants in the ABCC8 and KCNJ8 genes, which regulate pancreatic beta-cell potassium channels, can alter how effectively gliquidone triggers insulin release by affecting cellular depolarization and calcium influx.
