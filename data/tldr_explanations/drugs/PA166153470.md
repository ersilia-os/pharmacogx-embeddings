Ribociclib, primarily metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme, is affected by genetic variants in this enzyme, which can alter drug bioavailability and efficacy; for example, individuals with reduced function alleles of CYP3A4 may have higher levels of the drug and an increased risk of toxicity. Additionally, while genes like PGR, ERBB2, ESR1, and ESR2 are involved in pathways pertinent to breast cancer and its treatment with ribociclib, they do not directly impact its metabolism or pharmacokinetic effects.
