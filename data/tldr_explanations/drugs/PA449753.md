Gentamicin's interactions with human genes like SLC22A2, LRP2, and ABCC2 influence its pharmacokinetics by affecting its transport, renal uptake, excretion, and secretion, which may alter its nephrotoxicity and efficacy. Additionally, variants in mitochondrial genes MT-RNR1 and MT-ND1 impact susceptibility to ototoxicity by affecting mitochondrial functions, as these genes are involved in encoding components of the mitochondrial ribosome and respiratory chain enzymes, respectively.
