Pralsetinib's metabolism is predominantly influenced by CYP3A4, with CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 also playing roles, much that genetic variations in these enzymes can alter the drug's efficacy and toxicity. Additionally, pralsetinib interacts with transport proteins like ABCB1, ABCG2, SLCO1B1, and SLCO1B3, where gene variants might affect the medication's absorption and distribution, potentially modifying therapeutic outcomes and side effects.
