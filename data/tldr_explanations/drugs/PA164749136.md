Desflurane's pharmacokinetics are influenced by genetic variability in CYP2E1, which, although minimally involved in its metabolism, can affect anesthetic levels and recovery times. Pharmacodynamic responses to desflurane are influenced by genetic variations in the GABA(A) receptor subunits (GABRA1 and GABRA2), and susceptibility to severe reactions like malignant hyperthermia is affected by genes such as RYR1 and CACNA1S.
