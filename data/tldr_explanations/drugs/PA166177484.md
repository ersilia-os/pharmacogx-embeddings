Enasidenib, an inhibitor targeting mutant forms of isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2), specifically acts on mutations such as IDH2-R140Q, IDH2-R172S, and IDH2-R172K, crucial for its effectiveness in cancer therapy. Its metabolism is influenced by genes encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2B6), transport proteins (e.g., ABCB1, SLCO1B1), and UGT enzymes (e.g., UGT1A1, UGT1A3), suggesting that genetic variations in these genes can significantly affect the drug's plasma levels and patient outcomes.
