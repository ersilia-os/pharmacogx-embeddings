Rivaroxaban's pharmacogenetics involve key interactions with CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and ABCB1 genes that influence its metabolism and transport. Variants in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 affect the enzyme's ability to biotransform rivaroxaban, altering its plasma levels and anticoagulant efficacy; whereas, ABCB1 gene variations impact rivaroxaban's bioavailability and elimination by encoding P-glycoprotein which modulates drug's cellular efflux.
