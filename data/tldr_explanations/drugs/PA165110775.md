SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, is primarily metabolized by UGT1A1 through glucuronidation to SN-38G, reducing toxicity and aiding excretion, with variants like UGT1A1*28 leading to higher toxicity due to reduced enzyme activity. Other genes such as ABCC1, ABCB1 (involved in efflux), UGT1A9, and SLCO1B1 (implicated in hepatic uptake) also play roles in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of SN-38, influencing its efficacy and safety.
