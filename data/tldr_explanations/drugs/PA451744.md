Variants in the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 genes influence the metabolism of trazodone, affecting its plasma concentration and thus its therapeutic outcomes and side effects. Additionally, genetic variations in serotonin-related genes, including SLC6A4, HTR2A, and HTR2C, influence the pharmacodynamics of trazodone by affecting serotonin transport and receptor interaction, which are critical for its antidepressant efficacy and side effects like weight gain or sexual dysfunction. Furthermore, the ABCB1 gene impacts the transport of trazodone across the blood-brain barrier, influencing its effectiveness and side effects by altering brain levels. These genetic interactions are pivotal in tailoring personalized trazodone therapy.
