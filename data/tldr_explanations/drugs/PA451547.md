The efficacy and tolerability of sulfasalazine, utilized in treating inflammatory conditions, are influenced by pharmacogenetic interactions involving the transport gene ABCG2, which affects the drug’s absorption and bioavailability, and the NAT2 gene, crucial in the liver metabolism of sulfapyridine—a key metabolite. Variants in these genes can alter drug levels in the body, affecting efficacy and the risk of side effects such as hypersensitivity reactions, while other genes like SLC19A1, CYP2D6, MTR, HLA-B, G6PD, TYMS, and C18orf56 play subtler, more indirect roles in its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behaviors.
