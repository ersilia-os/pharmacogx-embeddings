Oxcarbazepine's pharmacokinetics are influenced by ABCB1 transport proteins that manage its bioavailability and distribution, with genetic variants in ABCB1 potentially altering therapeutic levels and drug efficacy. On the pharmacodynamic front, genetic variants in the HLA gene locus, specifically HLA-B*1502 and HLA-A*3101, increase the risk of severe dermatological reactions like Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, impacting patient safety and necessitating careful consideration of oxcarbazepine use in affected individuals.
