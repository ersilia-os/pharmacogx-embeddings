Oliceridine's pharmacodynamics involve acting as a biased agonist at the Î¼-opioid receptor (OPRM1), affecting pain signaling through changes in ion conductivity in neurons, while its pharmacokinetics are influenced by cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Variations in these genes, notably CYP2D6, significantly impact the metabolism rate of oliceridine, thereby affecting drug plasma levels, efficacy, and safety, with implications for tailoring dosage to minimize risks like respiratory depression or constipation.
