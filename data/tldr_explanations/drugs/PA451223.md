Ramipril's metabolism into its active metabolite, ramiprilat, is driven by the liver enzyme BCHE, and variations in BCHE can alter the drug's efficacy and safety. Additionally, the ACE gene influences how effectively ramipril lowers blood pressure and alters cardiovascular risk, with different ACE genotypes causing variable patient responses. Moreover, genetic variations in the BDKRB1 receptor might affect the occurrence or severity of cough, a side effect associated with ACE inhibitors like ramipril. These genetic interactions are crucial in determining the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses to ramipril in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
