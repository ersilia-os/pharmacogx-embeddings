Selpercatinib's metabolism is significantly affected by genetic variations in the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C8, impacting its plasma levels, efficacy, and potential toxicity, with polymorphisms in CYP3A4 altering enzyme activity and affecting drug concentration. Additionally, genetic variants in transporter proteins such as ABCB1 and ABCG2 influence selpercatinib's distribution and elimination, affecting patient responses and necessitating potential dosing adjustments to optimize therapeutic outcomes.
