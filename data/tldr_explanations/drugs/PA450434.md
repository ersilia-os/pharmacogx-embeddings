Genes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP2E1 influence the pharmacokinetics of methoxyflurane by affecting its liver metabolism, impacting drug clearance and varying toxicity profiles. On the pharmacodynamic side, variations in genes related to neurotransmitter receptors (GABRA, GLRA) and potassium channels (KCNA1), as well as calcium channels and sensitivity genes (CACNA1S, RYR1), can affect the anesthetic and sedative effects of methoxyflurane and susceptibility to adverse reactions like malignant hyperthermia.
