Genetic variants in the mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1) affect the analgesic and sedative responses to oxymorphone due to changes in receptor structure and function, impacting both therapeutic outcomes and adverse effects. Additionally, variations in the enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 alter the drug's metabolism and plasma levels, leading to differences in efficacy and side effect profiles, which necessitates personalized dosing to accommodate these genetic differences.
