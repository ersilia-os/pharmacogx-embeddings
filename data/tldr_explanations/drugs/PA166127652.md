The pharmacogenetic interaction of the drug 4-hydroxytamoxifen is influenced by the activity and genetic variants of metabolic enzymes such as CYP2D6, which is critical for its conversion from tamoxifen into its active form. Additionally, genes like SULT1A1 and UGT2B15 further metabolize 4-hydroxytamoxifen, affecting its solubility, excretion, and elimination; variations in these genes can significantly alter drug efficacy and safety, emphasizing the importance of these genetic factors in personalized cancer treatment strategies.
