Genetic variations in dopamine receptor gene DRD2 and serotonin receptor HTR2A affect the efficacy and side effects of flupentixol due to its antagonistic actions on these receptors. Additionally, variations in CES1, which metabolizes flupentixol, and ABCB1, a transporter protein, influence the drug's plasma levels, distribution, and elimination, thereby impacting its therapeutic effectiveness and toxicity.
