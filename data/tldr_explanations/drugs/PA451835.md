Urofollitropin mainly interacts with the FSHR gene, which influences its effectiveness in fertility treatments by affecting the binding capacity of the FSH receptor involved in ovulation induction. Genetic variations in the FSHR gene can significantly alter the drug's action by affecting follicular response, critical in therapies like IVF where this drug stimulates follicular growth.
