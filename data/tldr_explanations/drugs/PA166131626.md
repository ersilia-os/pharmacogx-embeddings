Osimertinib, a drug for NSCLC, targets mutations in the EGFR gene, including T790M, exon 19 deletions, and L858R, which are critical for its therapeutic effectiveness by influencing cancer cell sensitivity. The drug's metabolism involves mainly CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP1A2, while its distribution and elimination are affected by ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters, with genetic variations in these enzymes and transporters impacting osimertinib's efficacy and toxicity.
