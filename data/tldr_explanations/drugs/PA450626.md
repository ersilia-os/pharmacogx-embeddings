Nicotine pharmacogenetics is influenced by key genes such as CYP2A6, which is primarily responsible for metabolizing nicotine into cotinine, and to a lesser extent by CYP2B6 and CYP2E1, leading to individual variations in metabolism rates that affect smoking cessation efficacy and tobacco dependence. Additionally, genes like CHRNA3, which affect nicotine's pharmacodynamic interactions by mediating receptor sensitivity, and SLC22A2, which influences nicotine's cellular uptake, further contribute to variations in individual responses to nicotine-based therapies.
