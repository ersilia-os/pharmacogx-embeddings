Protriptyline's interaction with genetic components such as SLC6A2 and SLC6A4 affects its pharmacodynamics by altering serotonin and norepinephrine uptake, influencing the drug’s effectiveness and side effects. Additionally, the ABCB1 gene impacts its pharmacokinetics by encoding the P-glycoprotein, which affects the drug’s distribution and elimination; variations in these genes can significantly influence individual responses, potentially necessitating dose adjustments to optimize therapy and minimize adverse effects.
