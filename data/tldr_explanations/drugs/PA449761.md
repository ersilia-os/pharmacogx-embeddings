The pharmacokinetics of glimepiride are significantly influenced by genetic variations in CYP2C9, which affects drug metabolism, leading to potential changes in hypoglycemia risk. Additionally, genetic differences in KCNJ11 and ABCC8, which encode for ATP-sensitive potassium channel subunits that glimepiride targets, can alter the drug's efficacy by affecting insulin release. Other genes like SLCO1B1 and SLC22A1, involved in drug transport, along with NOS1AP and G6PD, which influence metabolic responses and oxidative stress, also play roles in the drug's overall effect and patient-specific response.
