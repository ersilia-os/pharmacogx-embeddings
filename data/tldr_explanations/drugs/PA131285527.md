Genetic variations in enzymes like GSTP1, GSTM1, GSTT1, and NQO1, which are involved in the metabolism and detoxification of oxaliplatin, significantly influence the drug's effectiveness and side effects. Additionally, variations in transporters such as ABCG2, ABCC2, SLC22A2, SLC22A3, SLC31A1, ATP7A, and ATP7B affect oxaliplatinâ€™s pharmacokinetics and intracellular concentrations, impacting its cytotoxic efficacy and drug resistance.
