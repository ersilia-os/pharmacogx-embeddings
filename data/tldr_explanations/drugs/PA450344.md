Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) pharmacogenetics interacts with metabolic enzymes, including CYP3A4 and CYP2C8, affecting drug clearance and plasma concentrations through genetic variations such as CYP3A4*22, which may decrease enzyme efficiency leading to increased drug levels. Additionally, variations in hormone receptors like progesterone receptor (PGR) and estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1), as well as the impact of other genes such as HSD3B2 on steroid metabolism, ABCB1 on drug distribution, and ALB on drug bioavailability, influence the efficacy and therapeutic outcomes of the drug.
