Indomethacinâ€™s metabolism and effects are significantly influenced by genetic variations in the enzymes CYP2C9 and UGT1A1, which affect its metabolic rate and clearance, and by variations in the PTGS1 gene, which can alter the drug's anti-inflammatory effectiveness. Variants in CYP2C9 can lead to altered blood concentrations of indomethacin, potentially increasing efficacy and toxicity, while UGT1A1 polymorphisms can affect drug clearance, impacting accumulation and side effects, and PTGS1 variants vary the response to indomethacin's inhibition of COX enzymes.
