The metabolism of phenazepam is significantly influenced by the CYP2C19 gene, with variants leading to different metabolic rates that affect the drug's plasma concentration and duration of action. Additionally, genetic variations in the GABA_A receptor subunits impact the drug's efficacy in modulating GABAergic inhibition, which influences therapeutic outcomes and side effect profiles through its pharmacodynamics.
