Sacubitril's activation and efficacy are influenced by genetic variations in the CES1 gene, which affects its conversion into the active metabolite LBQ657. Additionally, polymorphisms in the SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3 genes impact the transport efficiency of Sacubitril and its metabolites, altering distribution and elimination processes, and potentially affecting drug levels and associated risks of adverse effects.
