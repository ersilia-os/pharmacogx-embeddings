Lorlatinib, a drug used for ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC, is metabolized by the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, whose genetic variations can significantly influence the drug's plasma concentration, effectiveness, and toxicity. These variations affect lorlatinib's metabolism and clearance rates, while mutations in the ALK gene can impact its therapeutic efficacy by altering drug resistance, indicating the importance of these genetic interactions in personalizing treatment plans.
