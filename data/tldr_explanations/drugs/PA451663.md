Thioguanine requires activation through HPRT1 and its metabolism is significantly influenced by genetic variants in TPMT (e.g., rs1800460 and rs1142345) that modulate the drug's toxicity, notably causing severe bone marrow suppression due to reduced TPMT enzyme activity. Additionally, the ABCC4 gene affects thioguanine’s pharmacokinetics by mediating the drug metabolites’ efflux, while other genes like XDH, UGT1A1, NAT1, and NUDT15 could potentially affect its metabolism and efficacy based on their roles in metabolic pathways, though their specific interactions with thioguanine are less well-defined.
