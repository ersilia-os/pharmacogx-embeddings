Isoflurane is minimally metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, notably CYP2E1, with genetic variability in this enzyme affecting isoflurane clearance to some extent. Additionally, isoflurane modulates pharmacodynamics through interactions with neurotransmitter systems, involving genes such as GABRA1, GABRA2, GABRG2, and KCNA1, which influence the drug's effects on neural excitability and anesthetic efficacy, while genes like CACNA1S and RYR1 may also impact sensitivity through muscle excitation and calcium signaling pathways.
