Siponimod, an S1P receptor modulator used in treating relapsing multiple sclerosis, primarily interacts with CYP2C9, which is responsible for its metabolism. Genetic variations in CYP2C9 can lead to different metabolic rates of Siponimod, affecting drug levels in the blood and influencing both efficacy and potential adverse effects; as such, these variations necessitate individualized dosing adjustments to optimize treatment safety and effectiveness.
