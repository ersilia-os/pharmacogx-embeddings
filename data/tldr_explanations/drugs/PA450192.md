Leflunomide's effectiveness and safety are influenced by interactions with genes like CYP1A2 and CYP2C9, which are involved in the drug's hepatic metabolism, and ABCG2, which affects drug distribution and excretion. Additionally, variations in these genes can lead to differing metabolic rates, potentially impacting drug levels, efficacy, and risk of toxicity. The drug's pharmacodynamics involve DHODH, an enzyme targeted by leflunomide to inhibit lymphocyte proliferation, essential in treating conditions like rheumatoid arthritis.
