The pharmacogenetic profile of oseltamivir is influenced by the CES1 gene, which is critical for the metabolic activation of the drug, and variants in CES1 can affect the transformation of oseltamivir to its active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate, impacting its antiviral efficacy. Additionally, ABCC4, a transporter gene, may alter the pharmacokinetics of the drug by affecting the distribution and excretion of oseltamivir and its metabolites, thereby influencing drug levels and modifying therapeutic outcomes.
