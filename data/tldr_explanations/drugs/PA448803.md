The effectiveness and toxicity of carboplatin, a chemotherapy drug used for ovarian cancer, are influenced by interactions with genes such as GSTP1, GSTM1, and GSTT1, which are involved in detoxification, and ATP7B and ABCG2, which regulate its intracellular concentration. Variations in these genes affect how the drug is metabolized, determining individual responses and potential resistance to the treatment.
