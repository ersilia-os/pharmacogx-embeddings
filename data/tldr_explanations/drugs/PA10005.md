The effectiveness and safety of adefovir dipivoxil, primarily affected by its renal elimination and activation mechanisms, are influenced by genetic variations in specific transporters and kinases. Variants in the transporters SLC22A6 and ABCC4 may affect drug clearance and toxicity, while polymorphisms in kinases like AK2, AK4, NME1, and NME2 could alter the activation of the prodrug, impacting its antiviral efficacy.
