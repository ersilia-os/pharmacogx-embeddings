Misoprostol's pharmacological effects, such as reducing gastric acid secretion and stimulating uterine contractions, are mediated through the activation of PTGER1, PTGER2, PTGER3, and PTGER4 receptor subtypes. Genetic variations in these receptor genes could influence individual responses to misoprostol, affecting drug efficacy and side effect profiles, although specific pharmacokinetic interactions involving metabolism or transport enzymes are not evident.
