The pharmacogenetic profile of spironolactone is influenced by genes impacting its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Variants in CYP2C8 alter its metabolism and efficacy, affecting its diuretic and antihypertensive effects, while CYP11B2 variations can modify spironolactone's effectiveness by influencing aldosterone production. Moreover, genetic differences in NR3C2, which encodes the mineralocorticoid receptor, crucially affect the drug's response in managing hypertension and heart failure. Other genetic factors including NOS3, CYP4A11, CYP4F2, ADD1, ADRB1, ADRB2, and ACE also potentially impact its efficacy, primarily through mechanisms related to blood pressure regulation and renal function.
