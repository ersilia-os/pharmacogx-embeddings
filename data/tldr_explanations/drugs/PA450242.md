Lisinopril interacts pharmacodynamically with the ACE gene by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and with the REN gene affecting the initial conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, impacting blood pressure regulation. Genetic variations in these genes, such as the ACE alleles (I and D), significantly influence lisinopril's efficacy and side effects, making genetic differences crucial in determining individual therapeutic responses to the drug.
