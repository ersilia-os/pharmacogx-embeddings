Clavulanic acid functions primarily as a beta-lactamase inhibitor with its action targeting bacterial enzymes rather than human genetic variations, hence showing limited direct pharmacogenetic interactions. However, variations in human transport proteins, such as those encoded by the gene SLC5A1, could influence the absorption and pharmacokinetics of clavulanic acid, potentially affecting its effectiveness in combination with other antibiotics.
