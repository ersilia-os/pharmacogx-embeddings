Capmatinib pharmacogenetic interactions involve mutations in the MET gene, which are crucial for predicting therapeutic responsiveness in NSCLC treatment, and variants in CYP3A4 that affect its metabolism. Additionally, genetic variations in transporters such as ABCB1, SLC47A1, SLC47A2, and ABCG2 influence the drug's bioavailability and excretion, impacting its efficacy and safety.
