Bacampicillin, a prodrug of ampicillin, is activated by intestinal esterases, and its efficacy might be influenced by genetic variations in these enzymes. Furthermore, once converted to ampicillin, it targets bacterial genes such as dacA, dacB, dacC, mrcA, mrcB, mrdA, and ftsI, which encode penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), essential for understanding resistance patterns in bacteria.
