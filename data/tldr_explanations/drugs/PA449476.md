Genetic variations in key genes like **UGT2B7**, **ABCC1**, and **TOP2A** significantly influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of epirubicin. These variations can impact epirubicin's metabolism, elimination, and its ability to inhibit the DNA replication enzyme TOP2A, thereby affecting the drug's toxicity and anticancer efficacy. Additionally, genes such as **CBR3**, **SLCO1B1**, **ABCC2**, and **GSTT1** also play roles in the metabolism, distribution, excretion, and detoxification of epirubicin, further influencing its effectiveness and safety profile.
