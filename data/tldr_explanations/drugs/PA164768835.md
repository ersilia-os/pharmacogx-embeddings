Maraviroc's effectiveness in treating CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infection is influenced by genetic variants of the CCR5 gene, such as the CCR5-Δ32 mutation, which can modify the receptor's structure or expression and affect drug efficacy. Additionally, the drug's metabolism is largely dependent on CYP3A4, an enzyme whose activity varies due to genetic polymorphisms, altering the drug’s pharmacokinetics, effectiveness, and side effect profile.
