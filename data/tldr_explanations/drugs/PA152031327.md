Geldanamycin, an HSP90 inhibitor, targets the HSP90 isoforms HSP90B1, HSP90AA1, and HSP90AB1, disrupting the protein folding activity crucial for the survival of cancer cells by promoting the degradation of oncogenic client proteins like EGFR. Genetic variations in these HSP90 isoforms and their client proteins may influence the effectiveness of geldanamycin by affecting how this drug induces degradation of these proteins, ultimately impacting therapeutic outcomes in cancer treatment.
