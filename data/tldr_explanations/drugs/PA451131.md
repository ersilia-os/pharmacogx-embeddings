Propafenone metabolism is significantly influenced by the CYP2D6 gene, which encodes an enzyme that converts propafenone into less active metabolites; this affects the drug's plasma concentration and therapeutic efficacy, varying with patients' genetic differences from poor to ultra-rapid metabolizers. Additionally, propafenone interacts with other genes such as SCN5A, which influences cardiac sodium channels, ADRB1 and ADRB2, which affect its beta-blocking effects, and ABCB1, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2 that modulate its pharmacokinetics and clearance, thereby impacting the drug's efficacy and safety profiles in patient-specific ways.
