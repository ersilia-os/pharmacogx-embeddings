Ritonavir's pharmacogenetics are influenced by its interactions with metabolic enzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, which play crucial roles in the drug's metabolism, affecting its plasma levels and interaction with other protease inhibitors. Transporter genes like ABCB1 also modify ritonavir's pharmacokinetics by affecting its distribution and elimination, while variations in other genes such as SLCO1B1, CYP3A5, UGT1A1, and additional members of the UGT and ABC transporter families impact its absorption, metabolism, and excretion.
