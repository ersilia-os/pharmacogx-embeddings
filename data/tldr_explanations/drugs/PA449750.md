Gemfibrozil's effects and metabolism are largely influenced by its interaction with genes such as CYP2C8, which is vital for its metabolic breakdown, UGT1A1 and UGT2B7, which are involved in its glucuronidation and elimination, and PPARÎ±, which mediates its lipid-regulating effects. Variants in these genes can alter gemfibrozil's plasma concentrations and efficacy, impacting both its therapeutic outcomes and potential for drug-drug interactions.
