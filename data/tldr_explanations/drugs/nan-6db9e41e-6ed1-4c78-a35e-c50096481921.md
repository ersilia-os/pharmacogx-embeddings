Linezolid's pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties may be impacted by genetic variants in human enzymes such as MAOA and MAOB, which it inhibits, potentially raising the risk of serotonin syndrome when used with other serotonergic drugs. Additionally, genetic variations in transporters like SLC22A6 and SLC22A8, crucial for its renal excretion, as well as variations in the albumin gene affecting ALB binding, can influence the drug's clearance, distribution, and half-life.
