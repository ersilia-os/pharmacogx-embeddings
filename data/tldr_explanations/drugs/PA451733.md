The metabolism of torasemide is significantly affected by genetic variants in CYP2C9 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, with variations like CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 leading to reduced enzyme activity and potentially higher drug concentrations, increasing the risk of side effects such as hypotension or electrolyte imbalances. Additionally, genetic factors may also influence the role of transporters like SLCO1B1 in torasemide's hepatic uptake, though these interactions are less clearly understood.
