Genetic variations in CES1 affect the rate at which heroin is metabolized to morphine, impacting the drug’s efficacy and safety, while polymorphic genes like OPRM1, OPRK1, and OPRD1 influence how morphine interacts with opioid receptors, affecting pain perception, addiction risk, and opioid sensitivity. Additionally, genes such as MAOA, COMT, and transporters like SLC6A3 indirectly modulate heroin’s effects through their roles in neurotransmitter pathways, contributing further to individual differences in drug response and potential side effects.
