Disulfiram inhibits the enzyme ALDH2, escalating acetaldehyde syndrome symptoms to deter alcohol consumption, with its effectiveness and safety impacted by ALDH2 genetic variants, especially in East Asian populations. Additionally, disulfiram's metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2E1, and its potential interactions with dopamine metabolism through DBH and genes like DRD2 and ANKK1, suggest that genetic variability can significantly influence both the metabolic rate and neurological effects of the drug.
