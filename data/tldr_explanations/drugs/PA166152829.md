Flupirtine's analgesic effects are partially mediated by its interaction with the alpha-2A adrenergic receptor (ADRA2A) and potentially influenced by genetic polymorphisms in ADRA2A, which could impact its efficacy or adverse effects. Additionally, genetic variations in liver enzymes, such as cytochrome P450, which are involved in the hepatic metabolism of flupirtine, may also affect the drug's processing and bioavailability, thus influencing individual responses in terms of therapeutic effectiveness and potential toxicity.
