The metabolism of meloxicam is primarily influenced by CYP2C9, where alleles such as CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 reduce the enzyme's activity, leading to slower metabolism, increased drug levels, and potentially greater efficacy and risk of side effects. CYP3A4 also affects meloxicam's pharmacokinetics to a lesser extent, and the drug's transport involves ABCC4, although specific genetic interactions are less documented.
