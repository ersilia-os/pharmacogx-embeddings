Finasteride's efficacy and side effects are influenced by genetic variances in the SRD5A2 gene, which codes for the Type II 5Î±-reductase enzyme that finasteride targets to reduce DHT production. Additionally, variants in the CYP3A genes (CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7), which are responsible for metabolizing finasteride, can affect the drug's pharmacokinetics, altering its plasma levels and clinical effectiveness.
