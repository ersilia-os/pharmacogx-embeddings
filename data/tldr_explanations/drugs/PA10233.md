The metabolism of voriconazole is significantly influenced by genetic variations in enzymes such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which determine individual metabolic rates, affecting drug levels and efficacy. Other genes like ABCC2, POR, and ABCB1 also play roles by altering enzyme activities or transporter functions, essentially impacting how voriconazole is absorbed and excreted, highlighting the need for personalized dosing based on genetic testing.
