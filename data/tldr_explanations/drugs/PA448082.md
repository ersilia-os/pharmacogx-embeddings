Alendronate's effectiveness and safety in preventing bone loss may be influenced by genetic variations in genes such as DKK1 and SOST, which regulate bone density, and MVK and VDR, which are involved in the mevalonate pathway and vitamin D metabolism, respectively. These variations in genes associated with bone metabolism could potentially modulate the response to alendronate, despite the drug's minimal systemic bioavailability and metabolism.
