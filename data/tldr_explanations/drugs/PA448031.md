Genetic variations in ACHE and BCHE genes can significantly influence the breakdown of acetylcholine (ACh), altering its availability and efficacy at synaptic junctions. Additionally, variations in muscarinic and nicotinic receptor genes (CHRM1, CHRM2, CHRM3, CHRM4, CHRNA7) and transport protein genes (SLC22A5, SLC22A1) can modify the pharmacodynamic responses and systemic distribution of ACh, impacting drug efficacy and side effects in therapies targeting the cholinergic system.
