Sorafenib metabolism involves multiple enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C8, as well as glucuronidation by UGT1A9, where genetic variants can affect drug clearance, metabolism speed, and efficacy. Additionally, its pharmacodynamics are influenced by interactions with kinases like BRAF and RAF1 and transporters like ABCB1 and ABCG2, where genetic variations can alter drug targeting, distribution, and excretion, affecting overall therapeutic outcomes and potential for adverse reactions.
