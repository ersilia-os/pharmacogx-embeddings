Betamethasone's interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) and polymorphisms in this gene can affect sensitivity to the drug, impacting therapeutic and adverse responses. Additionally, genes like CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and ABCB1, which are involved in the metabolism and transport of betamethasone, harbor variations that might alter the drug's clearance and systemic availability, thereby affecting dosing requirements and overall drug effectiveness.
