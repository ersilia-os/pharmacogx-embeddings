Genetic variations in the genes TPH1, TPH2, IDO1, TDO2, and SLC22A2 significantly impact tryptophan's metabolism through the serotonin and kynurenine pathways, affecting serotonin synthesis, tryptophan catabolism, and its cellular uptake. These variations can influence clinical outcomes related to mood disorders, sleep disturbances, neurodegeneration, and immune responses, altering the effectiveness of tryptophan-based treatments.
