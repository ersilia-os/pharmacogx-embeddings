Ixabepilone's pharmacokinetic interactions involve the CYP3A4 enzyme and the ABCB1 transporter. Genetic variations in CYP3A4 can alter ixabepilone's plasma levels, impacting its efficacy and toxicity, while variations in ABCB1 can affect the drug's cellular distribution and elimination, potentially leading to decreased effectiveness due to increased drug resistance.
