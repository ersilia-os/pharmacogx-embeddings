The pharmacogenetics of calcitriol involves genes such as VDR, CYP24A1, and CYP3A4. VDR genetic polymorphisms affect calcitriol's therapeutic efficacy by influencing gene transcription related to calcium balance and metabolic processes, while CYP24A1 mutations affect calcitriol's degradation rates and hence its dosage and effectiveness; variability in CYP3A4 also impacts calcitriolâ€™s metabolism but to a lesser extent.
