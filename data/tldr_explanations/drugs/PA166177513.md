Variants in the genes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 can significantly influence the metabolism of mirabegron, affecting its plasma levels and pharmacological efficacy, while genetic diversity in UGT enzymes (UGT2B7, UGT1A3, UGT1A8) and several transporters (ABCB1, SLCO1A2, SLC22A1, SLC22A2, SLC22A3) impacts the drugâ€™s clearance, bioavailability, and distribution, potentially altering therapeutic outcomes and adverse effects. Genetic variations in the ADRB3 receptor also play a role, directly affecting the therapeutic efficacy of mirabegron.
