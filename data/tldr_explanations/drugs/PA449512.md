Estrone's effectiveness and side effects are influenced by interactions with estrogen receptors ESR1 and ESR2, and by its metabolism through cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP1B1. Genetic variations in these receptors and enzymes can significantly affect the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of estrone, impacting its overall therapeutic efficacy and safety profile in hormone replacement therapies.
