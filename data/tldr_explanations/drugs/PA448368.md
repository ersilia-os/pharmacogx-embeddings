Amiloride's pharmacogenetic interaction is primarily influenced by its interaction with the genes SCNN1A, SCNN1B, SCNN1G, and SCNN1D, which encode the subunits of epithelial sodium channels crucial for its potassium-sparing effect by blocking sodium reabsorption in the kidneys. Additionally, amiloride's pharmacodynamics involve acid-sensing ion channels (ASIC1 and ASIC2) and the enzyme AOC1, which could influence pain perception and pharmacokinetics, while transporter genes like SLC22A2 and SLC22A4 impact its renal handling and excretion.
