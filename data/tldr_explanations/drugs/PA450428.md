Methotrexate (MTX) has pharmacogenetic interactions involving several key genes, such as MTHFR which affects MTX metabolism through folate pathway alterations leading to increased toxicity risk, TPMT that impacts MTX response via thiopurine metabolism, and various transport genes including ABCB1 and SLCO1B1 which alter MTX's pharmacokinetics through effects on drug efflux and hepatic uptake respectively. These genetic factors collectively influence MTX's efficacy and toxicity, guiding personalized dosing strategies to optimize treatment outcomes and minimize adverse effects.
