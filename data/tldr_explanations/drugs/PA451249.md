Rifabutin metabolism is significantly affected by the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2C8, and CYP2B6, as well as transport proteins like ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein). Genetic variants in these genes can alter the metabolic rate and distribution of rifabutin, leading to variations in drug efficacy and the risk of side effects such as uveitis or leukopenia.
