Genetic variations in the CYP2C9 enzyme significantly affect the metabolism of nateglinide, with polymorphisms such as CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 leading to decreased enzyme activity and slower drug metabolism, potentially increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. Additionally, transporter genes like ABCC4 and SLC22A6 influence the drug's pharmacokinetics by affecting drug efflux and elimination, respectively, with variations in these genes contributing to variability in drug response, impacting the effectiveness and safety of nateglinide in managing type 2 diabetes.
