Genes involved in immune response modulation and drug metabolism significantly influence the efficacy and safety of Levamisole. Variations in genes encoding immune system components, such as cytokines (e.g., IL1, TNF), could impact therapeutic outcomes and the risk of adverse reactions like agranulocytosis, while genetic differences in liver enzymes, specifically in the cytochrome P450 family, and detoxification genes like GSTP1 may affect Levamisole's metabolism, altering drug exposure and side effects.
