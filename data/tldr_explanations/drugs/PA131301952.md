The pharmacogenetics of gefitinib involve interactions with the EGFR gene, where polymorphisms such as rs121434568, rs28929495, and rs121913444 significantly affect patient responses, and with CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes, which influence its metabolism and plasma concentrations. Variants in these genes, along with the ABCG2 gene polymorphism rs2231142, which impacts drug excretion and side effects like diarrhea, are critical for optimizing gefitinib's therapeutic effects and minimizing adverse reactions through tailored dosing based on individual genetic profiles.
