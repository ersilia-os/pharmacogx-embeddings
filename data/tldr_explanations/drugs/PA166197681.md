Genetic variations in VKORC1 and CYP4F2 significantly influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of phylloquinone, a form of vitamin K1. VKORC1 mutations impact the recycling of vitamin K necessary for clotting factor activation, while CYP4F2 variations affect the catabolism of vitamin K1, altering its availability and thus influencing coagulation processes. These interactions are essential for determining the effectiveness of vitamin K1 in clotting and for adjusting dosages in treatments involving coagulation control.
