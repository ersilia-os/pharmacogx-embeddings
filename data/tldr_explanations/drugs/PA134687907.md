Formoterol metabolism is primarily influenced by genes like CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2A6, UGT1A1, and several other UGT enzymes, which affect its pharmacokinetics and can alter efficacy and side effects through changes in drug concentration and elimination rates. Pharmacodynamically, formoterol targets the ADRB2 gene related to the beta-2 adrenergic receptor, and genetic variations in ADRB2 and other adrenergic receptors (ADRB1, ADRB3) as well as transporter genes (SLC22A1, SLC22A3, SLC22A4, SLC22A5) can modify receptor response and drug bioavailability, thereby impacting therapeutic outcomes.
