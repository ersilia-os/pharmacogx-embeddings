Simeprevir, used in treating HCV, is influenced by genetic variations such as polymorphisms in the HCV NS3 protease (e.g., Q80K) that affect drug binding and resistance, and by genetic differences in metabolic enzymes like CYP3A4 that impact drug plasma levels. Additionally, carrier genes like SLCO1B1, IFNL3, and IFNL4 can alter the drugâ€™s hepatic uptake and the host's immune response, respectively, thereby affecting treatment efficacy and safety.
