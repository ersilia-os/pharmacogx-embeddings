Genetic variants in the CYP3A4 gene can significantly alter the metabolism of fluticasone propionate, impacting its clearance and leading to variations in drug efficacy and side effect risk. Additionally, polymorphisms in transporters such as ABCB1 and SLCO1B1, along with variations in the glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1, can influence the drug's absorption, distribution, and receptor sensitivity, affecting therapeutic outcomes and side effects.
