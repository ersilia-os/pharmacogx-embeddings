Genetic variations in the CYP2B6, CYP2C9, UGT1A9, UGT1A8, and ABCB1 genes influence the pharmacokinetics of propofol by affecting its hepatic hydroxylation, glucuronidation and elimination, significantly impacting the drug's metabolic clearance, and hence, its sedative effects. Additionally, variations in the GABRA1 and GABRA2 genes can modify the pharmacodynamic response to propofol, influencing its sedative efficacy, although these effects are less clearly established in clinical practice. These genetic interactions contribute to individual variability in metabolizing and responding to propofol, crucial for personalized anesthetic management.
