Variations in the UGT1A6 gene significantly influence the metabolism of deferiprone by affecting the conversion of the drug to its inactive form, deferiprone 3-O-glucuronide, which can alter the drug's effectiveness in iron chelation and the incidence of side effects. The genetic influences on the pharmacodynamics of deferiprone are less significant due to its specific role in iron chelation without direct interaction with cellular targets or involvement in complex signaling pathways.
