Tolbutamide metabolism is primarily mediated by CYP2C9, with variants like CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 leading to slower metabolism and increased risk of adverse effects such as hypoglycemia due to higher and prolonged plasma drug levels. Other genes such as CYP2C19 and G6PD also interact with tolbutamide; CYP2C19 influences its metabolism to a lesser extent, and while G6PD may increase the risk of hemolytic anemia, its direct impact on tolbutamide's pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics remains unclear.
