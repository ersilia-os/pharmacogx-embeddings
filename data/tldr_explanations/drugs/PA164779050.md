Sulfapyridine metabolism is chiefly managed by the enzyme CYP2C9, and genetic variations like CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 can lead to reduced enzyme activity, resulting in slower drug metabolism. This decreased metabolic rate may increase drug levels, prolonging exposure and potentially heightening the risk of adverse effects such as toxicity.
