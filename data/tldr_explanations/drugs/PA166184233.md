Vernakalant, a class III antiarrhythmic agent, undergoes metabolism predominantly via the CYP2D6 enzyme, where differences in metabolic rates between extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs) due to genetic polymorphisms may affect the drug's efficacy and safety, influencing dosing strategies. Additionally, Vernakalant interacts with various ion channels such as SCN5A-encoded sodium channels, KCNA5 and KCND3-encoded potassium channels, and KCNH2-encoded hERG channels, which are instrumental in its effects on atrial electrophysiology and cardiac safety.
