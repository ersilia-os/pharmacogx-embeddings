Rupatadine, which acts on the histamine H1 receptor and the platelet-activating factor receptor, is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4, with contributions from CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. Genetic polymorphisms in these cytochrome P450 enzymes affect the drug's pharmacokinetics, altering its concentration in the bloodstream, which can impact its effectiveness and safety, necessitating possible dosage adjustments.
