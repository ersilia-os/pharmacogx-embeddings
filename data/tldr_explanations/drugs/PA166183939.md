The pharmacogenetics of dextropropoxyphene is significantly influenced by the activity of the CYP3A4 enzyme, where genetic polymorphisms alter the drug's metabolism, impacting its efficacy and safety. Genetic variations in CYP3A4 can lead to either increased or decreased drug plasma levels, posing risks of toxicity or inadequate pain management, respectively. Additionally, variations in opioid receptors like OPRM1 may also affect the drugâ€™s analgesic efficacy and addiction potential, although these interactions are less clearly defined compared to other opioids.
