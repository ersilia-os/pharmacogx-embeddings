Genetic variations in key enzymes and transporters such as DCK, CDA, SLC29A1, SLC28A1, and RRM1 significantly influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of gemcitabine. These variations affect the drug's activation, breakdown, cellular uptake, and DNA synthesis disruption, thereby impacting its efficacy and toxicity in cancer treatment.
