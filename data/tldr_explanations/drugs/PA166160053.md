Brexpiprazole's interaction with the CYP2D6 gene significantly influences its pharmacogenetic profile, where variations in the gene affect the drug's metabolism into less active metabolites, impacting its plasma levels and effects. Depending on their CYP2D6 genotype, individuals may experience varying degrees of drug exposure, with poor metabolizers facing higher risks of adverse effects and ultra-rapid metabolizers potentially observing reduced drug efficacy, prompting considerations for dose adjustments or alternative treatments to optimize outcomes.
