The pharmacogenetics of Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) involves the influence of genetic variations in cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) and bile acid transporters (ABCB11 and SLC10A1) on its metabolism, clearance, and transport efficiency, affecting the drugâ€™s concentration, therapeutic efficacy, and potential for adverse effects. Additional impacts on UDCA's actions may arise from interactions with the bile acid receptor NR1H4, where genetic differences could further influence the regulation of bile acids.
