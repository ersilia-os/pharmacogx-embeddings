The pharmacokinetics of penicillamine, used for Wilson's disease and cystinuria, are influenced by the transporter gene SLCO1B1, where genetic variants can affect drug absorption and elimination, impacting its effectiveness and safety. Additionally, in the context of autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, the HLA-DRB1 gene plays a pharmacodynamic role by affecting the immune response to the drug, which can alter the treatment's effectiveness and potential drug reactions.
