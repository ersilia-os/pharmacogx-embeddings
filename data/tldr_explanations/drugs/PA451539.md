Genetic variations in the CYP2C8, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9 enzymes influence the metabolism and clearance of Sulfadiazine, affecting its efficacy and toxicity. Additionally, the G6PD gene plays a key role, as G6PD deficiency can result in hemolytic anemia in patients treated with Sulfadiazine due to increased oxidative stress in red blood cells.
