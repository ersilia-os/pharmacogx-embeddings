Morphine's efficacy and safety are influenced by pharmacogenetic interactions involving genes such as UGT2B7, UGT1A1, and UGT1A3 that affect its metabolism, and OPRM1, OPRK1, and OPRD1 that affect opioid receptor function. Additionally, ABCB1 gene variants impact the drug's distribution and elimination, highlighting the necessity for personalized medicine in morphine therapy to optimize treatment outcomes and minimize side effects.
