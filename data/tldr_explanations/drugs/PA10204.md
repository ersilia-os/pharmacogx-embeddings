Tenofovir's pharmacokinetic behavior, including its activation, transport, and elimination, is significantly influenced by the genetic variations in genes such as ABCB1, SLC22A6, ABCC2, ABCC10, ABCG2, and ABCC4, which encode for different transporters affecting the drug's bioavailability, distribution, and toxicity. Additionally, genetic markers like HLA-B can predispose individuals to hypersensitivity reactions, highlighting the importance of considering individual genetic profiles to optimize efficacy and minimize adverse effects of tenofovir therapy.
