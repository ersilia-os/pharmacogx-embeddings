The pharmacogenetics of artesunate are influenced by its metabolism through esterases, glucuronidation by UGT1A9 and UGT2B7, minor metabolism by CYP2A6, and interactions with transporter proteins such as ABCB1, ABCG2, SLCO1B1, and SLC22A8. Variations in these genes affect the pharmacokinetics of artesunate, altering drug efficacy and safety, with G6PD and IKBKG gene variants impacting treatment outcomes due to their roles in red blood cell stability and immune response, respectively.
