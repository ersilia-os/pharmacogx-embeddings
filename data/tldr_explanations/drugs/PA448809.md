Carisoprodol metabolism and its efficacy are significantly influenced by the CYP2C19 gene, which dictates the rate at which carisoprodol is converted to its active metabolite, meprobamate. Genetic variations in CYP2C19 can lead to different metabolic rates among individuals, with poor metabolizers experiencing prolonged effects and potential side effects due to slower drug clearance, while rapid metabolizers may see reduced effects as the drug is cleared more quickly.
