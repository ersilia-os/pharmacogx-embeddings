Chloramphenicol metabolism is heavily influenced by cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7, whose genetic polymorphisms can lead to variable drug metabolism rates, affecting drug efficacy and toxicity risks like aplastic anemia. Additionally, the distribution and elimination of chloramphenicol may be affected by genetic variants in the SLC22A6 transporter, while a genetic deficiency in G6PD poses a separate risk for hemolysis, which calls for careful consideration when using drugs causing oxidative stress.
