Dabrafenib's effectiveness as a kinase inhibitor in cancer treatment is primarily influenced by its interaction with BRAF mutations (V600E, V600K, V600D) and is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP3A4 and CYP2C8. Genetic variations in these enzymes, as well as transport proteins ABCB1 and ABCG2, can significantly affect the drug's plasma concentration, efficacy, and safety, necessitating potential dose adjustments based on individual genetic profiles. Additionally, genes like NRAS, HRAS, and KRAS, while not directly involved in dabrafenib's primary mechanism, can affect BRAF signaling pathways and hence the drug's cellular context.
