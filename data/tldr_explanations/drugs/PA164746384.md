Variations in the CYP1A2 gene influence the metabolism of nalidixic acid in the liver, affecting drug levels and toxicity; while polymorphisms in SLC22A6 impact its renal excretion, thus modifying drug response. Additionally, TDO2 variations may affect the formation of nalidixic acid metabolites, but their impact on overall drug metabolism is less significant compared to CYP1A2.
