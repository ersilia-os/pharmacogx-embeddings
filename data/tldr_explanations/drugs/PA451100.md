Prednisone is metabolized by enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2C19 affecting its pharmacokinetics through variations in metabolization rates, and influenced by transporter proteins like ABCB1 and variations in the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), altering its absorption, distribution, effectiveness, and side effect profile due to changes in P-glycoprotein function and receptor sensitivity or expression. These genetic factors contribute substantially to individual differences in response to the drug, making pharmacogenetic awareness crucial for optimizing treatment efficacy and reducing adverse effects.
