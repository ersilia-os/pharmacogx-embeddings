Pegaspargase, used in acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment, universally targets the amino acid asparagine in leukemia cells without involving specific genes affecting its pharmacodynamics. However, genes like HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DQA1, and IGHMBP2 may impact the immune response, influencing hypersensitivity or other immune-mediated reactions to the drug, suggesting a pharmacogenetic interaction that could guide personalized treatment by monitoring these genetic profiles.
