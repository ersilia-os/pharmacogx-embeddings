Docetaxel's pharmacogenetics are shaped by variations in genes that affect its metabolism and efflux, notably through the enzymatic activity of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, and transport via ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCC10, SLCO1B3, and SLCO1B1. Genetic polymorphisms in these enzymes and transporters can lead to differences in the drug's pharmacokinetics, efficacy, toxicity, and overall therapeutic outcomes, suggesting the possibility for personalized dosage adjustments in cancer treatment.
