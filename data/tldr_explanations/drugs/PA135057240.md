The metabolism of bupivacaine is significantly influenced by genetic variations in cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which can impact its clearance rates and pharmacokinetics. Variants that reduce enzyme activity can lead to prolonged exposure to the drug and increased risk of toxicity, while other polymorphisms can affect metabolic speed, influencing drug efficacy and safety. Non-P450 genes like CYB5R3 and G6PD also play roles in modifying the pharmacodynamic response to bupivacaine through their involvement in cellular processes like electron transport and glucose metabolism.
