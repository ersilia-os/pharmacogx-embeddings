Rosuvastatin metabolism is influenced by CYP2C9 and its pharmacokinetics are significantly affected by SLCO1B1 and ABCG2 gene variants, with the *15 allele of SLCO1B1 increasing hepatic uptake and plasma levels, potentially raising myopathy risk, and the c.421C>A polymorphism in ABCG2 altering intestinal absorption, affecting dose requirements. Additionally, efficacy in cholesterol reduction is influenced by polymorphisms in the HMGCR gene, which are central to the drug's pharmacodynamics.
