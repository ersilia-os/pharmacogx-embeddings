The effectiveness and toxicity of the chemotherapy drug cytarabine and its active metabolite ara-CTP in treating AML are influenced by genetic variants in key enzymes such as DCK, which is crucial for ara-CTP formation, and CDA, which is responsible for cytarabine catabolism. Additionally, genes such as CTPS1, RRM1, SLC28A1, and SLC28A3 affect ara-CTP activity by modifying substrate availability, DNA synthesis, and cellular drug uptake.
