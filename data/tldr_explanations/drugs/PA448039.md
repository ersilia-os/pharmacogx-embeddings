Acitretin's efficacy and safety are influenced by its interactions with specific retinoid receptors (RXRA, RXRB, RXRG, RARA, RARB, RARG) and other proteins (RBP1, ALB), where genetic variations in these encoding genes can affect the drug's action and patient response by altering skin cell growth, differentiation, drug distribution, and bioavailability. These interactions underscore the importance of understanding individual genetic differences to optimize treatment in psoriasis management.
