The pharmacogenetics of bisoprolol is influenced by gene interactions primarily with CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, which affect its metabolism, and ADRB1, which influences its pharmacodynamics by altering receptor sensitivity. Variations in these genes necessitate dose adjustments to optimize therapeutic effects and minimize side effects, while polymorphisms in ABCB1 also play a role in the drugâ€™s transport and excretion, impacting its pharmacokinetic behavior.
