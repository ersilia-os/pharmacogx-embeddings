Genetic variations in the OPRM1 gene can affect the binding and response to piritramide, an opioid analgesic, impacting its effectiveness and side effect profile. Additionally, variants in the CYP2D6 and ABCB1 genes can alter the metabolism and transport of piritramide, respectively, influencing the drug's concentration, efficacy, and elimination, thereby potentially modifying pain management outcomes and the risk of adverse effects.
