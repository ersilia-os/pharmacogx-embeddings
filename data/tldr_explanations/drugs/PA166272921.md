The pharmacokinetic profile of abrocitinib, a JAK1 selective inhibitor, is significantly influenced by genetic variants in cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C19 and CYP2C9, which are crucial in its metabolism, and by the transporter ABCB1, involved in its absorption and distribution. These genetic variations can lead to differences in drug concentration, affecting efficacy, toxicity, and overall therapeutic outcomes, making pharmacogenetic testing essential to customize treatment approaches for individual safety and effectiveness.
