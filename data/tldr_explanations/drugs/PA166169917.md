Midostaurin, a kinase inhibitor effective in treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML), specifically targets mutations in the FLT3 gene, which causes hyperactive signaling and uncontrolled cellular proliferation, thereby influencing the drug's efficacy. The drug is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, notably CYP3A4 and other CYP enzymes, where genetic variability can affect its metabolism, impacting plasma levels and toxicity, although specific dosing guidelines based on these polymorphisms are not yet established.
