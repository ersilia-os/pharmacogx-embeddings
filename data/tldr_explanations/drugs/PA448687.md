Bupropion metabolism is primarily influenced by genetic variations in CYP2B6, particularly CYP2B6*6, which affect enzymatic activity and, consequently, drug levels and patient responses. Additionally, variations in other genes such as CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and DRD2 also modify bupropion's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, impacting treatment efficacy and the risk of adverse effects by affecting neurotransmitter systems and receptor interactions.
