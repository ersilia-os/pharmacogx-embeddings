Rifampicin's interaction with genes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 affects its metabolism, while polymorphisms in SLCO1B1 influence its hepatic uptake, impacting both the efficacy and safety of the drug. Additionally, rifampicin also influences the function of genes such as CYP2B6, ABCB1, and NR1I2, which affects drug transport and metabolism, along with other enzymes involved in detoxification like GSTT1, GSTM1, and NAT2, thereby modifying drug response or the risk of toxicity.
