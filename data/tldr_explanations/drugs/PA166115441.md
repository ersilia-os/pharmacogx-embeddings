Pridopidine, a drug targeting Huntington's Disease by modulating dopaminergic signaling, may interact with genes involved in these pathways, such as DRD2 and HTT. These interactions could potentially influence both the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of pridopidine, affecting its efficacy and how it is processed in the body, although specific pharmacogenetic interactions have not been officially documented yet.
