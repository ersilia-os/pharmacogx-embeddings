The pharmacogenetic profile of testosterone is influenced by interactions with genes such as the androgen receptor (AR), which affects the physiological response to the hormone, and metabolic enzymes like CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP19A1, which play roles in its metabolism and subsequent plasma levels and effects. Additionally, genetic polymorphisms in transport proteins like SHBG and ALB can impact the transport and bioavailability of testosterone, thereby affecting hormone levels and activity.
