Hydromorphone's pharmacogenetic interactions involve its metabolism by UGT2B7, which glucuronidates the drug impacting efficacy and safety, and potential minor metabolic influences by CYP2D6. Additionally, its analgesic effects hinge on the interaction with opioid receptors mediated by OPRM1 gene variants, which can vary individual pain responses and addiction risk, while ABCB1 may affect its distribution by modulating drug efflux at the blood-brain barrier.
