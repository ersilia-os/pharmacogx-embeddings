Hydrocortisone's effectiveness and safety are influenced by interactions with the glucocorticoid receptor gene NR3C1, metabolism by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes, and transport mechanisms involving the ABCB1 gene, with variations in these genes affecting drug exposure and response. Other genes such as SLCO1A2, SLC22A8, SERPINA6, and SHBG also contribute to its pharmacokinetics and systemic availability, but their specific roles are less defined.
