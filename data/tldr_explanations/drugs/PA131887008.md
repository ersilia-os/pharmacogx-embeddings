Variants in the CYP2D6 gene significantly influence the metabolism of MDMA, with ultrarapid metabolizers potentially experiencing diminished psychoactive effects and increased formation of harmful metabolites, while poor metabolizers may see enhanced and prolonged effects. Additional genes like CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and SLC6A2 also contribute to MDMA's metabolic and pharmacodynamic profiles, affecting drug clearance and noradrenaline uptake, though their impacts vary in magnitude compared to CYP2D6.
