Moxifloxacin's metabolism primarily occurs via glucuronide and sulfate conjugation involving the UGT gene family (UGT1A1, UGT1A5, UGT1A9, UGT1A8, UGT1A4, UGT1A3, UGT1A6, UGT1A10), and variants in these genes can affect the drug’s pharmacokinetics such as metabolism and excretion. Additionally, the ABCB1 gene, coding for P-glycoprotein, influences moxifloxacin’s absorption and elimination, while G6PD relates to oxidative stress response, and CYP1A2 has a minor role in its pharmacokinetics.
