Trifluridine's effectiveness and resistance particularly in cancer therapy can be impacted by genetic variations in the enzymes TYMS, TK1, and TYMP which are essential for its activation and function. Additionally, variations in solute carrier transporters, especially SLC29A1, can affect the drug's cellular uptake and distribution, influencing the drug's availability at target sites and potentially altering pharmacokinetics and patient response.
