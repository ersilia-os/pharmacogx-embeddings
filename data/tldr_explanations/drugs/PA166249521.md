Nintedanib's metabolism is significantly influenced by polymorphisms in **UGT1A1**, **UGT1A7**, **UGT1A8**, and **UGT1A10** genes which affect its glucuronidation, and by **ABCB1** and **ABCG2** that alter drug efflux, impacting its pharmacological effects and toxicity. Additionally, **CYP3A4** plays a role, albeit minor, in metabolizing nintedanib, and its genetic variants can also modify the drugâ€™s plasma levels and therapeutic response.
