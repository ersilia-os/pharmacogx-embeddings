Risdiplam functions as an mRNA splicing modifier of the SMN2 gene to alleviate SMN1 deficiency in spinal muscular atrophy, with its therapeutic effectiveness depending on the genetic variability of SMN2 copies. Additionally, its metabolism and efficacy are influenced by genetic polymorphisms in enzymes (FMO1, FMO3, CYP1A1, CYP2J2, CYP3A4, CYP3A7) and transporters (MATE1, MATE2-K, ABCB1, ABCG2), as well as potential variants in the albumin gene ALB, which can affect drug distribution and elimination.
