Diclofenacâ€™s pharmacogenetic interactions mainly involve CYP2C9, CYP2C8, ABCC2, and UGT2B7 genes, regulating its metabolism, excretion, and elimination. Variants in these genes can lead to differences in diclofenac's systemic concentrations and excretion rates, consequently affecting the drug's efficacy and toxicity, notably increasing the risk of side effects such as gastrointestinal issues and liver toxicity.
