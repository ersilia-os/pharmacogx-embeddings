Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) pharmacogenetics is impacted by key metabolic enzymes UGT1A9 and UGT2B7, which influence the levels of its active form, mycophenolic acid (MPA), affecting the drug's efficacy and safety. Transporter genes ABCB1, SLCO1B1, and SLCO1B3, alongside less directly involved CYP enzymes, and pharmacodynamic impacting genes like IMPDH1 and IMPDH2, also affect MMF's plasma concentrations, tissue distribution, and effectiveness in inhibiting immune cell proliferation, vital for personalizing treatment in transplant patients.
