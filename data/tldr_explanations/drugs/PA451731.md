Toremifene's effectiveness and safety are influenced by genetic interactions with CYP3A4, which is pivotal for its metabolism, ABCB1 which affects the drug's distribution and excretion, and ESR1, a receptor gene that defines the drugâ€™s pharmacodynamics by altering its actions in tissues. Genetic variations in these genes can significantly impact the metabolism, bioavailability, and clinical effectiveness of Toremifene in treating breast cancer.
