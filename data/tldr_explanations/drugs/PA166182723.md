Eribulin interacts with the tubulin gene (TUBB1) to disrupt microtubule functions essential for cell division, and with the apoptosis regulator Bcl-2 (BCL2) to enhance apoptosis, contributing to its cancer treatment effectiveness. Although it is minimally metabolized by CYP3A4, genetic variations in the CYP3A4 gene could slightly alter eribulin's pharmacokinetic profile, but are unlikely to significantly affect dosage requirements due to its minimal metabolism by this enzyme.
