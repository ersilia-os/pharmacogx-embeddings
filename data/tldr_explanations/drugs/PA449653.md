Fluconazole inhibits the fungal enzyme ERG11 and interacts with human cytochromes P450 including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, affecting drug metabolism and increasing plasma levels of other drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Genetic variations in these cytochromes and the transporter ABCB1 can alter fluconazole's metabolism, efficacy, and toxicity, impacting therapeutic outcomes.
