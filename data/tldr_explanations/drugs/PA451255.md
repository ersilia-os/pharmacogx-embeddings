Risedronate inhibits the enzyme FDPS in bone cells, impacting osteoclast function and bone resorption; genetic variability in FDPS may alter the drug's effectiveness in inhibiting bone resorption. Variations in the gene PTGS2, involved in prostaglandin synthesis, could affect the drug's secondary effects on inflammation and bone metabolism, potentially influencing its efficacy in conditions like osteoporosis and Paget's disease.
