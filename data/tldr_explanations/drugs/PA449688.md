Fluvastatin's pharmacogenetic interactions involve its metabolism by the CYP2C9 enzyme, with its genetic variants influencing the drug's efficacy and safety by altering metabolism rates, thereby impacting plasma drug levels and potentially increasing the risk of adverse effects such as myopathy. Additionally, polymorphisms in the SLCO1B1 gene, encoding a liver transporter protein, affect fluvastatin's hepatic uptake, influencing its bioavailability and plasma concentrations, which can modify the drugâ€™s toxicity risk.
