The gene CYP2A6 significantly influences the metabolism of 3-hydroxycotinine by affecting the conversion rate of nicotine to cotinine and subsequently to 3-hydroxycotinine, with genetic variations resulting in individuals metabolizing nicotine at different rates. This interaction primarily pertains to pharmacokinetics, as 3-hydroxycotinine does not engage pharmacologically with other targets.
