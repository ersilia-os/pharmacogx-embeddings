Variations in the genes CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, ABCB1, and DRD3 significantly influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of quetiapine by affecting its metabolism, clearance, bioavailability, and response in neurotransmitter pathways. Differences in these genes necessitate personalized quetiapine dosing to optimize therapeutic efficacy and minimize side effects based on individual genetic profiles.
