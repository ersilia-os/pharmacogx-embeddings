Duloxetine's metabolism is significantly regulated by the CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 enzymes, where variations in these genes can lead to different pharmacokinetic outcomes; CYP2D6 affects Duloxetine's plasma levels, influencing its efficacy and side effects in individuals with varying metabolic capacities (poor to ultrarapid metabolizers), while CYP1A2 alterations can modify drug metabolism rates impacting its efficacy and safety. Additionally, the ABCB1 gene, by affecting cellular uptake and distribution, can also influence the pharmacokinetics of Duloxetine, further affecting drug exposure and therapeutic outcomes.
