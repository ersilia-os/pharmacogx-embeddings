Carbocisteine is metabolized by enzymes CDO1 and PAH, where CDO1 helps in catabolizing cysteine and PAH in hydroxylating phenylalanine, both essential for the drug's breakdown and efficacy. Another gene, ST3GAL5, affects the drug's functionality by altering glycoprotein content in mucus, with genetic variations in these genes impacting the metabolic process and the balance of sialomucins and fucomucins in mucus, thus influencing the effectiveness of carbocisteine as a mucolytic.
