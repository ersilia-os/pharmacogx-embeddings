Dasatinib's pharmacogenetic interactions are influenced primarily by the CYP3A4 enzyme, which metabolizes the drug, affecting its plasma levels and thus impacting both efficacy and toxicity. Additionally, transporter genes like ABCB1 and ABCG2 regulate dasatinib's efflux from cells, altering bioavailability and distribution, while genetic variations in the pharmacodynamic target gene ABL1 and related kinases can also affect treatment response and clinical outcomes.
