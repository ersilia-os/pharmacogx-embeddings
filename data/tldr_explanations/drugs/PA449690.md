Fluvoxamine, an SSRI, is metabolized by enzymes such as CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4, where genetic variations can impact its pharmacokinetics, influencing patient responses in terms of efficacy and side effects. Pharmacodynamically, genetic polymorphisms in SLC6A4 affect its effectiveness in enhancing serotonin activity, crucial for its antidepressant action, and variations in KCNH2 could impact cardiological side effects.
