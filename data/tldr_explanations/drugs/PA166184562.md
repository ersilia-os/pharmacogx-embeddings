Tafamidis treats transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis by binding to the tetrameric form of the transthyretin protein, which is encoded by the TTR gene, preventing its dissociation into disease-causing monomers. The drug's pharmacokinetics involve interactions with the ABCG2, SLC22A6, and SLC22A8 genes, which encode transport proteins affecting its excretion and bioavailability, hence influencing its plasma levels and overall efficacy and safety.
