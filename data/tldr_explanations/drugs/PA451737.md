Genetic variations in CES1 affect the metabolism of trandolapril to its active form, trandolaprilat, impacting the drug's efficacy and safety by altering the available drug levels. Simultaneously, variations in the ACE gene influence trandolaprilâ€™s ability to inhibit ACE and reduce blood pressure by modifying the enzyme's expression or activity, crucial for understanding individual drug responses and potential adverse effects.
