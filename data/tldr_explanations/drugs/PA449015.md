Genetic variations in CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 significantly influence the pharmacokinetics of citalopram by affecting the drug's plasma levels and dosing requirements respectively. In terms of pharmacodynamics, polymorphisms in genes like SLC6A4, GSK3B, BDNF, ABCB1, HTR2A, and HTR1A modulate the drugâ€™s efficacy and side effect profile by altering its brain availability, antidepressant effects, and interactions with serotonin receptors.
