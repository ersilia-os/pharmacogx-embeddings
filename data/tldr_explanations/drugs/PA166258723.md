Tenofovir alafenamide's activation into its pharmacologically active form, tenofovir diphosphate, relies on CTSA and CES1, with CES1 variants affecting the rate of this activation and consequently the drug's efficacy and safety. Additionally, the drug's bioavailability and systemic exposure are significantly influenced by transporters like ABCB1, ABCC4, SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, and SLC22A6, where genetic variants in these transporters can alter drug plasma levels, impacting therapeutic outcomes and side effect profiles.
