Erythromycin metabolism is significantly influenced by genetic variations in the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes, affecting drug efficacy and risk of toxicity. Additionally, transporter genes such as SLCO1B1 and ABCB1, which regulate drug absorption, distribution, and efflux in various tissues, along with ABCC2 which is involved in drug excretion, also play crucial roles in the pharmacokinetics of erythromycin, influencing its levels and side effects.
