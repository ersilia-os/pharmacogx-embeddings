Arformoterol, targeting the ADRB2 gene, is metabolized primarily through glucuronidation and to a lesser extent by cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. Genetic variations in these metabolic enzymes can significantly impact the drug's plasma levels, efficacy, and side-effect profiles, making personalized dosing essential for optimal therapeutic outcomes in COPD management.
