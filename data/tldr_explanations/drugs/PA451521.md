Succimer functions by forming complexes with heavy metals through its chemical properties, without direct interactions with biological targets like enzymes or receptors. Although there is limited pharmacogenetic data regarding succimer, one relevant gene, G6PD, may influence treatment outcomes as its deficiency can exacerbate oxidative stress during chelation, potentially impacting patients with G6PD deficiency who undergo therapy with succimer.
