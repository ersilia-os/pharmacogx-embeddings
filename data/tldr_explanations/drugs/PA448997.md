Cidofovir's effectiveness and safety are influenced by genetic variations in the TYMP enzyme, which affects the drug's activation or degradation, and in the SLC22A6 transporter, which modulates its renal clearance and toxicity. These genetic factors impact cidofovir's pharmacokinetics, altering both its therapeutic effectiveness and nephrotoxic risk in individuals.
