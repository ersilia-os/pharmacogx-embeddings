Genetic variations in the PPARG gene, which codes for the PPAR-gamma receptor, can influence the pharmacodynamics of sipoglitazar, impacting its efficacy and safety profiles in treating conditions like type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Such polymorphisms might affect the therapeutic response by altering gene expression levels and consequentially metabolic outcomes related to the drug's action as a dual agonist of PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma.
