Eltrombopag metabolism involves CYP1A2, CYP2C8, UGT1A1, UGT1A3, and UGT1A9 enzymes, where polymorphisms, particularly in UGT1A1, could impact the drug's clearance and overall exposure. Additionally, genes like SLCO1B1 and ABCG2 affect eltrombopag's absorption and distribution, while genetic variants in F5 and SERPINC1, specifically rs6025 in F5 and rs121909567 in SERPINC1, are linked to an increased risk of thromboembolic events, highlighting the significant role of these genetic interactions in the drugâ€™s pharmacodynamics and safety profiles.
