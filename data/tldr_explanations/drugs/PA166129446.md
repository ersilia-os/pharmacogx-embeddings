The genes CYP3A4 and SLCO1B1 are central to the pharmacogenetics of simvastatin, influencing its metabolism and transport. Variants in CYP3A4 affect the conversion of simvastatin to its active form, simvastatin acid, thereby altering drug efficacy, while polymorphisms in SLCO1B1 can modify hepatic uptake and increase the risk of adverse effects such as myopathy by affecting the plasma levels of simvastatin acid.
