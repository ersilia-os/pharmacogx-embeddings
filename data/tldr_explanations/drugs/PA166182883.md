The metabolism of ospemifene is significantly influenced by polymorphisms in several cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6, which affect the drugâ€™s pharmacokinetics and individual responses. Genetic variations in these enzymes can lead to different metabolizing phenotypes from poor to extensive, impacting ospemifene's plasma levels, efficacy, and safety, thus underscoring the importance of genetic considerations in its clinical use.
