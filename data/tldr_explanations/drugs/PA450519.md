Variants in transporter genes SLC22A6 and SLC22A7 can affect the absorption and elimination of Minocycline, altering its plasma levels and effects. Additionally, genetic changes in pharmacodynamic genes like IL1B, ALOX5, MMP9, and MAPK pathway genes (MAPK1, MAPK3, MAPK8) may influence individual responses to Minocycline by affecting inflammatory and apoptotic processes, potentially altering the drugâ€™s efficacy and safety.
