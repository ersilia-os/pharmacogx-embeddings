Variations in the gene encoding Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) affect the metabolism of didanosine, altering its antiviral efficacy and toxicity by influencing intracellular concentrations of its active metabolites. Similarly, genetic variability in transport proteins such as SLC29A1 and SLC29A2 impacts didanosine's absorption and distribution, thereby modifying its therapeutic outcomes by altering bioavailability and intracellular levels.
