Moclobemide, a selective reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), is affected by genetic variations in the MAOA and MAOB genes, which can influence the drug's effectiveness by impacting neurotransmitter levels and monoamine catabolism. Additionally, its metabolism is influenced by polymorphisms in CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, affecting the drugâ€™s bioavailability and necessitating dosage adjustments to optimize safety and efficacy based on different metabolizer statuses ranging from poor to ultra-rapid.
