The pharmacogenetics of ribavirin are influenced by genes like IFNL3, ADK, NT5C2, SLC28A3, SLC29A1, and IMPDH2, which govern how it is metabolized, transported, and modulates the host's immune system response. Specifically, IFNL3 affects therapeutic outcomes through different variants such as rs12979860, while ADK and NT5C2 are involved in its metabolism outside the cytochrome P450 system, and IMPDH2 is essential in its target pathway, affecting ribavirin's efficacy and side effects like anemia.
