Panobinostat's effectiveness and safety are influenced by its interaction with CYP2D6, CYP2C19, affecting its metabolism, and ABCB1, which alters its distribution and excretion. Variants in these genes can significantly modify drug plasma levels, consequently impacting therapeutic efficacy and potential toxicity, with differing effects observed in individuals with poor or rapid metabolizer phenotypes.
