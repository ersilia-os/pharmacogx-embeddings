Lofexidine, a medication used for opioid withdrawal, is significantly affected by the CYP2D6 enzyme due to genetic polymorphisms that alter drug metabolism. Poor metabolizers, with lower CYP2D6 activity, may face increased risk of adverse effects due to higher drug concentration in the plasma, whereas rapid metabolizers may see reduced effectiveness due to lower drug levels, underscoring the need to tailor dosing based on individual genetic profiles to optimize efficacy and minimize side effects.
