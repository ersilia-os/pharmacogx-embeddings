The efficacy and safety of tacrolimus, an immunosuppressant, are significantly influenced by pharmacogenetic interactions involving several genes. Primarily, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 impact its hepatic metabolism, determining dosing requirements, while ABCB1 affects tacrolimus absorption and efflux, influencing drug levels and potential adverse effects. Additional genes like CYP2C8, CYP2C19, POR, NR1I2, and SLCO1B1 also play roles in its pharmacokinetics by affecting metabolism, expression of metabolism-related genes, and drug distribution and elimination.
