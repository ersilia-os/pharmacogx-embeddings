The metabolism of aripiprazole, the active drug released from its prodrug aripiprazole lauroxil, is significantly influenced by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, with genetic variations in CYP2D6 playing a predominant role in determining the drug's plasma levels, efficacy, and side effect profile. This variability in metabolism due to genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6 can lead to diverse therapeutic outcomes, necessitating tailored dosing based on the patient's specific genotype to optimize treatment efficacy and minimize adverse effects.
