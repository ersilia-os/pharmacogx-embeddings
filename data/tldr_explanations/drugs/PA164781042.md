Genetic variants in the CYP3A4 gene can significantly influence the metabolism of flucloxacillin, affecting its efficacy and adverse effects due to variations in drug plasma levels. Additionally, variations in the ABCB11 gene affect the transport and clearance of flucloxacillin, which can modify its pharmacokinetics, while specific HLA alleles like HLA-B*57:01 are linked to hypersensitivity reactions, impacting the drug's pharmacodynamics and overall clinical outcomes.
