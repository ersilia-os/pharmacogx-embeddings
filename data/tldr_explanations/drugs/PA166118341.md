Vandetanib's interaction with key genes like CYP3A4, ABCB1, SLC22A2, RET, EGFR, and VEGFR influences its metabolism, absorption, and anti-tumor effects, affecting drug efficacy and toxicity. Genetic variations in these genes can lead to differences in how patients metabolize the drug, respond to treatment, and experience side effects, making tailored therapy based on these genetic profiles critical for optimizing treatment outcomes.
