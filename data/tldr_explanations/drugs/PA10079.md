Variations in the ADRB2 gene, which encodes for the beta-2 adrenergic receptor, significantly affect the efficacy and safety of Fenoterol, a drug used for bronchodilation. Specific polymorphisms in ADRB2 can alter the receptor's structure or function, leading to differences in how patients respond to the drug, including changes in receptor sensitivity and regulation, which impacts clinical outcomes such as the effectiveness of bronchodilation and severity of side effects.
