Odevixibat interacts pharmacogenetically with proteins like the ileal sodium/bile acid cotransporter (SLC10A2) and P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), where SLC10A2 facilitates bile acid reabsorption and its inhibition by odevixibat is key to treating pruritus in PFIC. Variations in SLC10A2 and ABCB1 genes can affect the drug's efficacy and pharmacokinetics, respectively, influencing odevixibat's absorption, distribution, and overall effectiveness, necessitating potential dosing adjustments.
