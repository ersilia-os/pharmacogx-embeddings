Erlotinib, an EGFR-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has its efficacy and metabolism influenced by genetic variations in the EGFR, CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP1A1, ABCG2, and ABCB1 genes. These genetic factors affect drug response, clearance, toxicity, absorption, and efflux, making molecular profiling essential for tailoring personalized cancer therapies to optimize outcomes and minimize adverse effects.
