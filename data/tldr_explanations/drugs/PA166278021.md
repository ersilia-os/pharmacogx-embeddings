Mitapivat interacts pharmacogenetically with genetic variants in PKLR, its direct enzymatic target, affecting therapeutic efficacy due to differential enzyme activation. Furthermore, variations in genes such as CYP3A4, which influences mitapivat's metabolism and clearance, as well as other cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP19A1, and the transporter gene ABCB1, impact its pharmacokinetics, effectiveness, and potential drug-related outcomes like bone density effects, necessitating personalized dosage adjustments.
