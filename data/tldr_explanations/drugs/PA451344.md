Sibutramine's metabolism through the CYP3A4 enzyme leads to the production of active metabolites M1 and M2, which inhibit the reuptake of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine by interacting with their respective transporters (SLC6A4, SLC6A2, SLC6A3). Additionally, genetic variations in genes like GNB3 may affect the drugâ€™s efficacy in weight loss, indicating a role in differential patient responses to sibutramine treatment in obesity management.
