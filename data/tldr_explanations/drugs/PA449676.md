Fluphenazine's interactions are influenced by the CYP2D6 gene, which impacts its metabolism and plasma concentration, leading to variations in drug exposure that can cause increased adverse effects or reduced efficacy depending on the individual's metabolic rate. Additionally, genetic differences in DRD2 and ABCB1 affect fluphenazineâ€™s binding affinity to dopamine receptors and its penetration through the blood-brain barrier, respectively, which alters therapeutic outcomes and side effects.
