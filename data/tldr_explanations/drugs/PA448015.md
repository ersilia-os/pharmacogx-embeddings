Acetaminophen metabolism in the liver is significantly affected by genetic variations in enzymes such as CYP2E1, which metabolizes the drug into its toxic metabolite NAPQI; GSTP1 and GSTM1, which help detoxify NAPQI; and UGT enzymes like UGT2B15 and UGT1A6, which are involved in its glucuronidation. Additionally, polymorphisms in SULT1A1 and SULT1A3 can influence the sulfation of acetaminophen, thereby impacting drug clearance and systemic exposure, which are crucial in determining the risk and severity of hepatotoxicity, especially during overdose.
