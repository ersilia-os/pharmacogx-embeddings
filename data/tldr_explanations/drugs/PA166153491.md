Brivaracetam's metabolism is highly influenced by genetic variants in CYP enzymes such as CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP2B6, and CYP2C9, with CYP2C19 playing a pivotal role. Variants in CYP2C19 can lead to different metabolizer phenotypes, causing variable drug plasma concentrations and impacting the efficacy and safety of brivaracetam, suggesting that personalized dosing may be necessary to optimize treatment outcomes.
