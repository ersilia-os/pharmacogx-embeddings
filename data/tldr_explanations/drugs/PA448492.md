Asparaginase, used in treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia, does not interact directly through typical drug-metabolizing enzymes, but genetic predispositions, particularly from genes like HLA-DRB1, MTHFR, SOD2, GATA3, and NFATC2, influence its therapeutic outcomes and hypersensitivity reactions. These genes, related to immune responses and metabolic pathways, might affect the drugâ€™s efficacy and toxicity, suggesting that genetic variations could impact treatment results, though direct gene-drug interactions are speculative.
