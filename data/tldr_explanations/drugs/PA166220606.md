Bazedoxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), interacts with estrogen receptors ESR1 and ESR2, and its metabolism is primarily through glucuronidation by UGT enzymes, notably UGT1A4, UGT1A8, and UGT1A10. Variations in these UGT genes affect the drug's metabolism rate, influencing its effectiveness, safety, and individualized therapeutic outcomes in treating menopausal symptoms and preventing postmenopausal osteoporosis.
