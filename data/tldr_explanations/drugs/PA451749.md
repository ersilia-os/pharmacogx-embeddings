Triamcinolone, a synthetic corticosteroid, functions by binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) to diminish pro-inflammatory cytokines and its metabolism is primarily mediated by CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 enzymes. Genetic variations in these enzymes, as well as in carrier proteins like SERPINA6 and ALB, influence the drug's clearance, plasma concentration, distribution, and bioavailability, thereby affecting therapeutic efficacy and side effect profiles.
