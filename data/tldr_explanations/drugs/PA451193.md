Pyrimethamine's pharmacogenetic interactions involve the enzyme CYP2C8, which affects its metabolism, and the transporters SLC47A1 and SLC47A2, which impact its transport; polymorphisms in these genes can alter the drug's efficacy and toxicity, necessitating possible dosing adjustments. Additionally, gene variants in G6PD and IKBKG could influence treatment responses and risk profiles in certain parasitic infections through their roles in cellular processes and immune responses.
