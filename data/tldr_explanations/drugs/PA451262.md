Rivastigmine's effectiveness in managing dementia symptoms in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease is predominantly influenced by its interactions with the ACHE and BCHE genes, which encode acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, enzymes vital in acetylcholine metabolism. Genetic variations in these genes can alter acetylcholine hydrolysis rates, impacting the drug's efficacy and safety by influencing the availability of acetylcholine in the brain.
