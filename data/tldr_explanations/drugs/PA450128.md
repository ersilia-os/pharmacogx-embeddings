Variability in the CYP3A4 gene affects the metabolism rate of isotretinoin, a vitamin A derivative, influencing its systemic concentrations which could alter therapeutic and adverse effects such as teratogenicity or hyperlipidemia. Additionally, gene variants in RARA and RARG, encoding retinoic acid receptors, could impact isotretinoin's effectiveness in activating these receptors, thus affecting clinical responses and skin-related side effects like differentiation and apoptosis of skin cells.
