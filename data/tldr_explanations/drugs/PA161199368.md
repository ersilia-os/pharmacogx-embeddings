Iloperidone metabolism is heavily influenced by variations in the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 genes, impacting drug efficacy and side effects due to differences in plasma levels and metabolic clearance. Additionally, genetic variations in receptor-related genes like HTR2C may influence iloperidone's pharmacodynamic interactions, affecting how the drug interacts with dopamine and serotonin receptors, which can also alter its efficacy and side effect profile.
