Pitolisant's metabolism is largely impacted by the CYP2D6 enzyme, with variations in this gene affecting drug plasma levels and patient response due to genetic polymorphisms. Additional enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2B6 also metabolize pitolisant, contributing further to the complexity of its pharmacogenetic interactions that influence individual drug efficacy and side effects.
