Fosphenytoin's metabolism into phenytoin is mainly facilitated by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 enzymes; variants in these genes can significantly influence metabolic rates and plasma levels of phenytoin, impacting drug efficacy and risk of toxicity. Genetic variations like CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles (*2, *3) decrease metabolism, necessitating genotype-guided dosing for optimal therapeutic outcomes, while other genes such as HLA-B may influence hypersensitivity reactions to the drug.
