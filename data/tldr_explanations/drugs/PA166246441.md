Sotorasib targets the mutant KRAS G12C in certain cancers, impacting the MAP kinase signaling pathway pharmacodynamically due to the dependence of its therapeutic effect on the presence of this mutation. On the pharmacokinetic side, its metabolism involves several CYP enzymes (like CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2B6) and transporters (ABCG2 and ABCB1), where genetic variants can affect drug plasma levels, influencing both efficacy and toxicity, potentially necessitating dose adjustments.
