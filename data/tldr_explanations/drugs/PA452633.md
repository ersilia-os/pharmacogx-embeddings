Genetic variants in the UGT2B7 gene can influence the metabolism of morphine into Morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G), altering its plasma levels and impacting its analgesic effectiveness and side effects like respiratory depression. Additionally, variations in opioid receptor genes (OPRM1, OPRD1, OPRK1) can modify how M6G interacts with these receptors, affecting the drugâ€™s efficacy and tolerance by altering receptor binding affinity and signaling pathways.
