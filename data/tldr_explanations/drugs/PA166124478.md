The gene CYP2D6 plays a crucial role in the metabolism of endoxifen, an active metabolite of tamoxifen used in ER+ breast cancer therapy. Variations in the CYP2D6 gene affect the plasma levels and therapeutic effectiveness of endoxifen, with different alleles like CYP2D6*4 or CYP2D6*5 impacting patients' responses to treatment by altering metabolizer phenotypes, leading to either reduced or elevated drug levels in the body.
