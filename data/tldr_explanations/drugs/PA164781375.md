The interaction of Ibritumomab tiuxetan with the CD20 antigen, determined by the MS4A1 gene, facilitates its use in treating non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by targeting and destroying B-cells with a radioactive isotope. Variations in the MS4A1 gene can influence the expression and structure of CD20, potentially affecting the drug's binding affinity and therapeutic efficacy.
