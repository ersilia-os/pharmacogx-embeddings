Genetic variations in the metabolic enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 influence the metabolism of Troglitazone, affecting its plasma levels, efficacy, and safety, while variants in pharmacodynamic gene PPARG and transporters ABCB11 and SLCO1B1 can impact responses related to insulin sensitivity, glucose regulation, and increase the risk of hepatotoxicity by modifying hepatic exposure.
