Variants in the CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 genes can affect the metabolism of escitalopram, leading to differences in drug efficacy and the likelihood of side effects. Additionally, polymorphisms in ABCB1, which influences drug distribution, and SLC6A4, which affects the function of the targeted serotonin transporter, can alter drug exposure and response, further influencing the pharmacodynamic outcomes of escitalopram treatment.
