Variations in the ABCB1 gene, which encodes P-glycoprotein, significantly impact the pharmacokinetics of the factor Xa inhibitor edoxaban by affecting its absorption and plasma levels due to altered efflux across the intestinal barrier. While edoxaban undergoes minor metabolism via CYP3A4, its effects on edoxaban are not considered a significant pharmacogenetic interaction, highlighting ABCB1 as the predominant gene influencing edoxaban's pharmacokinetic profile.
