The MT-RNR1 gene, which encodes mitochondrial 12S rRNA, is associated with increased susceptibility to aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity, influencing mitochondrial function in cochlear hair cells and heightening their vulnerability to damage from drugs like streptomycin. Additionally, the HLA-A gene, involved in immune responses, could potentially influence sensitivity to drug-induced tissue damage, although its direct role in interaction with streptomycin is less evident.
