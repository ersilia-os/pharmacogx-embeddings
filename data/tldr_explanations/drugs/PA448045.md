Acyclovir's effectiveness as an antiviral drug is influenced by genetic variations in several cellular enzymes involved in its activation and metabolism. The drug is initially activated by viral thymidine kinase and further phosphorylated by human enzymes such as guanylate kinase and creatine kinase, with genetic variants in these enzymes potentially altering the drug's efficacy. Additionally, genetic variations in renal transporters like SLC22A1, SLC22A6, and SLC22A8 could affect acyclovirâ€™s clearance, thereby impacting drug levels and toxicity risk.
