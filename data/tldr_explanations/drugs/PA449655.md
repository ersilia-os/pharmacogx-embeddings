The efficacy and toxicity of fludarabine, a chemotherapeutic drug, are influenced by genetic interactions, particularly involving the deoxycytidine kinase gene (DCK), which activates fludarabine to its effective form, and the solute carrier family genes SLC29A1 and SLC28A3, which affect the drugâ€™s cellular uptake. Variations in these genes can impact the drug's pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, affecting both the drug's availability and its successful therapeutic outcomes in patients, especially those with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
