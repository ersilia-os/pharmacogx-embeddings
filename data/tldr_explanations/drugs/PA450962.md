The efficacy and plasma levels of pilocarpine, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist used in treating xerostomia and glaucoma, are influenced by genetic polymorphisms in CYP2A6, an enzyme responsible for its metabolism. Variants in CYP2A6 can lead to differing drug actions, where reduced activity can cause higher plasma concentrations and possibly more adverse effects, whereas increased enzyme activity might necessitate higher drug doses for effectiveness. Additional influence on pilocarpineâ€™s metabolism is seen with PON1, though its pharmacogenetic impact is less defined.
