Tolperisone is metabolized by the CYP1A2 enzyme, and genetic variations in the CYP1A2 gene affect its metabolism, influencing the drug's efficacy and safety which may require dose adjustments. While CYP2D6 was mentioned, its significant role in the metabolism of Tolperisone is not clearly supported, highlighting a potential error unless further verified by specific studies.
