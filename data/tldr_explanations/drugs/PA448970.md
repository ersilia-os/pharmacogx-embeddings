Chlorthalidone's effectiveness in managing hypertension can be influenced by genetic variants in SLC12A1, affecting sodium and chloride reabsorption in renal distal convoluted tubules which impacts the drug's pharmacodynamics. Additionally, variations in ALB could alter Chlorthalidone's binding and transport, affecting its pharmacokinetics and modifying dosage requirements and effectiveness in individual patients.
