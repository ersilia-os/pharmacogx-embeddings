Thioguanine, used in treating acute myeloid leukemia, is metabolized into active metabolites primarily through the purine salvage pathway, with TPMT and NUDT15 genetic variants influencing the drug's metabolism and toxicity. Variants in TPMT can reduce enzyme activity and increase toxicity risks, while NUDT15 variants similarly affect thioguanine's toxicity profile, underlining the importance of genetic testing before treatment to adjust dosages and minimize toxicities.
