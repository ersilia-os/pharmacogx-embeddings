Isoprenaline's pharmacodynamics are influenced by its interaction with ADRB1, ADRB2, and ADRB3 genes, which encode for beta-1, beta-2, and beta-3 adrenergic receptors, affecting clinical responses such as heart rate changes and bronchodilation. Pharmacokinetically, COMT, CYP1A1, and CYP1B1 are significant as they metabolize isoprenaline, with genetic variations in these enzymes potentially affecting the drug's clearance, efficacy, and safety.
