Cangrelor directly inhibits the P2Y12 receptor, and its effectiveness or safety may be influenced by genetic variants in the P2RY12 gene that encode this receptor. Variations in P2RY12 could affect the receptorâ€™s binding affinity or expression levels, potentially altering cangrelor's antiplatelet effect.
