Furosemide's effectiveness and safety are influenced by genetic variations in SLC12A1, which regulates sodium and chloride reabsorption in the kidneys, directly affecting the drug's mechanism of action. Additionally, genes such as UGT1A1, SLC22A6, and SLC22A8 impact its metabolism and excretion, altering furosemide's clearance and plasma levels, while CYP4F2, CYP11B2, and SCNN1G indirectly influence its pharmacodynamic properties. Understanding these genetic interactions can help tailor individualized dosing and therapeutic strategies to optimize treatment outcomes.
