Variations in esterase-related genes may impact the hydrolysis of valganciclovir, a prodrug of ganciclovir, while genetic variability in solute carrier genes SLC15A1, SLC15A2, and SLC6A14 can influence its absorption and bioavailability. Additionally, gene variants in ABCB1 and ABCC4, involved in drug transport and efflux, may alter the distribution and elimination of ganciclovir, potentially affecting the drug's effectiveness and toxicity profile.
