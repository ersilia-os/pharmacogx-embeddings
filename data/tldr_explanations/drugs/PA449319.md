The ABCB1 gene, which encodes P-glycoprotein, plays a crucial role in the pharmacokinetics of digoxin by affecting its absorption, distribution, and excretion, with polymorphisms in this gene altering transporter activity and thus impacting digoxin plasma levels, efficacy, and toxicity. Other genes such as ADRB1, ADRB2, ACE, NOS1AP, and NOS3 might influence pharmacodynamic interactions by affecting cardiac response and myocardial ion handling, central to digoxin's mechanism of action through ATP1A1 inhibition.
