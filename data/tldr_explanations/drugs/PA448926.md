Chlorambucil's metabolism is influenced by polymorphisms in the glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) enzymes such as GSTP1, GSTA1, GSTA2, GSTM1, GSTM2, GSTM3, GSTM4, GSTM5, GSTT1, GSTT2, and GSTT2B, which are involved in the drug's detoxification through glutathione conjugation. Variations or deletions in genes like GSTM1 and GSTT1 can lead to reduced enzyme activity, impacting drug toxicity and efficacy, while SLCO1A2 variants affect the drugâ€™s pharmacokinetic profile by altering its distribution and elimination.
