Genetic variants in key transport proteins like OAT1 (SLC22A6) and OAT3 (SLC22A8) can significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), influencing drug clearance and potentially leading to differences in drug levels and toxicity, such as nephrotoxicity. Additionally, interactions with other genes such as ABCC2, ABCC4, CYP27B1, CYP24A1, and SLC28A2 may impact TDF's disposition, effectiveness, and side effects, including its bone toxicity and intracellular activation, which are crucial for tailoring effective and safe therapy for treating HIV and hepatitis B.
