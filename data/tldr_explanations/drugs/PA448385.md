Amitriptyline’s metabolism and effect are significantly influenced by genetic variations in CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, which alter its enzymatic breakdown, and ABCB1, which affects its distribution across the blood-brain barrier. Poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 may have increased drug levels leading to a higher risk of adverse effects, while variations in CYP2C19 and ABCB1 can impact the drug’s efficacy and side-effect profile by affecting metabolic rate and drug transport, respectively.
