Genetic variations in the CYP2C9 enzyme can minimally impact the metabolism of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic levofloxacin, while variants in ABCB1, coding for P-glycoprotein, can affect the drugâ€™s cellular efflux, impacting its concentration in target tissues, thus influencing efficacy and safety. Furthermore, genes such as SLC22A1, SLC22A2, SLC22A4, SLCO1A2, and SLCO4C1, which are involved in renal secretion and organic anion transport, may also influence levofloxacin's excretion and overall pharmacokinetics.
