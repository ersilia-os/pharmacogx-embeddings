The pharmacogenetics of idarubicin involve several genes including CYP2C9 and CYP2D6, which affect the drugâ€™s metabolism and pharmacokinetics, and TOP2A, the target gene of idarubicin that impacts DNA processes and apoptosis. Other significant genes like ABCC1, CBR3, ADH1A, SLCO1B1, ABCB1, NQO1, and DCK influence the drug's absorption, distribution, metabolic pathways, and resistance, playing a crucial role in determining individual treatment efficacy and adverse effects associated with idarubicin.
