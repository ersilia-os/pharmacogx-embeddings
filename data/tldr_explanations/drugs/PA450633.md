Nimodipine's effectiveness and safety are influenced by its interaction with pharmacogenetic components such as the CYP3A5 gene and the CACNA1C gene. Genetic variations in CYP3A5 can affect the metabolism rate of nimodipine, leading to alterations in drug concentration and potential side effects, while variants in CACNA1C can affect the sensitivity of calcium channels to nimodipine, impacting its therapeutic efficacy in treating cerebral vasospasm.
