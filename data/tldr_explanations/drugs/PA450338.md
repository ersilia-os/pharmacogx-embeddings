The metabolism of meclizine, an antihistamine for motion sickness and vertigo, is mediated by the CYP2D6 enzyme, whose genetic variants can affect the drug's pharmacokinetics. Depending on whether someone is a poor, intermediate, extensive, or ultrarapid metabolizer, as categorized by CYP2D6 gene variants, the dosage of meclizine might need adjustment to avoid inadequate treatment or adverse effects due to altered plasma concentrations.
