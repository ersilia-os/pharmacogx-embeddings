The pharmacogenetic interactions of voxilaprevir are primarily influenced by its metabolism and transport involving genes such as CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP1A2, ABCB1, ABCG2, SLCO1B1, and SLCO1B3. Variations in these enzymes and transporters affect the metabolic rate and pharmacokinetics of voxilaprevir, altering drug plasma levels, concentration in the body, and impacting efficacy and toxicity.
