Valbenazine targets the SLC18A2 gene and is metabolized by enzymes CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2D6; variations in these genes affect the drugâ€™s metabolism, efficacy, and safety. Differences in gene activity can lead to variable patient responses and, specifically, altered activity of CYP2D6 can increase the risk of QT prolongation.
