The pharmacogenetic profile of piroxicam is significantly influenced by its interactions with CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 genes, which are vital in its metabolism. Polymorphisms in CYP2C9 can lead to altered metabolic clearance, resulting in higher drug levels and an increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects. While CYP2C8 also plays a role in metabolism, transporter proteins like SLC22A6, SLC22A8, and SLCO2B1 impact the renal excretion of piroxicam, affecting drug accumulation and elimination.
