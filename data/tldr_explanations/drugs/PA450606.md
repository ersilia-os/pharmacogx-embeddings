Nelfinavir, an HIV-1 protease inhibitor, is metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2C19, with genetic variants in these enzymes affecting its plasma concentration and efficacy. Additionally, the ABCB1 efflux transporter influences nelfinavir's cellular uptake and distribution, which can alter drug concentrations at target sites and impact therapeutic outcomes. Understanding these gene-drug interactions is key for individualizing dosages to optimize treatment efficacy and minimize toxicity.
