The pharmacogenetic profile of Letermovir involves significant interactions with UGT1A1, which is pivotal in its minor metabolic pathways affecting drug clearance and efficacy, and SLCO1B1, which affects the hepatic uptake and bioavailability of the drug through its genetic variants such as UGT1A1*28 and SLCO1B1*5. These gene-drug interactions highlight the impact of individual genetic variability on the pharmacokinetics, effectiveness, and tolerability of Letermovir, emphasizing the importance of personalized dosing strategies.
