The pharmacogenetic interactions of agomelatine are significantly influenced by its metabolism through cytochrome P450 enzymes, especially CYP1A2 and to a lesser extent CYP2C9. Genetic variants in CYP1A2 can greatly affect agomelatine's metabolic clearance, leading to either elevated plasma levels that increase the risk of adverse effects, such as hepatotoxicity or severe depression, or decreased drug concentrations that might result in insufficient therapeutic effects; similarly, variations in CYP2C9 could also modify drug levels and response.
