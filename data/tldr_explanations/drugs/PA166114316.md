Sodium phenylbutyrate transforms into phenylacetate, which binds to glutamine to promote ammonia excretion; genetic variations in urea cycle enzymes like OTC, ASS1, and CPS1, important in ammonia metabolism, can affect individual responses to this treatment due to differences in nitrogen processing rates. These pharmacogenetic correlations are inferred from the metabolic roles of these enzymes rather than direct drug interactions, indicating that individual metabolic capacities are crucial in optimizing treatment effectiveness.
