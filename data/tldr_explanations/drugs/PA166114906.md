The metabolism of bosutinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used for treating chronic myelogenous leukemia, is significantly influenced by the CYP3A4 gene, where variants like CYP3A4*22 can lead to increased plasma drug concentrations and higher toxicity risk. Additionally, the ABCB1 gene, encoding P-glycoprotein, impacts bosutinib's absorption and distribution, also affecting the drug's efficacy and side effects due to alterations in pharmacokinetics.
