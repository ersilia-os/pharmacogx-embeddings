The pharmacogenetic interactions of noroxycodone, derived from oxycodone, are significantly influenced by the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Variations in the activity of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, due to genetic polymorphisms, alter the metabolism rate of noroxycodone, impacting its plasma concentrations and thus affecting its efficacy, safety, and potential side effects in individuals.
