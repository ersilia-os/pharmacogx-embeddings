Nilotinib, a drug used for chronic myeloid leukemia, primarily inhibits ABL1 and KIT, while its pharmacokinetics are influenced by metabolic enzymes CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP2B6, and transport proteins ABCB1 and ABCG2. Additionally, polymorphisms in the UGT1A1 gene, especially the UGT1A1*28 allele, can predispose patients to hyperbilirubinemia, affecting the drug's conjugation process and highlighting the need for personalized dosing based on individual genetic profiles.
