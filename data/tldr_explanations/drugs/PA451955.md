The pharmacogenetics of zileuton are significantly influenced by genes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which are critical in the drug's hepatic metabolism and notably affect its clearance and plasma concentrations. Variants in these genes can alter enzyme activity, impacting the drug's efficacy and safety, with certain variants potentially necessitating dose adjustments. Additionally, zileuton acts pharmacodynamically by selectively inhibiting ALOX5, preventing the formation of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes, thereby contributing to its anti-inflammatory effects in treating asthma. Although variability in ALOX5 might hypothetically affect drug effectiveness, such associations are not well-established.
