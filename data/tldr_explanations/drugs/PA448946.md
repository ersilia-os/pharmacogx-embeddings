The metabolism of chloroprocaine is chiefly influenced by the BCHE gene, where genetic variations can affect the drugâ€™s metabolic rate, impacting its clearance and duration of action, potentially leading to prolonged effects and increased toxicity in individuals with decreased BCHE activity. Additionally, genes such as CYB5R3 and G6PD also affect chloroprocaine's response, with CYB5R3 influencing drug metabolism through electron transfer processes, and G6PD deficiencies increasing oxidative stress risks, which may affect recovery post-anesthesia.
