Tiludronate, a drug used to treat bone conditions like Paget's disease, impacts osteoclast function and survival by targeting tyrosine-protein phosphatases (PTPN12, PTPN6, PTPRE) and inhibiting subunits of the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase, e.g., ATP6V0A1 and ATP6V0A2), which are essential for osteoclast attachment to bone and bone resorption. Genetic variations in these protein-coding genes could potentially affect the drug's efficacy and safety, although clear pharmacogenetic correlations have yet to be conclusively documented in clinical settings.
