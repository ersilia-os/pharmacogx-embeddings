Etoposide's pharmacogenetics is significantly affected by genetic variations in key enzymes and transporters, such as CYP3A4, CYP3A5, UGT1A1, GSTP1, GSTT1, ABCB1, and ABCG2, which are involved in the drug's metabolism, detoxification, and transport. These variations influence etoposide's clearance, efficacy, and toxicity, impacting therapeutic outcomes and individual dosing regimens.
