The pharmacogenetics of darifenacin is significantly influenced by interactions with the enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are vital for its hepatic metabolism. Genetic variations in CYP2D6 can lead to different metabolic rates, causing either higher plasma concentrations and potential adverse effects in poor metabolizers, or reduced efficacy in ultra-rapid metabolizers due to faster clearance of the drug. Variants in CYP3A4 can similarly affect darifenacin levels and outcomes, though its implications are generally less significant than those of CYP2D6.
