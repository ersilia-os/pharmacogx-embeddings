Pravastatin's pharmacogenetic interactions are influenced by genetic variations in several key genes, including HMGCR, which modulates the drug's cholesterol synthesis reduction, SLCO1B1 and SLCO2B1 which affect its hepatic uptake and plasma levels, ABCB1 that impacts its pharmacokinetics, and KIF6 where certain variants enhance cardiovascular benefits in high-dose therapy. These interactions can significantly affect pravastatin's efficacy, safety, and personalized dosing considerations.
