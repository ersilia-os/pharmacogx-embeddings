The metabolism of dexamethasone is influenced by the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 genes, where polymorphisms can significantly alter the drug's metabolism rates and systemic concentrations, necessitating potential dosage adjustments. Additionally, the drug's pharmacodynamics are affected by genetic variants in the NR3C1, HSD11B1, and ABCB1 genes, which modify its sensitivity, response, local effects in tissues, and distribution across cellular barriers, impacting both efficacy and side effect profiles.
