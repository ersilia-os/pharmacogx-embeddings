The genes potentially involved in pharmacogenetic interactions with sulfametopyrazine, a sulfonamide antibiotic, include those encoding cytochrome P450 isoenzymes such as CYP2C9, which can affect drug metabolism and response, and genes such as HLA-B that may predispose individuals to hypersensitivity reactions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome. These interactions are inferred from known effects with similar sulfonamide drugs, though not directly documented for sulfametopyrazine.
