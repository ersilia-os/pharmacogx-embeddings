Warfarin's effectiveness and safety are influenced by genetic variations in the VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genes, affecting its pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, respectively. Polymorphisms in VKORC1, such as rs9923231, modify the enzyme's sensitivity to warfarin impacting the drugâ€™s mechanism of action on the vitamin K cycle and influencing dose requirements, while variants like CYP2C9 *2 and *3 reduce metabolism speed, increasing the risk of drug accumulation and bleeding.
