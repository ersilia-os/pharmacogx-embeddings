The antitubercular drug aminosalicylic acid primarily inhibits folic acid synthesis in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. Although it interacts with genes like PTGS2, CHUK, ALOX5, and PLA2G2E, which are involved in inflammation, these do not directly contribute to its main action against tuberculosis. However, the gene MPO, which codes for myeloperoxidase metabolizing the drug, can affect its pharmacokinetics, with variations potentially impacting the drug's efficacy and safety.
