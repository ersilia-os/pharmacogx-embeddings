Variants in cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4, significantly affect the pharmacogenetic profile of zafirlukast, a drug used in asthma management, by altering its metabolic clearance and thus impacting its effectiveness and the risk of adverse effects. Additionally, genetic differences in enzymes like LTC4S, involved in leukotriene synthesis, and MGAT4B, associated with glycolipid biosynthesis, may theoretically influence the pharmacodynamics of zafirlukast, affecting how well the drug suppresses inflammation and interacts with cellular responses to leukotrienes.
