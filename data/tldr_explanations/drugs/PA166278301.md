Ganaxolone, sold as ZTALMY, enhances the functioning of GABA_A receptors by targeting multiple subunits, crucial for its role in treating seizures linked to CDKL5 deficiency disorder. It is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4, with additional involvement from CYP3A5, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, and genetic variations in these enzymes can significantly affect the drug's metabolism, efficacy, and safety, highlighting the importance of considering these pharmacogenetic factors in patient management.
