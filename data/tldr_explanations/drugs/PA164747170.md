Fulvestrant's pharmacogenetic interactions are primarily influenced by CYP3A4 and potentially UGT1A1, which govern its metabolism. Variations in CYP3A4 affect drug levels, impacting Fulvestrant's safety and efficacy, while UGT1A1 might alter the drug's pharmacokinetics through its role in glucuronidation. Additionally, genetic variants in ESR1, the drug's target, alter the expression or function of estrogen receptors, thereby influencing Fulvestrant's pharmacodynamics and its effectiveness in treating breast cancer.
