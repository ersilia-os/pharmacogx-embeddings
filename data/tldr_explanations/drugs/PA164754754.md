Cevimeline's metabolism is primarily governed by the enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, with variants in CYP2D6 significantly affecting its pharmacokinetics. Poor metabolizers with CYP2D6 variants may experience higher drug plasma levels, increasing both efficacy and side effects, whereas ultra-rapid metabolizers may see reduced effectiveness due to faster drug breakdown. Variations in CYP3A4 activity also modulate cevimeline's concentration and therapeutic outcomes, although its impact is generally less pronounced than that of CYP2D6.
