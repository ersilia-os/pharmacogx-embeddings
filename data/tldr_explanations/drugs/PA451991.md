4-Methoxybenzenesulfinate interacts with MMP13 and MMP3, which are involved in tissue remodeling and matrix degradation. Genetic variations in these genes could potentially affect the drug's effectiveness by altering expression or activity of these enzymes, influencing the outcomes of drug therapy, although this impact is currently based on educated assumptions rather than confirmed data.
