Genetic polymorphisms in NAT2 significantly influence the metabolism of ethambutol, where "slow" alleles can lead to increased drug exposure and risks, including optic neuritis. Additionally, variations in CYP enzymes (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2C19, CYP2C9) and transporter genes such as SLCO1B1 and ABCB1 might also affect the drugâ€™s pharmacokinetics and distribution, although detailed interactions are less understood.
