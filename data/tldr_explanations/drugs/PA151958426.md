Nebivolol's effectiveness and safety are influenced by genetic variations in the CYP2D6 gene, affecting how different individuals metabolize the drug via the cytochrome P450 system. Additionally, while not directly evidenced, variations in beta-adrenergic receptor genes (ADRB1, ADRB2, ADRB3) may hypothetically affect individual responses to nebivolol related to its pharmacodynamics, whereby different gene variations could impact the drug's efficacy and side effects.
