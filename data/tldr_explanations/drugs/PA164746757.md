Variants in the genes CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 significantly influence the metabolism of tolterodine, affecting drug levels and patient responses. CYP2D6 polymorphisms, in particular, categorize individuals into different metabolizer types (from poor to ultra-rapid), impacting drug clearance and necessitating tailored dosing to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize side effects for treating symptoms of overactive bladder.
