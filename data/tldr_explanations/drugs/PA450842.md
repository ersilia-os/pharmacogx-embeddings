Benzylpenicillin's interaction and effectiveness are influenced by genetic variations in human solute carriers such as SLC22A8, SLC15A1, SLC15A2, SLC22A6, SLC22A5, and the SLCO family, which affect the drug’s pharmacokinetics by altering renal reabsorption, hepatic uptake, and biliary excretion. Furthermore, polymorphisms in genes like SLC22A5 or SLCO1B1, as well as variations affecting albumin (ALB), which impacts the drug's plasma distribution, can modify benzylpenicillin’s therapeutic efficacy or toxicity by altering its plasma levels and the free fraction available in the bloodstream.
