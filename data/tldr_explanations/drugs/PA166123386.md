The effectiveness and safety of ruxolitinib are strongly influenced by genetic variations in the CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 genes, which are crucial in the drug's metabolism. Variants in CYP3A4 can lead to altered plasma concentrations of the drug, affecting its therapeutic efficacy and risk of toxicity, while variants like CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 in CYP2C9 result in reduced metabolism, increasing the potential for adverse effects like myelosuppression.
