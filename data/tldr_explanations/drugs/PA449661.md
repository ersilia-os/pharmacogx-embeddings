The pharmacogenetic interactions of flunisolide involve its metabolism by the enzyme CYP3A4 and its mechanism of action through the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), where genetic variations in CYP3A4 affect drug levels and efficacy, and variations in NR3C1 impact the drug’s anti-inflammatory effect. Moreover, SERPINA6 influences flunisolide’s bioavailability by modulating the binding to corticosteroid-binding globulin, affecting both drug efficacy and side effect profiles.
