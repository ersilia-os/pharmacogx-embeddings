Variations in the genes SLC22A6, SLC22A8, SLC15A1, and SLC15A2, which are responsible for drug transport, can impact the pharmacokinetics of cefotaxime, affecting its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. For instance, SLC22A8 influences cefotaxime's renal clearance, potentially altering its levels, efficacy, and susceptibility to side effects, while variants in other mentioned genes may modify its transport, availability, and toxicity.
