Genetic variations in enzymes like CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and the CYP2C family significantly influence the metabolism of vardenafil, affecting its efficacy and risk of adverse effects. Additionally, variations in the PDE5A gene, the primary pharmacodynamic target of vardenafil, and in ABCB1, which encodes for the transporter P-glycoprotein, can alter the drug's effectiveness and its pharmacokinetic profile.
