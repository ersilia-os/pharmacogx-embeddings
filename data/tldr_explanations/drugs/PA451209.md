Quinidine's effects and optimal dosages are influenced by genetic variations in metabolic enzymes like CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, which affect its metabolism and circulating levels, and in transporter genes like ABCB1, which modify drug distribution. Additionally, variations in ion channel genes such as SCN5A and multiple potassium channel genes (KCNH2, KCNK1, KCNK6) can alter quinidine's impact on cardiac action potentials, impacting its efficacy and the risk of arrhythmias.
