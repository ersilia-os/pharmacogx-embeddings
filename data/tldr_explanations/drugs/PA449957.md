Ibuprofen's metabolism is primarily governed by the CYP2C9 enzyme, and variations in the CYP2C9 gene can alter metabolic rates, impacting its therapeutic effectiveness and side effect profile; CYP2C8 and possibly CYP3A5 also play roles in its metabolism. Additionally, genetic variations in PTGS2, which encodes COX-2 targeted by ibuprofen, may influence the drugâ€™s effectiveness in reducing pain and inflammation.
