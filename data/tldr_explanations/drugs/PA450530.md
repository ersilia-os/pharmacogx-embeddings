Modafinil's metabolism is influenced by polymorphisms in several cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and others, affecting its efficacy and risk of side effects. Its pharmacodynamic effects involve interactions with genes like SLC6A3, which mediates dopamine reuptake, ADRA1B, which impacts adrenergic signaling, and the COMT gene where specific polymorphisms can modulate patient responses to the drug.
