Genetic polymorphisms in CYP3A4 and transport proteins ABCB1 and SLC22A8 affect the metabolism, distribution, and excretion of Ivosidenib, influencing its efficacy and safety. Furthermore, mutations in the IDH1 gene, particularly at the R132 position, are essential for the drug's effectiveness, as Ivosidenib targets the abnormal enzyme produced by these mutations, determining patient eligibility and response to treatment.
