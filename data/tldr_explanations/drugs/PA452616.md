The metabolism and efficacy of the drug debrisoquine are primarily influenced by variations in the CYP2D6 gene, which causes individuals to metabolize the drug at different rates, categorized as poor, intermediate, extensive, or ultrarapid metabolizers. This variation leads to differential drug plasma levels, affecting the risk of adverse effects and the necessity for dosage adjustments. Additionally, debrisoquine interacts with P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), impacting its distribution and systemic concentration, although SLC6A2's effect on the drug does not contribute to pharmacogenetic variability.
