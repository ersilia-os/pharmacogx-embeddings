Lenalidomideâ€™s interaction with the CRBN gene is vital for its antitumor effects as it mediates protein degradation critical for tumor cell survival and immune modulation, with variants in CRBN potentially altering the drug's efficacy. Additionally, lenalidomide is affected by the ABCB1 gene which influences its pharmacokinetics through drug efflux, with ABCB1 polymorphisms potentially impacting drug absorption, distribution, and side effects, while genetic variability in genes like TNFSF11, CDH5, and PTGS2 could affect its anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory actions.
