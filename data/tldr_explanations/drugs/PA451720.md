Variations in the COMT gene influence the pharmacodynamic efficacy of tolcapone in Parkinson's disease treatment, with different alleles altering enzyme activity and consequently the drug's effectiveness at inhibiting COMT. On the pharmacokinetic side, polymorphisms in the CYP2C9 gene affect how tolcapone is metabolized, particularly through glucuronidation, which can alter plasma drug levels and impact both efficacy and the potential for adverse effects like hepatotoxicity.
