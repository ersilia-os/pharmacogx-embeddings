The pharmacogenetics of methylprednisolone involve variations in genes such as CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, ABCB1, and NR3C1 that impact the drug's metabolism, distribution, and receptor sensitivity. These genetic differences can significantly affect the rate of methylprednisolone metabolism and its tissue distribution, leading to variations in drug levels, efficacy, and the risk of side effects, depending on the individual genetic makeup.
