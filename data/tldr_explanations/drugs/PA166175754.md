Tezacaftor is designed to rectify CFTR protein defects (notably those from the F508del mutation) by improving ion transfer across cell membranes, with its effectiveness dependent on variations in the CFTR gene. Its metabolism, primarily through CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, and interactions with other CYP enzymes and various transporters, suggest that genetic differences in these metabolic pathways could impact its pharmacokinetics, influencing both the drug's plasma levels and its overall efficacy and safety.
