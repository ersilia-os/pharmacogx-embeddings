Ivabradine's pharmacokinetic properties are significantly affected by genetic polymorphisms in the CYP3A4 enzyme, which metabolizes the drug in the liver, leading to variations in drug efficacy and safety due to different metabolic rates among individuals. Additionally, the drug's pharmacodynamic interaction involves the HCN2 gene, which affects the heart rate-lowering effect of ivabradine, although this interaction is not yet well characterized.
