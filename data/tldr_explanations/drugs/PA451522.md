Variants in the BCHE gene can result in prolonged paralysis effects of the muscle relaxant succinylcholine by impairing butyrylcholinesterase efficiency. Additionally, mutations in the RYR1 and CACNA1S genes, which affect muscle function, can lead to life-threatening reactions like malignant hyperthermia and hyperkalemic responses, particularly under anesthesia, thereby impacting the drug's pharmacodynamic interactions.
