Esomeprazole metabolism is principally mediated by the enzyme CYP2C19, and variations in the CYP2C19 gene, such as the CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 polymorphisms, can significantly reduce enzyme activity and increase drug exposure. Although lesser in impact, CYP3A4 also metabolizes esomeprazole, and its variations can affect the drug's metabolism; other enzymes like CYP2B6 and CYP3A5 might contribute but are not primary pathways.
