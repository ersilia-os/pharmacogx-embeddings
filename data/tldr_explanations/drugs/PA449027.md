The efficacy and safety of cladribine are influenced by the deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) enzyme, which activates the drug into its cytotoxic form, and variations in the DCK gene can impact this process. Additional genes such as ABCG2 and SLC28A3, affecting drug transport, and genes like RRM1, RRM2, RRM2B, POLA1, and POLE, involved in DNA synthesis and repair, play crucial roles in the pharmacodynamics and bioavailability of cladribine, ultimately affecting therapeutic outcomes.
