The metabolism of ondansetron is majorly influenced by the enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A5, with CYP2D6 having a significant impact on the pharmacokinetics, where different genetic variants can lead to variations in drug clearance and exposure, affecting its therapeutic effectiveness and risk of side effects. Additionally, genes like ABCB1, CHRM3, SLC6A4, HTR3B, and HTR3A are involved in the drug's distribution, absorption, and receptor interactions, potentially influencing the efficacy and side effects of ondansetron.
