Genetic variations in the CYP3A4 gene affect the metabolism of teneligliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, potentially influencing the drug's plasma levels, dosing requirements, and risk of adverse effects due to altered enzyme activity. Variants in the DPP-4 gene might also impact the efficacy of teneligliptin in inhibiting the DPP-4 enzyme, thus affecting therapeutic outcomes in managing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
