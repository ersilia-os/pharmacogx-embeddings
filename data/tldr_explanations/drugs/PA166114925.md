The drug mafenide's pharmacogenetic relevance is linked to its inhibition of the enzyme CA6 during metabolic transformation, affecting drug efficacy and safety by potentially varying among individuals due to differences in CA6 activity and expression. This interaction could influence the therapeutic outcomes and adverse effects in the treatment of burn wounds and related metabolic issues. Additionally, caution is advised in G6PD-deficient patients, as the general risks associated with sulfonamides might suggest possible hemolytic anemia, though direct evidence specific to mafenide is lacking.
