Asciminib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor for chronic myeloid leukemia, is metabolized by enzymes CYP3A4, UGT2B7, and UGT2B17, where genetic variants in these enzymes can alter the drug's metabolism, affecting its efficacy and safety. Additionally, transporters like ABCG2 and ABCB1, influenced by genetic variations, modulate the drug's cell efflux and bioavailability, impacting potential dose adjustments.
