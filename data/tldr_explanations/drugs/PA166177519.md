Umeclidinium, used in managing COPD, is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6, and its pharmacokinetics are also influenced by the transport proteins ABCB1, SLC22A1, and SLC22A2, affecting the drug's distribution and elimination. These genetic variations can lead to different drug exposures in individuals, impacting the efficacy and safety of the drug; moreover, genetic variants in muscarinic receptor genes (CHRM1-CHRM5) could also influence responses to the drug, although their clinical relevance has not been fully established.
