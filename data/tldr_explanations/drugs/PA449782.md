Glyburide's pharmacogenetic profile is significantly affected by genetic variations in the CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 enzymes, which alter its metabolism leading to variations in efficacy and safety, particularly influencing the risk for hypoglycemia. Additionally, genetic modifications in the ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes, which affect components of the ATP-sensitive potassium channels in pancreatic beta cells, can alter glyburide's effectiveness in stimulating insulin secretion, impacting the management of type 2 diabetes.
