Tamoxifen's effectiveness is significantly influenced by the gene CYP2D6, which is pivotal in converting the drug to its active form, endoxifen; variations in CYP2D6 can result in decreased efficacy due to lowered endoxifen levels. Other genes like CYP3A4, CYP3A5, ABCB1, various UGT family members, and additional enzymes and transporters such as CYP2C19 and SLCO1B1 also affect the metabolism and bioavailability of tamoxifen and its metabolites, further contributing to the pharmacokinetic variability observed in different patients.
