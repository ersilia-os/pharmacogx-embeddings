Isosorbide dinitrate acts via vasodilation influenced by the NPR1 receptor, enhancing cGMP in vascular smooth muscles and reducing myocardial oxygen demand. The CYP2E1 gene's variability affects the drug's metabolism, potentially altering its clearance and efficacy, though the overall pharmacogenetic profile of this drug is not well-defined.
