The pharmacogenetics of benazepril involves the metabolism of the drug to its active form benazeprilat primarily through esterase-mediated hydrolysis in the liver, and its pharmacodynamics are influenced by polymorphisms in the ACE gene, which can affect the drug's effectiveness in inhibiting ACE. Additionally, variants in the SLC15A1 and SLC15A2 transporter genes impact the drugâ€™s absorption and bioavailability, while CYP11B2 may indirectly affect benazepril's pharmacodynamics related to blood pressure regulation through aldosterone pathways.
