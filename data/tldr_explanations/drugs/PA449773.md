Variations in genes such as **TCF7L2**, **SLC2A2**, **GCK**, **IRS1**, **INS**, and **INSR** play critical roles in influencing insulin secretion, glucose homeostasis, glucose transport, insulin release, and insulin signaling pathways, all of which impact glucose utilization and diabetes management. Gene mutations in these areas can lead to issues like insulin resistance and altered diabetes risk by affecting how glucose is handled in the body.
