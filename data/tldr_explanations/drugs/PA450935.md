Phenylephrine's pharmacogenetic interactions involve its metabolism by genes MAOA, MAOB, and SULT1A3, where variations can alter drug concentration and effectiveness, and its effects are mediated by receptors ADRA1A, ADRA1B, and ADRA1D, where genetic differences impact patient response such as sensitivity to its vasoconstrictive actions. Variants in these metabolic genes can lead to different rates of metabolism, affecting the drug's duration and safety, while variants in receptor genes influence the therapeutic effects and individual tolerance to the drug.
