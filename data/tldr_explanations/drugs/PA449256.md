Dexmedetomidine acts as an agonist at the ADRA2A gene's alpha-2 adrenergic receptor, inhibiting norepinephrine release which results in sedative and analgesic effects. Variations in genes such as COMT that metabolize neurotransmitters like norepinephrine might influence dexmedetomidine's effectiveness and safety by altering neurotransmitter levels, while genetic differences in enzymes like CYP2A6 and other proteins such as PRKCB, USP5, CDCA3, and GNB3 could affect the drug's metabolism, clearance, and signaling pathways, thereby modifying its response and safety profile.
