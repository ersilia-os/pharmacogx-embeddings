Sulfinpyrazone's metabolism is influenced by the CYP2C9 gene, where polymorphisms can alter drug efficacy and toxicity, necessitating potential dose adjustments. The drug also interacts with transporter genes like SLC22A12 and ABCB11, affecting its uricosuric action in promoting urate excretion, therefore impacting its effectiveness in reducing serum urate levels.
