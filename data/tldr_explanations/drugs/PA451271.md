The metabolism of ropivacaine is significantly influenced by genetic variations in CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2B6, with CYP1A2 playing a major role in its metabolic degradation, which affects the drug's plasma concentration, duration, and effectiveness of anesthesia. Additionally, variations in CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 affect the pharmacokinetics of ropivacaine to a lesser degree, influencing both the rate and extent of metabolism, while interactions with proteins like ORM1 can alter its distribution and availability, impacting its pharmacodynamics.
