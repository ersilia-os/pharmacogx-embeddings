The metabolism of the antidepressant mianserin is significantly influenced by the enzyme CYP2D6, which varies due to genetic polymorphisms, creating different metabolic phenotypes (poor, intermediate, extensive, and ultrarapid metabolizers). These variations impact mianserin's plasma levels and thus its effectiveness and safety, leading to potential adjustments in dosing to optimize therapeutic outcomes and reduce side effects based on individual CYP2D6 status.
