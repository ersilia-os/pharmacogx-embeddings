Clozapine metabolism is significantly affected by variations in the genes CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, with polymorphisms in these genes influencing the drug's plasma levels and risk of adverse effects. Additionally, pharmacodynamic interactions involve genes like HTR2C and DRD2, which encode receptors targeted by clozapine and influence its efficacy and side effects, with gene variations possibly affecting the therapeutic response and side effect susceptibility.
