Variations in the CYP2C19 gene, along with contributions from CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 polymorphisms, significantly affect mavacamten metabolism. Such genetic differences lead to varying plasma concentrations in individuals; where poor metabolizers might experience higher drug concentrations and potential side effects, ultra-rapid metabolizers might see reduced drug levels and efficacy, indicating a need for customized dosing to optimize treatment outcomes.
