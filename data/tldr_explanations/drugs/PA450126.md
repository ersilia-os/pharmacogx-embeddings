Isosorbide mononitrate's effectiveness and patient response can be influenced by genetic variations in key metabolizing enzymes such as GSTM1, XDH, and ADH5, which are responsible for converting the drug into nitric oxide and its inactive metabolites. Variants in these genes can impact drug pharmacokinetics by altering clearance rates and serum concentrations, while genes like CYB5R1-4, though not directly involved in primary metabolism, may affect secondary metabolic pathways and the synthesis of nitric oxide, further influencing the drugâ€™s efficacy.
