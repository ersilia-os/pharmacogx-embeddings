Genetic variations in CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 significantly affect the metabolism of loperamide, altering its plasma levels and, hence, its effectiveness and safety by either enhancing or reducing drug metabolism. Additionally, mutations in the ABCB1 gene, which codes for the P-glycoprotein transporter, can influence loperamide's bioavailability and its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, further impacting its therapeutic efficacy and potential toxicity.
