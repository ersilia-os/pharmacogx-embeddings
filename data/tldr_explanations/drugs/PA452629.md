The metabolism of zuclopenthixol, a drug used in treating psychosis, is significantly influenced by variations in the CYP2D6 gene, leading to classifications such as poor, intermediate, extensive, or ultra-rapid metabolizers. These genetic variations affect the drug levels and clearance rates in individuals, thereby impacting the effective dosage and potentially altering therapeutic outcomes and the incidence of side effects, which necessitates tailored clinical management to enhance treatment efficacy and safety.
