Desvenlafaxine metabolism is primarily influenced by UGT enzymes (notably UGT1A1 and UGT1A3), leading to variable drug clearance and efficacy due to polymorphisms in these genes, while minor metabolism pathways involve CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, also affected by genetic variations. Furthermore, its pharmacodynamics are affected by neurotransmitter transporter genes (SLC6A4, SLC6A2, SLC6A3), ABC transporter genes (ABCB1, ABCC1), and the serotonin receptor gene HTR7, all of which contribute to differences in therapeutic outcomes due to variations in drug transport and receptor function.
