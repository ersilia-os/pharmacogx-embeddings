Primaquine's pharmacogenetics are heavily influenced by its interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP1A1, and CYP1B1, where genetic polymorphisms especially in CYP2D6 can lead to variable drug metabolism, affecting the drugâ€™s efficacy and toxicity. Additionally, in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, Primaquine can cause hemolytic anemia due to increased red blood cell vulnerability to oxidative damage, highlighting the need for genetic testing for G6PD deficiency before treatment to ensure safety and efficacy.
