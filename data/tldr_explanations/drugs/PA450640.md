Nitrofurantoin's effectiveness and safety are influenced by polymorphisms in human transporter genes such as ABCG2, ABCB11, ABCB1, and ABCC2, which affect the drug's efflux, distribution, and excretion, and by the G6PD gene, where variations increase the risk of hemolysis in individuals with G6PD deficiency, particularly because the drug can induce oxidative stress. Although primarily acting through bacterial enzymes, these human genetic factors significantly impact the drug's clinical use and patient response.
