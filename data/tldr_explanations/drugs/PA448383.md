Amiodarone's efficacy and safety are affected by genetic variations in metabolizing enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP4F2, and transporters like ABCG2, which influence its plasma concentration, distribution, and elimination. Additionally, genetic variants in KCNH2 and KCNE1, which are involved in cardiac repolarization, can alter the drug's pharmacodynamic effects, particularly impacting the risk of arrhythmias like prolonged QT interval and torsades de pointes in patients.
