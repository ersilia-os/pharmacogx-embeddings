Genetic variants in the CYP2C19 gene, such as rs4986893, rs41291556, and rs72558186, significantly impact the metabolism of mephenytoin, leading to poor metabolizer phenotypes that necessitate dosage adjustments to achieve therapeutic effectiveness and avoid toxicity. Although mephenytoin also interacts with other cytochrome P450 enzymes and could be influenced by NR1I2 which regulates these enzymes, the primary pharmacogenetic focus lies on the interactions involving CYP2C19.
