The pharmacokinetics of cephalexin, notably its absorption and excretion, are significantly influenced by the genetic variations in transporter genes such as SLC22A6 and SLC15A1, which are responsible for its renal excretion and intestinal absorption respectively. Variants in these genes, as well as others like SLC22A5, SLC15A2, SLC22A8, and SLC47A1, can affect the levels of cephalexin reaching the systemic circulation and its subsequent excretion, potentially impacting therapeutic outcomes and drug tolerability due to altered drug exposure. Additionally, variations in the ALB gene, which codes for albumin that carries cephalexin in the serum, might modify the drugâ€™s distribution and availability by affecting binding efficiency.
