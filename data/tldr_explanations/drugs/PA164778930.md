Genetic variations in the SLC6A8 gene significantly affect the creatine transportation system which is vital for its uptake into muscle and brain cells, potentially leading to conditions like cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes. Additionally, genes such as CKM, CKB, CKMT1A, and CKMT2, which regulate the metabolism of creatine into phosphocreatine, influence the effectiveness of ATP replenishment during high-energy demands, thereby affecting muscle performance and recovery. Variants in the SLC22A5 gene may also theoretically influence creatine transport due to its role in organic cation transport.
