Ponatinib's effectiveness and safety are influenced by genetic factors impacting both its metabolism and therapeutic targeting mechanisms. Key interactions include mutations like T315I in the BCR-ABL fusion protein, which affects drug resistance, and polymorphisms in CYP enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and CYP2D6 that alter its metabolism, along with transporter proteins like ABCB1 and ABCG2 which can modify drug disposition and resistance, thus affecting ponatinib's efficacy and toxicity.
