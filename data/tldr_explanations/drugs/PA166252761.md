Fosdenopterin interacts pharmacogenetically primarily through mutations in the _MOCS1_ gene, which disrupts molybdenum cofactor synthesis and affect the drug's pharmacodynamics by compensating for deficient cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP). Additionally, genetic variations in renal transporters SLC47A2, SLC22A6, and SLC47A1 may influence the drug's pharmacokinetics, particularly affecting the renal elimination of fosdenopterin or its metabolites, potentially altering drug levels and efficacy.
