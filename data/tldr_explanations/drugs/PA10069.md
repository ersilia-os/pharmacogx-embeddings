The pharmacokinetics and efficacy of emtricitabine, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, are influenced by several genes: SLC47A1 impacts its renal secretion and potentially drug levels and toxicity; DCK is essential for the drug's activation; ABCC2 might affect transport and elimination; and NR1I2 could indirectly alter pharmacokinetics by regulating expression of enzymes and transporters. Furthermore, the gene HLA-B may influence immune responses related to emtricitabine, though its role is more speculative.
