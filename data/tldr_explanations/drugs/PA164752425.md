Nelarabine's pharmacogenetic interaction involves the drug's metabolism by adenosine deaminase (ADA), which activates it to ara-G, followed by further activation steps mediated by deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) and deoxyguanosine kinase (DGUOK). The variability in ADA, DCK, DGUOK, and the drug transporter gene SLC29A1 influence nelarabine's activation, efficacy, and toxicity by affecting both the drug's metabolism and the cellular uptake of its active forms.
