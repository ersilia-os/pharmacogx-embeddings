Decitabine's effectiveness is influenced by interactions among various genes: DCK, crucial for activating the drug; CDA, affecting its degradation; SLC28A1, responsible for its cellular uptake; and DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B), which are inhibited by the drug impacting DNA methylation and tumor suppressor gene activation. Additionally, variations in HLA-A could subtly influence immune responses, potentially affecting treatment outcomes in myelodysplastic syndromes and leukemia.
