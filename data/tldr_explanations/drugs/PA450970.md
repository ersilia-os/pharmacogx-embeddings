Pioglitazone, a type 2 diabetes medication, interacts with the PPARG gene to modulate insulin sensitivity directly and relies on metabolic enzymes like CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, along with transporters SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3, for its pharmacokinetics. Genetic variations in these enzymes and transporters can significantly affect the drug's metabolism, levels, efficacy, and risk of adverse effects, altering its therapeutic effectiveness in patients.
