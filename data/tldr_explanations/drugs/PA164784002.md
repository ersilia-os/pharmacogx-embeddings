Sertindole, an antipsychotic drug for schizophrenia, is metabolized mainly by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes; variations in CYP2D6 significantly affect its plasma concentration, influencing drug efficacy and safety risks, such as cardiac side effects through prolonged QT intervals. CYP3A4 also affects metabolism but less so than CYP2D6, making the genetic variants of both crucial in determining the appropriate dosing and monitoring to manage adverse effects and ensure effective treatment outcomes.
