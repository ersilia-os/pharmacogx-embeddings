Genetic variations in genes such as SLC22A1, SLC22A2, SLC22A3 (encoding OCT1, OCT2, and OCT3), and SLC47A1, SLC47A2 (encoding MATE1 and MATE2) significantly influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of metformin by affecting drug transport, metabolism, and excretion. These variations can alter metformin's effectiveness and safety, impacting its ability to control blood glucose and its risk of causing lactic acidosis.
