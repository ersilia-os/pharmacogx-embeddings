Allopurinolâ€™s pharmacogenetic interactions involve the genes XDH and AOX1 in its metabolism, ABCG2 and SLC22A2 affecting its pharmacokinetics, and UGT family genes impacting the bioavailability and clearance of its active metabolite oxipurinol. Additionally, the HLA-B*5801 allele is crucial for predicting the risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome, particularly in certain populations, which highlights the drug's varied response based on genetic makeup.
