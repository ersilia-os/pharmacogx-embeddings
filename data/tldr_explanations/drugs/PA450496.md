Midazolam's pharmacogenetics is affected by its metabolism involving CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 enzymes and its transport mediated by the ABCB1 gene. Genetic variations in these enzymes and transporter genes alter midazolamâ€™s clearance rates, plasma concentrations, and brain access, influencing its sedative effects and side effects. Furthermore, genes like POR, NR1I2, and possibly VDR support these processes through various regulatory and enabling roles, impacting midazolam's overall pharmacokinetic behavior.
