Cotinine pharmacogenetics is influenced by variations in the CYP2A6 gene, which affects how quickly nicotine is metabolized to cotinine, thereby impacting nicotine withdrawal and dependence. Other genes such as CYP2B6, NAT1, and UGT2B10 also play roles in the metabolism and excretion of nicotine and its derivatives, while genes like OPRM1, PSMA4, CHRNB4, CHRNA3, and CHRNA5 are involved in the pharmacodynamic effects by influencing how nicotine interacts with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, affecting addiction and withdrawal symptoms.
