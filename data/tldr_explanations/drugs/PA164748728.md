Genetic polymorphisms in UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 significantly affect the metabolism of mycophenolic acid, influencing drug clearance rates, efficacy, and toxicity. Additionally, genes like SLCO1B1 and ABCC2 impact the drug's pharmacokinetics through hepatic processes, whereas HPRT1, NFATC1, and genetic variations in IMPDH1, the drug's target, potentially alter pharmacodynamics, impacting the drug's effectiveness and safety.
