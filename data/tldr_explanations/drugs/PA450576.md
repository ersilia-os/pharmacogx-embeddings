Nafcillin's metabolism involves cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, where genetic variations in these enzymes can lead to different metabolic rates of the drug, potentially impacting its efficacy and safety. Additionally, genetic variants in the SLC22A6 transporter may affect nafcillin's elimination through the kidneys, and variations in albumin levels, which also bind nafcillin, could influence its bioavailability.
