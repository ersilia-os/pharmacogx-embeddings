Genetic variations in enzymes such as CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, UGT, and SULT can affect the pharmacokinetics of apomorphine by influencing its metabolism, plasma concentration, clearance, and bioavailability. Additionally, polymorphisms in dopamine receptor genes like DRD2 and regulatory genes such as ANKK1 impact the drug's pharmacodynamics, affecting its therapeutic efficacy and the management of symptoms in Parkinson's disease patients.
