Variants in the CYP3A4 gene significantly impact the metabolism of sufentanil, affecting its efficacy and safety by altering drug exposure. Additionally, genetic differences in μ-opioid receptors (encoded by OPRM1), as well as δ-type (OPRD1) and κ-type (OPRK1) receptors, and other genes like ABCB1, CYP3A5, COMT, and NFKBIA, influence patient responses in terms of analgesic effects and side effect profiles, as well as sufentanil's distribution, elimination, and overall pharmacodynamics. This highlights the importance of genetic factors in determining the pharmacological action and patient-specific outcomes of using sufentanil.
