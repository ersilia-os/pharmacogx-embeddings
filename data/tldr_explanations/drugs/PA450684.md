Genetic variants of the enzyme CYP1A2, which metabolizes ofloxacin, can significantly alter the drug's pharmacokineticsâ€”variants decreasing enzyme activity may increase toxicity risk by reducing metabolism, while those increasing activity could reduce drug efficacy by enhancing metabolism. Additionally, variations in genes encoding transporter proteins such as SLC22A5, SLC22A6, SLC22A4, ABCC1, ABCC2, and ABCB11 influence ofloxacin's absorption, distribution, and excretion, affecting its bioavailability and clearance, while G6PD deficiency might predispose patients to hemolytic anemia, although its direct connection to ofloxacin requires further evidence.
