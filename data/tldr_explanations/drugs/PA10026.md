The pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic, are significantly affected by genetic polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 enzyme, leading to variations in drug metabolism that necessitate dose adjustments: poor metabolizers may require lower doses due to higher plasma concentrations, while ultra-rapid metabolizers might need increased doses to attain therapeutic effects. Additionally, the ABCB1 transporter gene influences the absorption and distribution of Aripiprazole, though its clinical impact is less clear compared to CYP2D6.
