Deleobuvir, a drug targeting HCV's NS5B polymerase, may interact with genetic factors through its role in inhibiting viral replication, specifically involving the genes IFNL3 and IFNL4. These genes, which affect the immune response to HCV, can influence the natural clearance of the virus and the response to antiviral therapies, thereby potentially impacting the effectiveness of treatments including deleobuvir, primarily through pharmacodynamic mechanisms related to host-virus interactions.
