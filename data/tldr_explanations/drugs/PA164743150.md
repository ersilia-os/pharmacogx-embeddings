Labetalol metabolism and efficacy are significantly influenced by genetic variations in cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2D6, CYP2C19) and UGT enzymes (UGT1A1, UGT2B7, UGT1A9). Polymorphisms in these genes affect how individuals metabolize labetalol, leading to variations in drug clearance, plasma concentrations, and potential toxicity, which are critical for tailoring treatment to individual patient needs in managing hypertension.
