Sildenafil's pharmacogenetics prominently involves the metabolism-related CYP3A4 gene, which affects the drug’s plasma concentration and safety by varying metabolic rates, and PDE5A, which sildenafil directly targets to enhance erectile function, indicating potential efficacy changes depending on genetic variants. Additionally, genes such as ABCB1, ACE, and GNB3 influence pharmacokinetics and therapeutic responses through their roles in drug transport, distribution, and cardiovascular physiology relevant to sildenafil’s action.
