Delamanid's metabolism in humans is predominantly governed by the CYP3A4 enzyme, with variations in the CYP3A4 gene affecting the drug's pharmacokinetics through altered enzyme activity, impacting its efficacy and safety. Additionally, genetic variations in the proteins albumin (ALB) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1) might affect delamanid's distribution and half-life, while mutations in the mycobacterial enzyme required for activating delamanid can lead to drug resistance by altering enzyme efficiency.
