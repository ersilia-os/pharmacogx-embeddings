Erdafitinib's pharmacogenetic interactions are influenced by metabolism via CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 enzymes, with variants like CYP2C9*3 potentially causing increased plasma concentrations and toxicity, which suggests the need for genotyping to guide dosage adjustments. Additionally, its therapeutic efficacy is dependent on the presence of mutations in FGFR2 and FGFR3 genes, thereby requiring their genetic testing to predict treatment response in patients.
