The pharmacogenetics of Ataluren is influenced by the liver and intestinal metabolism via UGT1A9 enzyme, and variations in this gene may alter Ataluren's metabolism, affecting its plasma levels, efficacy, and safety. Additionally, the renal excretion handled by SLC22A6 and SLC22A8, and hepatic uptake by SLCO1B3 are genetically variable, which can further impact the drug's clearance, blood concentrations, and overall effectiveness in treating Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.
