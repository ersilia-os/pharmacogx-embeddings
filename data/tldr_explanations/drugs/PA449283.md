Genetic variations in CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 enzymes primarily influence the metabolism of diazepam, affecting the drug's clearance and plasma levels, with CYP2C19 having a more pronounced impact. Additionally, ABCB1 transporter variations modify the distribution and elimination of diazepam, while differences in GABA(A) receptor genes might alter its therapeutic efficacy by affecting pharmacodynamics.
