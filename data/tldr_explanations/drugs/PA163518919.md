Genetic variations in CYP2D6 can lead to different plasma levels of the antipsychotic drug paliperidone, affecting its side effect severity, while variants in the ABCB1 gene can alter the drug's absorption and distribution, impacting its therapeutic efficacy and side effects. Other genes like NFIB, SH2B1, RABEP1, and MC4R may also influence the drug's effectiveness and safety through mechanisms not directly related to its primary metabolism or transport pathways.
