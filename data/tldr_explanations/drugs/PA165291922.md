Doxorubicinol, an active metabolite of doxorubicin, is influenced by the gene CBR1, which governs its formation from doxorubicin and affects its efficacy and toxicity. Additionally, the transporter gene SLC22A16 may impact the cellular uptake of doxorubicinol, further influencing its therapeutic effectiveness and patient response to treatment.
