Haloperidol metabolism is significantly influenced by genetic variations in the CYP2D6 enzyme, affecting the drug's concentration and resulting in different clinical responses and side effects; poor metabolizers experience higher drug levels and more adverse effects, while ultra-rapid metabolizers have lower levels potentially leading to reduced efficacy. Additionally, genetic variations in the D2 dopamine receptor (DRD2) can affect haloperidol's therapeutic effects and side effect profile by altering receptor sensitivity and density.
