Ivacaftor's effectiveness and safety in treating cystic fibrosis are influenced by genetic variations in multiple genes: CFTR determines patient eligibility based on gating mutations, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 majorly dictate its metabolism, CYP2C9 and ABCB1 affect its metabolism and distribution respectively, while ALB and ORM1 impact its plasma levels and distribution. Additionally, variations in non-pharmacokinetic genes like SLC26A9 may also affect treatment due to their roles in shared pathways of cystic fibrosis pathology, highlighting the importance of personalized medication approaches.
