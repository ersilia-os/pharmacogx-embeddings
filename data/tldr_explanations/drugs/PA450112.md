Isoniazid pharmacogenetics is significantly influenced by the NAT2 gene, which encodes for the enzyme responsible for the acetylation of isoniazid, causing variability in drug metabolism rates; this variability categorizes individuals as rapid or slow acetylators, affecting their risk for adverse effects such as hepatotoxicity and peripheral neuropathy. Other genes like CYP2E1, GSTT1, GSTM1, GSTP1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and SLCO1B1 also affect isoniazid’s metabolism and detoxification, influencing the drug’s pharmacokinetics and the susceptibility to its toxicity.
