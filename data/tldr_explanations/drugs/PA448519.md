Genetic variations in the CYP3A4 enzyme significantly affect the metabolism of azithromycin, impacting drug levels and influencing both the drug's effectiveness and potential side effects due to differences in enzyme activity among individuals. Additionally, variants in the ABCB1 and ABCC2 genes alter the efficacy of azithromycin's transport and excretion processes, thereby affecting the drug's bioavailability, plasma concentration, and therapeutic outcomes.
