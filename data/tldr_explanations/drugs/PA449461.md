The pharmacogenetics of enflurane primarily involves its metabolism by the liver enzyme CYP2E1 and interactions with neural receptors like GABA(A) receptor subunits and calcium channel subunits. Gene variations in CYP2E1 affect the metabolic rate of enflurane, which can alter the anesthetic effects and risk of toxicities such as hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity, while variability in genes coding for GABA(A) receptor subunits and calcium channels influences the drugâ€™s CNS depressant effects, sedation depth, muscle relaxation, and cardiovascular impacts.
