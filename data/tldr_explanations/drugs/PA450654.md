The metabolism and clearance of Norfloxacin are significantly influenced by genetic variations in the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, which impact its hepatic metabolism and subsequently affect the drug's efficacy and safety. Additionally, transport-related genes like SLC22A5 and SLC22A6 also influence Norfloxacin's pharmacokinetics by modifying renal clearance, thereby affecting its absorption, elimination, and overall therapeutic outcomes.
