Epoetin alfa, a drug used to stimulate erythropoiesis, operates primarily through the interaction with the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) gene and may also interact with the JAK2/STAT5 pathway genes, influencing the drug's effectiveness and the risk of adverse effects like thromboembolism. Additionally, the HFE gene, related to iron metabolism, may indirectly affect the drug's response due to its role in erythropoiesis.
