Genes such as HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1, which are crucial components of the immune system's Major Histocompatibility Complex class II, could potentially influence how patients react to bucillamine, a drug used for rheumatoid arthritis and gout. Since variations in these genes impact the immune response, they might affect the drug’s effectiveness or the occurrence of adverse reactions, though this link is hypothesized based on the drug’s application and the general functions of these genes, not on concrete pharmacogenetic interaction data with bucillamine.
