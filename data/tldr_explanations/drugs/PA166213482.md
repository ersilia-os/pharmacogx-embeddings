Raloxifene metabolism, particularly into raloxifene 6-glucuronide, is significantly influenced by the UGT1A1 gene, which regulates the glucuronidation process affecting drug plasma levels and thus its safety and efficacy. Additionally, genetic variations in estrogen receptor genes, ESR1 and ESR2, can modify the pharmacodynamic effects of raloxifene, impacting outcomes such as bone density and breast cancer risk reduction.
