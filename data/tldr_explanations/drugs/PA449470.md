Genetic variations in key enzymes such as COMT, MAOA, and MAOB, which metabolize epinephrine into metanephrine and normetanephrine, can significantly affect the drugâ€™s pharmacokinetics by altering the intensity and duration of its effects. Additionally, polymorphisms in adrenergic receptors, particularly ADRB2, influence how patients respond to epinephrine, which is critical for managing conditions like asthma and stabilizing cardiovascular function during anaphylactic reactions. Variants in additional enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, though less directly involved, may also subtly affect epinephrine's systemic clearance rates.
