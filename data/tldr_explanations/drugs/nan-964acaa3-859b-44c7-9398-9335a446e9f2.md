The efficacy and toxicity of Capreomycin, an atypical aminoglycoside used against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, can be influenced by genetic variations in genes related to protein synthesis and ion transport, and drug handling genes like MDR1 and SLC22A2, which may impact drug uptake and excretion. Genes such as MT-RNR1, associated with aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss, might also influence Capreomycin's side effects like nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.
