Palonosetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist metabolized by hepatic enzymes CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2, is impacted by genetic variations in these enzymes, affecting its pharmacokinetics. Variants in CYP2D6 may lead to higher or lower plasma concentrations of the drug, influencing its efficacy and safety, while polymorphisms in CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 also alter enzyme activity and therefore the metabolism rate of palonosetron.
