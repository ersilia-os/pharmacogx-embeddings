Grazoprevir, a direct-acting antiviral drug for Hepatitis C, is significantly affected by pharmacogenetic interactions involving the CYP3A4 gene, which is crucial for its metabolism. Variants in this gene can alter drug levels and efficacy, while genetic differences in transporters like ABCB1, SLCO1B1, and SLCO1B3 impact its bioavailability, distribution, and elimination, thereby influencing the drug's plasma concentrations and duration of action.
