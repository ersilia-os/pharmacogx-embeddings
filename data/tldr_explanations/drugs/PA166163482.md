Brigatinib's metabolism is strongly influenced by the CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 enzymes, with variations in these genes affecting the drugâ€™s plasma levels and, consequently, its efficacy and toxicity. Additionally, brigatinib's effectiveness also depends on mutations in its target genes, ALK and EGFR, which influence the drug's therapeutic response, particularly in conditions like ALK-positive NSCLC where resistance to previous treatments like crizotinib has developed. Therefore, genetic profiling of these metabolic enzymes and target genes is crucial to optimizing treatment outcomes.
