Dexrazoxane targets the enzymatic function of TOP2A and TOP2B to mitigate the cardiotoxic effects of anthracyclines by protecting DNA structure, which is a pharmacodynamic interaction. Variants in genes related to iron metabolism or enzymes involved in hydrolysis, like dihydropyrimidine amidohydrolase, could potentially influence the efficacy and safety of dexrazoxane, particularly its cardioprotective effects.
