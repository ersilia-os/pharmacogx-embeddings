Budesonide's pharmacogenetic interactions involve crucial genes impacting both its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 primarily influence its metabolism, while genes like NR3C1 (a glucocorticoid receptor), TBX21, FCER2, GLCCI1, CRHR1, ADRB2, and ZNF432 play significant roles in its pharmacodynamics by affecting drug sensitivity, responsiveness, and side effect profiles.
