The pharmacogenetics of salmeterol involves its interaction with the ADRB2 gene and metabolism by the CYP3A4 enzyme; genetic variations in ADRB2 can alter beta-2 adrenergic receptor function, affecting the drug's efficacy and side effect profile, while polymorphisms in CYP3A4 and other CYP enzymes influence the drug's plasma concentration and duration of action by affecting its metabolic degradation, thereby impacting safety and effectiveness.
