Amoxapine's pharmacogenetic interactions primarily involve the CYP2D6 enzyme, which due to its genetic variability, impacts drug metabolism and consequently, its efficacy and safety. Individuals with different CYP2D6 genetic profiles (poor or ultra-rapid metabolizers) may experience higher risks of side effects or diminished therapeutic effects, respectively, which can necessitate dosage adjustments.
