Variability in genes like CYP3A4 and SULT2A1, which are involved in the metabolism of palbociclib, can significantly impact the pharmacokinetics of the drug in individuals, affecting both its efficacy and risk of adverse effects. Additionally, genetic variations in transport proteins such as ABCB1 and ABCG2 may also modify the pharmacokinetic profile of palbociclib by altering its bioavailability and systemic clearance.
