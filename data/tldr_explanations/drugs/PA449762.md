The metabolism and effectiveness of the diabetes drug glipizide are significantly impacted by genetic variations, particularly in the CYP2C9 gene. Polymorphisms in CYP2C9, notably variant rs1057910, lead to slower drug metabolism and increased risk of hypoglycemia, necessitating dosage adjustments for affected patients. Other genes such as NOS1AP, TCF7L2, and G6PD may influence the drug's pharmacodynamics and risk of adverse effects, though their interactions with glipizide are less explicitly established.
