Variations in the genes encoding for the enzymes CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and CYP2C8 can lead to differences in the metabolic rate of avatrombopag, necessitating potential dosage adjustments. Similarly, genetic differences in the transporters ABCB1, ABCG2, and SLC22A8 affect the drug's distribution and elimination, which could influence avatrombopag's bioavailability, therapeutic outcomes, and adverse effects.
