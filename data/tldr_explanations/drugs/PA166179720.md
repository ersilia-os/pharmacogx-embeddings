Tapentadol's efficacy and safety are affected by genetic variations in the OPRM1 gene, which impact the mu-opioid receptor binding affinity, altering the drug's analgesic and side effect profile. Additionally, its metabolism is primarily influenced by the UGT2B7 and UGT1A9 genes, where genetic polymorphisms can alter pharmacokinetics, affecting drug levels and potentially modifying effectiveness and risk of side effects.
