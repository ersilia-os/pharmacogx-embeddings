Atropine interacts pharmacogenetically mainly through its impact on muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1-5) and neuronal acetylcholine receptors (CHRNA4 and CHRNB2), where genetic variations can affect its pharmacodynamic effects such as heart rate and neurological responses. Additionally, genetic differences in the transporter gene ABCB11 and the plasma carrier protein ORM1 can modify atropine's pharmacokinetic properties, impacting its distribution, bioavailability, and excretion.
