Clomipramine's pharmacogenetics involves key genes such as CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and ABCB1 that affect its pharmacokinetics through variations in drug metabolism, bioavailability, and distribution. Additionally, pharmacodynamic interactions involve genes like HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and SLC6A4, which influence the drug's effectiveness by affecting serotonin receptor function and serotonin reuptake, crucial for treating depressive and obsessive symptoms.
