Regadenoson targets the ADORA2A gene and binds to the A2A adenosine receptor, with variations in the ADORA2A gene potentially affecting the drugâ€™s effectiveness in coronary vasodilation. Additionally, the AMPD1 gene, which plays a role in adenosine metabolism, may influence Regadenoson's response, although direct interactions with the drug are not explicitly documented.
