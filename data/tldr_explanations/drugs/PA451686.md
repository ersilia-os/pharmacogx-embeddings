Ticlopidine's effectiveness and safety are affected by genetic variations, particularly in the CYP2C19 gene, which influences the drug's metabolic transformation into active metabolites and thereby impacts drug levels and response. Additionally, variants in HLA alleles may affect the incidence of immune-mediated adverse reactions like neutropenia and agranulocytosis, although their role in the drug's pharmacodynamics is less clear.
