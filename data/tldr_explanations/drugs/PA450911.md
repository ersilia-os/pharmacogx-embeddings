Phenobarbital's pharmacogenetics is influenced by its metabolism through enzymes such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4, where genetic polymorphisms in these enzymes can alter drug metabolism rates, affecting its efficacy and toxicity. Additionally, UGT family enzymes involved in drug elimination, and genetic variations in transporter protein ABCB1 and other non-enzyme factors like MTHFR and HLA genes, can also impact the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of phenobarbital, influencing individual drug responses and potential adverse reactions.
