Rucaparib, a PARP inhibitor effective in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutant cancers, interacts pharmacokinetically and pharmacodynamically with several genes. Variants in the genes BRCA1, BRCA2, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, ABCB1, and ABCG2 influence its metabolism, efficacy, and toxicity by affecting the drug's processing, distribution, and elimination in the body.
