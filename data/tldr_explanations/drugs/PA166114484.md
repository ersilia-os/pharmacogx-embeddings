XK469, a topoisomerase II inhibitor aimed at treating cancer, primarily interacts with the TOP2 gene that encodes the enzyme it targets, influencing its ability to impair DNA replication and cell division in cancer cells. Additionally, variations in the AOX1 gene, which is involved in the drug's metabolism, could affect the clearance and overall exposure of XK469, thereby impacting treatment outcomes.
