The metabolism of the drug theophylline is heavily influenced by cytochrome P450 enzymes, notably CYP1A2 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2E1. Genetic variations in CYP1A2 can alter enzyme activity, thereby affecting the drugâ€™s plasma levels, efficacy, and risk of adverse effects, necessitating dose adjustments based on individual genetic profiles.
