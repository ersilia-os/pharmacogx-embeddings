Variations in the CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genes significantly influence the metabolism of Doxepin, a tricyclic antidepressant, affecting its efficacy and safety due to differences in plasma drug levels. Poor metabolizers with reduced enzyme activity may face increased adverse effects, while ultra-rapid metabolizers could find standard doses ineffective; genetic variations in P-glycoprotein function also affect Doxepin's distribution and excretion, further impacting treatment response.
