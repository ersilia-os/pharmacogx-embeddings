Atenolol's effects are primarily mediated through the ADRB1 gene, which codes for the Beta-1 adrenergic receptor, influencing heart rate and myocardial contractility. Genetic variations in ADRB1, CYP2D6, ABCB1, and ABCB11 can affect the drug's efficacy, side effects, metabolism, and overall pharmacokinetics, impacting individual responses to atenolol.
