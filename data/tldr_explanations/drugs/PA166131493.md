Pharmacogenetic variations in the CYP2D6 gene significantly affect the metabolism of tramadol into its active metabolite, n-desmethyltramadol, influencing therapeutic outcomes and side effects. Variations in CYP2D6 can lead to different metabolic rates; for instance, ultra-rapid metabolizers might experience increased effects and toxicity, while poor metabolizers may find tramadol less effective due to impaired conversion into n-desmethyltramadol. Additionally, the CYP3A4 gene also contributes to the metabolism of tramadol, though its role is less significant than CYP2D6.
