Carbamazepine metabolism involves various cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, where genetic polymorphisms in these enzymes can affect the drug's metabolic rates, impacting its efficacy and toxicity. Additionally, the efficacy of carbamazepine in controlling seizures is influenced by variants in the SCN1A gene, and the risk of severe skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome is associated with the HLA-B*1502 and HLA-A*3101 alleles, highlighting the importance of genetic testing in optimizing treatment and reducing adverse effects.
