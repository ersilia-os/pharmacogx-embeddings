Levoketoconazole is primarily metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme, but its efficacy and safety can also be influenced by genetic variations in the CYP3A5 gene, which can lead to different levels of drug exposure and thereby affect both therapeutic and adverse effects. Although the CYP4F2 gene is involved in other metabolic pathways such as vitamin K metabolism, its direct impact on levoketoconazole's metabolism or efficacy remains speculative and less established.
