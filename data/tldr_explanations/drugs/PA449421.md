Dronabinol, a synthetic Δ⁹-THC, interacts with cannabinoid receptors and is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, with variations in these genes affecting its metabolism, efficacy, and safety. Additionally, genetic differences in transporters like ABCB1 can influence the drug's distribution and excretion, further affecting individual responses and side effects.
