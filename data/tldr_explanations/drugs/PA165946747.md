Hydroxyamitriptyline's metabolic conversion from amitriptyline is catalyzed by the CYP2D6 enzyme, and genetic variations in CYP2D6 affect the drug's plasma concentration. Individuals with poor metabolizer variants of CYP2D6 may have increased plasma levels leading to potential side effects and toxicity, whereas ultra-rapid metabolizers could experience reduced antidepressant effects due to faster drug metabolism.
