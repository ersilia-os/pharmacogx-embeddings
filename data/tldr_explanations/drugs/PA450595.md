The metabolism and efficacy of naproxen are significantly influenced by mutations in genes such as CYP2C9, which is crucial for hepatic metabolism. Variants in this gene can alter enzyme activity, potentially leading to higher drug plasma levels and an increased risk of side effects like gastrointestinal bleeding and renal impairments. Other genes like SLCO1A2, ABCB1, and UGT2B7 also play a role in its pharmacokinetics by affecting naproxen's absorption, distribution, and excretion, impacting its bioavailability and systemic clearance.
