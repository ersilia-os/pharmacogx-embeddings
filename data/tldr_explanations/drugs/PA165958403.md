Chenodeoxycholic acid's metabolism and therapeutic efficacy are significantly influenced by genetic interactions involving CYP3A4, which affects its metabolic rate, and UGT2B7, impacting its clearance and detoxification. Additionally, the drug's pharmacodynamics are modulated by nuclear receptors such as NR1H4 and NR1I2, which regulate cholesterol synthesis and drug metabolism pathways, along with GPBAR1 and AKR1C2 that govern bile acid signaling and steroid metabolism, respectively. These genetic variations can lead to differences in treatment outcomes and adverse effects.
