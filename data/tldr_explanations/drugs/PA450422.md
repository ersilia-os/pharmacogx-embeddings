Methimazole's metabolism and subsequent efficacy and toxicity are influenced by genetic polymorphisms in several cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, and FMO3. Variations in these genes can affect the drug's metabolic rate, resulting in altered serum concentrations, differential therapeutic outcomes, and varying risk profiles for adverse effects, with specific alleles in enzymes like CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 potentially leading to higher drug concentrations that may both enhance efficacy and increase the likelihood of side effects.
