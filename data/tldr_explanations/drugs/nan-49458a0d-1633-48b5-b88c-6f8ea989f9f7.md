Terizidone, similarly to cycloserine, might have its efficacy and safety influenced by pharmacogenetic factors such as metabolism by aldehyde dehydrogenases (e.g., ALDH1A1, ALDH2) and transport via members of the SLC and ABC transporter families like SLC22A1 and ABCB1. These genetic interactions can affect Terizidone's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics by altering drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination.
