The efficacy and safety of 5-HTP in treating symptoms like anxiety and mood swings are influenced by genetic variations in several serotonin modulating genes. The SLC6A4 gene affects serotonin reuptake, potentially altering 5-HTP pharmacokinetics, while variations in HTR2A and HTR3A genes can modify how 5-HTP stimulates serotonin receptors, affecting its pharmacodynamic response. Additionally, the SLC22A2 gene, involved in organic cation transport, could influence 5-HTP's cellular uptake and distribution, contributing to interindividual differences in drug response.
