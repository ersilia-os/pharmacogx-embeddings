Genetic polymorphisms in the CES1 gene affect the hydrolysis and activation of the prodrug dabigatran, while variants in the ABCB1 gene influence the drug's plasma levels through changes in the activity of the P-glycoprotein transporter. Additionally, genetic variability in UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes like UGT1A9, UGT2B15, and UGT2B7 can alter the clearance of dabigatran, affecting both its therapeutic efficacy and risk of adverse effects such as bleeding.
