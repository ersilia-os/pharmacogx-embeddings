Sevoflurane's metabolism involves primarily CYP2E1, and to lesser extents CYP2B6, CYP2A6, and CYP3A4, with genetic variations in these enzymes potentially affecting the rate of metabolism which can influence drug sensitivity and toxicity risks, such as renal-affecting fluoride ion release. Additionally, genetic variants in the GABA_A receptor subunits targeted by Sevoflurane may alter its pharmacodynamic effects, influencing the depth and duration of anesthesia.
