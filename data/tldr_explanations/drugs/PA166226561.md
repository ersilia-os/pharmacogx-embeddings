The genetic variability in CYP2B6, including alleles like CYP2B6*6, influences the metabolism of bupropion into its primary active metabolite, hydroxybupropion, causing differences in drug plasma levels and thereby affecting its efficacy and side effect profile. Variations in enzyme activity lead to varied pharmacodynamic outcomes due to altered levels of hydroxybupropion, which maintains the pharmacological properties of bupropion, influencing the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine.
