The effectiveness of Temozolomide (TMZ) in treating tumors is significantly affected by the MGMT gene, where the methylation status of the MGMT promoter determines the expression of the MGMT enzyme, impacting the repair of TMZ-induced DNA damage and consequently tumor sensitivity to the drug. Additionally, pharmacokinetics influenced by genes such as ABCB1 and ABCG2, which encode proteins involved in drug transport, alter TMZ's distribution and clearance, further affecting the drug's therapeutic efficacy and side effects.
