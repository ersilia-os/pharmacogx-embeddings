Azacitidine's effectiveness and safety are influenced by its interaction with the CDA gene, which encodes cytidine deaminase responsible for the drug's metabolism, and DNMT1, the target enzyme inhibited by azacitidine affecting DNA methylation. Variations in these genes can alter drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, influencing efficacy and toxicity in treating myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. Additionally, mutations in genes like PTPN11, CBL, NRAS, KRAS, TYMS, MTHFR, and XRCC1, which are involved in oncogenic pathways and DNA synthesis and repair, may also modify treatment outcomes through effects on cancer pathology and drug resistance mechanisms.
