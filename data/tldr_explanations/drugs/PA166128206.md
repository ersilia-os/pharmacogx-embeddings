Metamizole is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are responsible for the transformation of the drug into active metabolites such as MAA and AA, with genetic variants in these enzymes potentially leading to variations in drug efficacy and safety. Additionally, NAT2, involved in drug acetylation, influences metamizole metabolism and side effects like agranulocytosis through genetically determined fast or slow acetylator phenotypes.
