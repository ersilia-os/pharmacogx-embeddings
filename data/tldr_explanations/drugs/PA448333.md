Alprazolam's metabolism is significantly affected by variants in the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, leading to variability in how quickly the drug is processed in the body. This impacts alprazolam's efficacy and safety, where increased enzyme activity can lead to reduced effectiveness, and decreased activity can result in higher, potentially toxic drug concentrations. These differences guide adjustments in dosage to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects for treating anxiety and panic disorders.
