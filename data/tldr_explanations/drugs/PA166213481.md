The gene UGT1A1 significantly influences the metabolic rate of raloxifene through its role in the transformation of the drug into raloxifene-4â€²-glucuronide by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes. Variations, or polymorphisms, in UGT1A1 can lead to different levels of the drug and its metabolite in the body, thereby affecting both the efficacy and safety of raloxifene by altering how quickly it is metabolized and eliminated.
