The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dextroamphetamine are significantly influenced by genetic variations: CYP2D6 affects its metabolism, where variations can alter drug clearance rates leading to different therapeutic outcomes; genes such as SLC6A3 and DRD1 impact its effects on dopamine pathways, thereby affecting the drugâ€™s effectiveness in managing ADHD symptoms.
