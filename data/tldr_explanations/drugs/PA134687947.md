Eletriptan, a drug for acute migraines, metabolizes chiefly via CYP3A4, with contributions from CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2A6. Gene variations, especially in CYP3A4, affect its metabolism, influencing drug efficacy and safety. Eletriptan is also influenced by the P-glycoprotein transporter (ABCB1 gene) in terms of absorption and elimination, and interactions with the GNB3 gene's rs5443 SNP can predict treatment responses, impacting its clinical effects.
