Sitagliptin's interactions with metabolic enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C8, as well as transporters ABCB1 and SLC22A8, substantially influence its pharmacokinetics by affecting the drug's plasma levels, absorption, and renal excretion. Additionally, genetic variations in the GLP1R gene could impact the drug’s therapeutic efficacy through alterations in the incretin response, which is central to sitagliptin’s glucose-lowering effect.
