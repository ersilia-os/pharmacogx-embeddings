Chlorothiazide targets the SLC12A3 gene, which encodes the Na-Cl cotransporter in kidney tubules, enhancing excretion of sodium and chloride to exert its diuretic effect, while variations in this gene impact its efficacy in managing blood pressure and fluid retention. Additionally, chlorothiazide inhibits enzymes encoded by the CA1/CA2 genes, affecting electrolyte and fluid balance, and altering vascular responses which contribute to its antihypertensive effects; genetic differences in these genes can modify the drug's effectiveness.
