Deutetrabenazine's pharmacogenetic interactions primarily involve the genes SLC18A2, CBR1, CBR3, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4/5, with SLC18A2 crucial for its mechanism of action by inhibiting VMAT2 to reduce neurotransmitter release, aiding in the treatment of movement disorders. Variations in CYP2D6 significantly affect deutetrabenazine metabolism and patient response, influencing the formation of its active metabolites α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ, thus impacting both efficacy and potential adverse effects, which calls for personalized dosing strategies based on individual genetic makeup.
