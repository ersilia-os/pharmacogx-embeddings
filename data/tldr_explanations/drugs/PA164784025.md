Entecavir, an antiviral medication for chronic hepatitis B, does not significantly interact with human liver enzymes such as those in the cytochrome P450 system, hence demonstrating minimal pharmacokinetic interactions. However, pharmacogenetic factors like variations in genes such as IFNL4 and IFNL3, which are related to interferon lambda and influence immune responses and viral clearance, could affect how the immune system reacts to treatment with entecavir, influencing its pharmacodynamics rather than its pharmacokinetics.
