Prilocaine's effectiveness and safety are influenced by its interaction with the SCN5A gene, which affects the sensitivity of nerve cells to the drug's sodium channel blocking action, and the G6PD gene, where deficiency might increase the risk of methemoglobinemia, a serious side effect where hemoglobin is unable to efficiently carry oxygen. These genetic factors necessitate tailored prilocaine administration strategies to mitigate potential adverse reactions in susceptible individuals.
