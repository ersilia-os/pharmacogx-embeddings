Afatinib's pharmacogenetic interactions are primarily determined by variations in the EGFR gene, with sensitizing mutations like exon 19 deletions and the L858R substitution in exon 21 enhancing drug response, and resistance mutations such as T790M reducing efficacy in NSCLC treatment. Further, while not detailed, the pharmacokinetic behavior of afatinib might be affected by polymorphisms in efflux transporter genes like ABCB1 and ABCG2, altering drug levels and responses.
