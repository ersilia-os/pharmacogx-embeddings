Variations in the EGFR gene, specifically exon 19 deletions or the exon 21 L858R substitution, enhance the sensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to dacomitinib, making it an effective treatment option. Furthermore, genetic variants in metabolic enzymes like CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and transporters such as ABCB1 and ABCG2 influence the metabolism and tissue distribution of dacomitinib, affecting drug exposure and patient response, which assists in individualizing therapy to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity.
