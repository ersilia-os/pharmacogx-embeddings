Sulfamethoxazole metabolism is influenced by NAT2 and CYP2C9 gene polymorphisms, which affect its pharmacokinetics through N-acetylation and oxidation processes, respectively. NAT2 gene variations categorize individuals as slow or rapid acetylators, impacting drug efficacy and side effects such as hypersensitivity or hemolytic anemia, while CYP2C9 variations alter drug oxidation rates. Additionally, G6PD polymorphisms affect sulfamethoxazole sensitivity, particularly in relation to oxidative stress-induced hemolytic anemia, marking a vital consideration for therapeutic strategies and dosing adjustments.
