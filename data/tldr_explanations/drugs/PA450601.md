Nedocromil's effectiveness in treating asthma is influenced by genetic variations in its target genes—CYSLTR1, CYSLTR2, PTGDR, FPR1, and HSP90AA1—which impact cellular responses such as leukotriene receptor function, prostaglandin D2 signaling, peptide-mediated inflammation, and protein folding. These genetic differences can lead to variability in how individuals respond to the drug, affecting its anti-inflammatory efficacy and individual therapeutic outcomes.
