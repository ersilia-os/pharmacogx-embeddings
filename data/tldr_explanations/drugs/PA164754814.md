Pregabalin's pharmacogenetics are significantly influenced by genetic variations in the SLC1A1 and SLC7A5 transporter genes, which play crucial roles in the drug's absorption, distribution, and elimination, thereby affecting its efficacy and safety profiles. While the drug's interaction with metabolic enzymes is minimal, these transporters impact pregabalin's pharmacokinetic characteristics, and variations in these genes can lead to individual differences in drug levels.
