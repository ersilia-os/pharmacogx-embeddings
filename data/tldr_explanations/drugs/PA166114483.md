Lumacaftor works by targeting the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene, which helps stabilize and improve the function of the mutated protein crucial for chloride transport in cystic fibrosis patients. It is metabolized by several enzymes including CYP3A4, CYP2B6, and others, and interacts with proteins such as ABCB1 and SLC26A9; variations in these genes influence lumacaftor's metabolism, distribution, and efficacy, affecting therapeutic outcomes.
