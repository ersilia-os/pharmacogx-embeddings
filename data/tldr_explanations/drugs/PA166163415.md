The effectiveness and safety of velpatasvir, a drug used in treating hepatitis C, are significantly influenced by genetic variations in metabolic enzymes (CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4) and transporters (ABCB1, ABCG2, SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, and SLCO2B1). Polymorphisms in these genes can alter the drug's metabolism and transport, impacting its plasma concentrations, which may affect therapeutic outcomes and potential toxicity, thereby necessitating tailored dosing and monitoring.
