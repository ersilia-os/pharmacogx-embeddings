The pharmacogenetics of mefloquine is influenced by variations in genes such as CYP3A4, which affects the drug's metabolism rate and could lead to variable plasma concentrations and neuropsychiatric side effects. Additionally, polymorphisms in the ABCB1 gene impact the drug's distribution and elimination, while genetic factors like G6PD deficiency can enhance sensitivity to oxidative stress induced by malaria, all of which potentially modify the therapeutic outcomes and side effects of mefloquine.
