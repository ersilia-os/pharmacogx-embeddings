The pharmacogenetic interactions of uric acid are primarily associated with its transport through solute carriers like SLC22A6, SLC22A8, and SLC2A9, which govern the renal excretion and reabsorption of uric acid, thus affecting its plasma levels and influence on diseases like gout and its role in neuroprotection during stroke. Variations in these genes alter uric acid levels, impacting the pharmacokinetics of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, influencing disease risk, progression, and response to therapies.
