Asunaprevir's metabolism is significantly influenced by genetic variations in enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, with polymorphic variants affecting drug metabolism and plasma levels, potentially impacting its efficacy and toxicity. Additionally, genetic polymorphisms in transporters SLCO1B1 and ABCB1, which facilitate drug uptake and efflux, can alter the bioavailability, therapeutic effectiveness, and safety profile of asunaprevir.
