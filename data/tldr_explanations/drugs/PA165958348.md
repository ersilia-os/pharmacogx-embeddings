Indacaterol's effectiveness and tolerability are influenced by genetic variations in ADRB2, which affect its bronchodilatory efficacy, and in the metabolic enzymes CYP3A4 and UGT1A1, which alter the drug's plasma levels and clearance rates. These genetic factors can lead to clinical variability in therapeutic responses among patients, necessitating adjusted dosing regimens or precautions based on individual genetic profiles.
