Sulfanilamide, a sulfonamide antibiotic, functions by inhibiting bacterial dihydropteroate synthase, an enzyme crucial for folic acid synthesis in bacteria. The drug's interaction with the human G6PD gene, which encodes for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, does not directly alter sulfanilamide's pharmacological action but is significant for patient risk assessment due to the potential for hemolytic anemia induced by oxidative stress from such medications in individuals with G6PD deficiency.
