Mephedrone's pharmacodynamic effects may relate to monoamine-related genes such as SLC6A4, which encodes the serotonin transporter, influenced by its role in enhancing monoamine neurotransmitter release and inhibiting reuptake. Additionally, variations in genes like CYP2D6, which may impact mephedrone's metabolism, could modify how individuals are affected by the drug, though direct research confirming these pharmacogenetic interactions is lacking.
