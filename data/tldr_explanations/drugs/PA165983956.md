Acetaminophen metabolism involves critical pharmacogenetic interactions primarily with the CYP2E1 enzyme that produces the hepatotoxic metabolite NAPQI and the glutathione S-transferases (GSTM1 and GSTT1) that help detoxify NAPQI. Genetic variations in these enzymes affect the rate of NAPQI production and detoxification, influencing liver toxicity risk, especially under conditions of high dosage or concurrent alcohol consumption that induce CYP2E1 activity.
