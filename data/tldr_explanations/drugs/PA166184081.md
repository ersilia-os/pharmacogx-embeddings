Nicorandil, used to treat chronic stable angina, interacts primarily with the ABCC9 gene, which is responsible for encoding components of ATP-sensitive potassium channels in cardiac and vascular smooth muscles. Variants in ABCC9 can affect the function of these channels, thereby impacting the drug's efficacy and safety by altering the flux of potassium ions across the cellular membranes, which influences membrane potential and muscle relaxation.
