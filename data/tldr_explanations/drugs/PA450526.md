Mitoxantrone's metabolism and clearance are influenced by genes such as CYP1B1, CYP3A4, and CYP2E1, which affect its toxicity and therapeutic effectiveness through variations in oxidative metabolism rates among individuals. On the pharmacodynamics side, genetic variants in ABCB1, ABCC1, and ABCG2 impact the drug's distribution, excretion, and cellular concentration, respectively, altering mitoxantroneâ€™s effectiveness and contributing to differential drug resistance profiles in cancer treatments.
