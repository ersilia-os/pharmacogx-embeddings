Variations in the genes CYP3A4, ABCB1, and ABCG2 significantly impact the metabolism, transport, bioavailability, and elimination of the drug venetoclax, which is used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other hematologic malignancies. Genetic polymorphisms in these genes require careful dose management to prevent toxicity and ensure therapeutic efficacy, while variations in the BCL2 gene, though less established, could theoretically influence treatment outcomes due to its role in the drug's mechanism.
