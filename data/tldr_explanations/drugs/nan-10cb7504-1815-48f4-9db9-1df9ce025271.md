Bedaquiline's effectiveness and safety are influenced by variations in the CYP3A4 gene, which affect the drug's metabolism. Individuals with genetic variants that either enhance or reduce CYP3A4 enzyme activity may experience either reduced efficacy or increased risk of adverse effects like QT prolongation, respectively. This necessitates consideration of dose adjustments or thorough monitoring to balance therapeutic benefits and risks.
