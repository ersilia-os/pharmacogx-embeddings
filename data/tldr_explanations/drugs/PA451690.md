Timolol metabolism is significantly influenced by genetic polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genes, where CYP2D6 plays a primary role. Variants that cause poor metabolism in CYP2D6 can lead to higher plasma levels of Timolol, increasing the risk of side effects like bradycardia or respiratory issues during systemic use for cardiovascular purposes, while ultra-rapid metabolizers may require higher doses for therapeutic effectiveness. Although CYP2C19 also affects Timolol's metabolism, its impact is less pronounced, and genetic variations in this gene may require dosage adjustments.
