Genetic variations in the CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 enzymes affect the metabolism of chlorpropamide, a drug used to manage Type 2 diabetes. Variants such as CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 decrease enzyme activity, resulting in slower drug metabolism and higher plasma concentrations, which increases the risk of hypoglycemia; thus, monitoring these genetic variations is important for appropriate dosing to avoid toxicity. Additionally, G6PD deficiency may heighten the risk of hemolytic anemia when using this medication.
