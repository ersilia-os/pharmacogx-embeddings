Hydrocodone's interaction with the enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 and the OPRM1 opioid receptor gene significantly impacts its metabolism and effects. Variations in CYP2D6 affect the conversion of hydrocodone into hydromorphone, influencing pain control, while differences in CYP3A4 alter drug clearance. Additionally, genetic differences in OPRM1 can modify the sensitivity to hydrocodone's analgesic and euphoric effects, thus impacting its overall therapeutic efficacy and side-effect profile.
