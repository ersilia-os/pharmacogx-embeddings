Thalidomide's pharmacogenetic effects involve its metabolism by enzymes such as CYP2C19, which affects the formation of metabolites influencing drug safety and efficacy, and its interaction with the cereblon protein (CRBN), which modulates its therapeutic action, particularly in conditions like multiple myeloma. Variations in genes like CYP2C19 and CRBN can lead to differences in drug metabolism and effectiveness, thereby impacting individual therapeutic outcomes and side effect profiles.
