Cavosonstat, designed to treat cystic fibrosis patients with the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene, may have its efficacy and safety influenced by variations in the CFTR gene itself, primarily impacting pharmacodynamics due to the gene's role in protein function which the drug aims to modulate. The absence of specific interaction data makes it hard to determine how other pharmacokinetic genes might affect Cavosonstatâ€™s action.
