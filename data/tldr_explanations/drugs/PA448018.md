Acetazolamide interacts pharmacogenetically mainly through the modulation of carbonic anhydrase isoforms (CA1, CA2, CA3, CA4, CA7, CA12, CA14) affecting its pharmacodynamics, while its pharmacokinetics involve CYP3A4, crucial for its metabolism, and SLC22A6, an organic anion transporter important for renal clearance. Genetic variations in CYP3A4 and SLC22A6 can modify the drug's metabolism and excretion rates, respectively, impacting the drugâ€™s efficacy and side-effect profile.
