The pharmacogenetics of deferasirox involves key enzymes like UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, which are crucial for its glucuronidation and clearance, as well as CYP1A2, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4 which impact drug levels through metabolism. Additionally, transporter proteins such as ABCC2 and ABCG2, along with the VDR gene, influence the drugâ€™s pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety through their roles in drug excretion and metabolic pathways, suggesting the potential for personalized dosing based on genetic differences.
