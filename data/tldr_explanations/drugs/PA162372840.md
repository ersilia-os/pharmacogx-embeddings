Sunitinib's pharmacogenetic interactions are primarily mediated by metabolic genes, such as CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, and transport proteins like ABCG2, ABCB1, ABCC2, and ABCC4. Variants in these genes can impact sunitinib's plasma levels, metabolism, and efflux, affecting the drug's efficacy, toxicity, and overall bioavailability, thereby necessitating tailored therapeutic approaches based on individual genetic profiles.
