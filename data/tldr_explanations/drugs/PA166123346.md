The UGT1A1 gene, crucial in bilirubin metabolism through its role in glucuronidating unconjugated bilirubin, also influences the metabolism of drugs like irinotecan due to polymorphisms such as the UGT1A1*28 allele which can reduce enzyme activity and lead to higher levels of unconjugated bilirubin. This necessitates clinical considerations for adjusting drug dosages to prevent toxicity. The potential role of SOD2 in bilirubin metabolism remains speculative, linked indirectly through its function in oxidative stress defense and liver health.
