The pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of dihydrocodeine are significantly influenced by the CYP2D6 gene, which is responsible for converting dihydrocodeine into its more potent metabolite, dihydromorphine. Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6 can lead to varying enzyme activities, affecting drug efficacy and potential toxicity, while the CYP3A4 gene's role in producing less active metabolites also influences the overall drug metabolism but has a lesser impact on efficacy.
