Genetic variations in enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 affect the metabolism of lopinavir, a protease inhibitor used in HIV treatment, influencing its plasma concentration and effectiveness, with underactive enzyme variants leading to higher plasma levels and potential adverse effects. Additionally, polymorphisms in the ABCB1 gene, encoding P-glycoprotein, affect lopinavirâ€™s absorption and distribution, highlighting the importance of personalized dosing based on individual genetic profiles to optimize treatment outcomes.
