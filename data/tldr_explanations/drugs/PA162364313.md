Bezafibrate's interactions are influenced by genetic variants in PPAR genes (PPARA, PPARG, PPARD) which affect its efficacy in modulating lipid levels, and by polymorphisms in metabolic enzymes (CYP1A1, CYP2C8, CYP3A4) and the transporter gene SLCO1B1 that alter the drug's metabolism and plasma concentrations, impacting its overall effectiveness and safety.
