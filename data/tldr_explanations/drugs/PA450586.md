Naloxone's effectiveness in reversing opioid effects is influenced by the OPRM1 gene, which encodes the Mu-type opioid receptor where naloxone acts, with genetic variations potentially affecting receptor affinity and necessitating dosage adjustments. Furthermore, the metabolic process of naloxone is affected by variations in the UGT1A1, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19 genes, impacting its clearance and potentially requiring dose modifications to achieve effective plasma levels.
