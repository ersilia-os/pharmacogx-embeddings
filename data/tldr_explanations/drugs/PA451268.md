Rofecoxib's effectiveness and safety are largely influenced by genetic variations in PTGS2, its primary target, and CYP450 enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 that are involved in its metabolism. These genetic differences can affect the drug’s plasma levels and side-effect profiles, while variations in PTGS1 and transporter gene ABCC4 could modify risks of adverse cardiovascular events and influence the drug’s distribution within the body, respectively.
