Diltiazem metabolism is significantly affected by polymorphisms in the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 genes, impacting the oxidation process and altering the drug's plasma levels and safety profile. Variants in the ABCB1 gene also alter diltiazem's absorption and distribution, while polymorphisms in the ADRB1 gene can influence the heart rate response to the drug, which is crucial for conditions like atrial fibrillation, indicating the potential need for tailored dosages based on individual genetic makeup.
