Infigratinib's effectiveness in treating cholangiocarcinoma depends critically on FGFR2 gene alterations, necessitating genetic screening due to its significant pharmacogenetic interaction. Additionally, its pharmacokinetics are influenced by gene variations in CYP3A4, which affects metabolism, and in ABCB1 and ABCG2, which modify drug distribution, excretion, and plasma concentrations.
