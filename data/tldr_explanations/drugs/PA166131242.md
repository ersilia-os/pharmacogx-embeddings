The pharmacogenetics of 3-hydroxycotinine glucuronide involves the enzymes UGT1A4 and possibly UGT2B10, which are responsible for converting 3-hydroxycotinine into its glucuronide form, facilitating nicotine metabolite clearance via genetic polymorphisms that affect enzyme activity and glucuronidation efficiency. This variation influences how quickly nicotine metabolites are cleared from the body, focusing exclusively on pharmacokinetic interactions due to the lack of pharmacodynamic activity of 3-hydroxycotinine glucuronide as it does not interact with biological targets.
