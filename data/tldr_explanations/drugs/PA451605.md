Telmisartan's pharmacogenetic interactions involve genetic variations in metabolic enzyme UGT1A3, which affect the drug's conjugation and clearance, and transporter genes SLCO1B3 and ABCB1, which influence its hepatic uptake and efflux, thereby impacting its plasma concentrations, bioavailability, and possibly pharmacodynamics. Additionally, variations in GNB3 may affect telmisartan's pharmacodynamics related to cardiovascular functions, with overall implications for the drug's efficacy and safety.
