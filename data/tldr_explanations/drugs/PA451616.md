Terbutaline's efficacy and safety are influenced by genetic variations in the ADRB2 gene, which affect its bronchodilatory function, as well as in metabolic genes like SULT2A1, SULT1A1, UGT1A1, and UGT1A4, which impact its plasma concentration and side effect profiles through altered drug metabolism. Additionally, genetic polymorphisms in transporters SLC22A5 and SLC22A2 can change cellular uptake and distribution, affecting the drug's pharmacokinetics.
