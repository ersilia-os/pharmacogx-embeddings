Variants in genes such as CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and SLCO1B1 directly influence the metabolism and transport of abiraterone, affecting its efficacy and toxicity by altering drug metabolism rates and plasma levels. Additionally, non-pharmacokinetic genes like HSD3B1 and others indirectly impact treatment outcomes by affecting biological pathways involved in prostate cancer and response to hormone levels, thereby influencing the response to abiraterone treatment in prostate cancer therapies sensitive to androgen levels.
