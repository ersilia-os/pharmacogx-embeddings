The gene CYP2D6 is crucial in the pharmacogenetics of o-desmethyltramadol, the active metabolite of tramadol, as it affects the drug's metabolic rate through genetic variations ranging from poor to ultrarapid metabolizers. Such variability can significantly influence the therapeutic efficacy and potential side effects, with poor metabolizers experiencing less pain relief and ultrarapid metabolizers at increased risk of side effects. Other genes such as SULT1A3 and SLC22A1 are suggested to be involved in further metabolism and excretion, though their specific roles require deeper investigation.
