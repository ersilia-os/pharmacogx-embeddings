Gilteritinib's effectiveness and safety for treating AML are influenced by variations in the FLT3 gene, which determine the drugâ€™s targetability, and by polymorphisms in CYP3A4, ABCB1, and ABCG2 genes that affect its metabolism, absorption, and excretion. These genetic interactions significantly impact both the pharmacodynamics, with FLT3 mutations influencing efficacy as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and the pharmacokinetics involving the ADME properties of gilteritinib.
