Fluorouracil's metabolism and risk of toxicity are significantly influenced by the DPYD gene, where polymorphisms such as rs3918290 and rs55886062 can reduce enzyme activity needed for the drug's catabolism. On the pharmacodynamic side, efficacy is impacted by the TYMS gene, which is involved in DNA synthesis inhibition, and other pharmacogenetic interactions occur with genes like GSTP1 and UMPS, which affect toxicity and drug effectiveness, respectively.
