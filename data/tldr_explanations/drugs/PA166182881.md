Migalastat works effectively as a pharmacological chaperone for treating Fabry disease only in the presence of specific mutations in the GLA gene, termed "amenable variants." These variants affect the structural compatibility of the drug with the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A, facilitating its proper folding and transport to the lysosome, crucial for its therapeutic action in degrading glycosphingolipids.
