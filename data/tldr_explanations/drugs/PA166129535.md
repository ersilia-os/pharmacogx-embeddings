Mizolastine is metabolized by the enzyme CYP2D6, and genetic variations in the CYP2D6 gene can significantly alter the drug's pharmacokinetics, affecting its efficacy and safety. Poor metabolizers may have higher blood levels and increased risk of adverse effects due to slower metabolism, while ultrarapid metabolizers may experience reduced effectiveness due to faster drug clearance.
