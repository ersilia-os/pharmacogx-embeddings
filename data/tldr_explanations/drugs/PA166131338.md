Tamoxifen-N-glucuronide is formed mainly through the action of the UGT1A4 enzyme, which catalyzes the addition of glucuronic acid to Tamoxifen, aiding its excretion and affecting its pharmacokinetic profile. Genetic variations in UGT1A4 can alter the rate of this process, influencing the levels of active Tamoxifen metabolites such as endoxifen, thereby impacting the efficacy and toxicity of Tamoxifen therapy.
