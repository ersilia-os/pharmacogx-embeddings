Homoharringtonine, used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia, may have variable treatment outcomes influenced by genetic variations in the ribosomal subunits and proteins like ABL1 and BCR, which are critical due to their involvement in the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein impacting drug sensitivity. Additionally, the ABCB1 gene affects the drugâ€™s pharmacokinetics by regulating the efflux of the drug out of cells, which can indirectly modify its effectiveness.
