Bumetanide's effectiveness and side effects are influenced by genetic variations in the PTGS2 gene, affecting its metabolism, and in the SLC22A6, SLC22A8, and SLC10A1 genes, impacting its renal excretion. These genetic differences may lead to variability in plasma levels of the drug, consequently affecting both its efficacy and toxicity.
