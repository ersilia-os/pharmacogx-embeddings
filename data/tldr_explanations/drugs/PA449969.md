The metabolism of imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, is significantly influenced by the genetic variants of the CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 enzymes. Variability in CYP2D6 can alter the bioavailability of imipramine and its metabolite desipramine, leading to potentially higher plasma concentrations and increased adverse effects in poor metabolizers, while CYP2C19 variants affect the drug's metabolic rate and plasma levels, impacting therapeutic outcomes. This necessitates personalized dosing to enhance efficacy and minimize side effects based on individual genetic profiles.
