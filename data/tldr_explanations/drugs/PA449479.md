The drug epoprostenol's efficacy and safety are influenced by genetic variations in PTGIS, PTGIR, and potentially PTGS2. PTGIS is crucial for synthesizing prostacyclin from arachidonic acid, affecting drug levels and response, while PTGIR mediates the drug effects on smooth muscle relaxation and platelet function through cyclic AMP, with genetic variations potentially impacting therapeutic efficacy. PTGS2, though less directly involved, could also influence the prostaglandin pathway, affecting the drugâ€™s overall effects.
