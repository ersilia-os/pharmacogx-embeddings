Lorazepam metabolism is significantly influenced by the UGT2B15 gene, where genetic variants can slow metabolism leading to prolonged drug effects and heightened side effects like excessive sedation. Other enzymes such as CYP2C8 and UGT2B7 also affect its metabolism to a lesser degree, with CYP2C8 making a minor contribution and UGT2B7 assisting in glucuronidation alongside UGT2B15.
