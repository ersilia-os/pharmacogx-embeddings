Variations in genes such as DDC, which is responsible for converting levodopa into dopamine, along with dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3), influence the effectiveness of levodopa therapy in treating Parkinson's disease. Additional genetic factors like SLC22A1, which affects drug distribution, and non-enzyme genes like DBH and SLC6A3 that influence dopamine synthesis and reuptake, as well as HOMER1 which plays a regulatory role in neuronal signaling, further impact levodopaâ€™s efficacy and side effects, necessitating a personalized approach to its use.
