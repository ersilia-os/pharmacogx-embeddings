Topotecan pharmacokinetics is influenced by genetic variations in the ABCG2 and ABCB1 genes, which affect the drug's efflux and hence its intracellular levels, impacting overall efficacy and toxicity. Similarly, variations in SLC47A1 and SLC47A2 genes alter topotecan clearance, influencing both pharmacokinetics and patient response.
