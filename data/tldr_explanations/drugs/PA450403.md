The metabolism of methamphetamine is significantly influenced by the genetic variants of the enzyme CYP2D6, which affect the drug's plasma levels, efficacy, and risk of adverse effects, with poor metabolizer variants possibly leading to increased toxicity and dependence. Additionally, genetic differences in neurotransmitter transporter genes (SLC6A3, SLC6A4, SLC6A2) and PICK1 affect individual responses to methamphetamine by altering neurotransmitter reuptake and synaptic levels, which can impact addiction risk and therapeutic outcomes.
