Milnacipran, an SNRI, targets neurotransmitter transporters such as SLC6A4 and SLC6A2 affecting serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, and interacts with NMDA receptor subtypes (GRIN1, GRIN2A, etc.), possibly affecting glutamatergic neurotransmission. It is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and other CYP enzymes (CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2J2), where genetic variations can influence drug metabolism and patient response, indicating a potential need for personalized dosage adjustments based on these genetic factors.
