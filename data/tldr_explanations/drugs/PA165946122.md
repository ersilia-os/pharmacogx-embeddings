Gene variants in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 affect the metabolism of crizotinib, with the presence of the CYP3A5*1 allele leading to faster drug metabolism, possibly necessitating dose adjustments. Additionally, polymorphisms in ABCB1, which encodes for the P-glycoprotein efflux transporter, impact how crizotinib is distributed within cells, affecting its efficacy and side effects, such as hepatotoxicity and gastrointestinal issues. Furthermore, the effectiveness of crizotinib depends on targeting specific gene alterations like the EML4-ALK fusion in tumors, thereby guiding the use of the drug in treatments.
