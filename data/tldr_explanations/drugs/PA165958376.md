The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine, a prodrug metabolized into 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine primarily via plasma esterases and then by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, are significantly influenced by genetic variations in CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Variations in CYP2D6 can lead to different rates of metabolism, affecting the drug's efficacy and safety, while CYP3A4 variations alter drug exposure and effectiveness. These genetic interactions affect how the active metabolite acts on muscarinic receptors involved in bladder contraction, impacting both drug concentration and pharmacodynamics.
