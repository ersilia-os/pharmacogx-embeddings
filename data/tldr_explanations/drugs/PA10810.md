Pemetrexed pharmacogenetics involves the impact of genetic polymorphisms in various genes on the drug's uptake, metabolism, and effectiveness. Transporters such as SLC19A1 and ABCG2, and enzymes like DHFR, TYMS, GART, and ATIC influence how pemetrexed is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted, as well as how it interacts with target enzymes, affecting its antiproliferative effects and overall efficacy.
