The pharmacogenetic interactions of Alfentanil largely depend on its metabolism by the CYP3A family genes (CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7), where genetic variations can lead to altered enzyme activity affecting drug levels and safety. Furthermore, genetic polymorphisms in the ABCB1 gene, encoding the P-glycoprotein transporter, influence Alfentanil's distribution and clearance, thereby impacting its pharmacokinetics and overall effects, while variations in OPRM1, encoding opioid receptors, may modify the analgesic response to the drug.
