Boceprevir's metabolism is significantly influenced by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes, with genetic variants in these genes resulting in different enzyme activities and, therefore, altering drug metabolism. For instance, CYP3A5 expressers process the drug quicker which might require dose adjustments, whereas non-expressers may face higher drug exposure and potential adverse effects. Additionally, boceprevir is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, impacted by ABCB1 gene polymorphisms, affecting its distribution and elimination, and IFNL3 and IFNL4 gene variations can influence treatment response, including therapy duration and outcome in HCV treatment.
