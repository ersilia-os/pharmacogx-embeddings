Variations in the TYMS gene can affect the efficacy and toxicity of raltitrexed, an antimetabolite used in colorectal cancer, as these polymorphisms alter enzyme expression or activity, and thus influence the drug's ability to inhibit thymidylate synthase. Additionally, the genes encoding for the reduced folate carrier and folylpolyglutamate synthase (FPGS) are important as they modulate the pharmacokinetics of raltitrexed by affecting how the drug is transported into and retained in cells, respectively.
