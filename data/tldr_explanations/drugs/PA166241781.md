Isepamicin can cause pharmacogenetic interactions leading to ototoxicity, particularly in individuals with genetic mutations in mitochondrial genes MT-RNR1 and MT-ND1. These mutations increase mitochondrial vulnerability to the drug's effects, with MT-RNR1 impacting mitochondrial ribosomal functions related to hearing and MT-ND1 affecting the mitochondrial respiratory chain, thereby exacerbating the impact on sensory hair cells of the ear.
