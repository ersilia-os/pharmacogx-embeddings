Pegaptanib, a drug targeting the VEGFA gene, specifically binds to and inhibits VEGF165, reducing angiogenesis and vascular permeability associated with neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Genetic variations in VEGFA could potentially influence the effectiveness and safety of pegaptanib through its pharmacodynamic interactions, leading to variability in drug response among individuals.
