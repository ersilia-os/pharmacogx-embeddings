The metabolism and transport of clindamycin involve genes such as CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and ABCB1, with variations in these genes affecting the drug's plasma levels, toxicity, distribution, and systemic exposure. CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 are vital for converting clindamycin into inactive metabolites, and polymorphisms in these genes can alter metabolic rates, while ABCB1 affects the drug's efflux from cells, influencing its pharmacokinetics and potentially its overall efficacy and safety.
