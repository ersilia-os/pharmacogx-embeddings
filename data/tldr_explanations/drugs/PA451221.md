Raloxifene's effectiveness and safety are influenced by genetic variations in estrogen receptor genes (ESR1 and ESR2) which affect its pharmacodynamics, and in metabolic enzymes (UGT1A1 and UGT1A8) and transporters (SLCO1B1, ABCB1, ABCG2) which impact its pharmacokinetics, altering the drug's metabolism, bioavailability, and therapeutic outcomes. These gene-drug interactions highlight the critical role of individual genetic makeup in modulating both the effects and metabolism of raloxifene.
