Variants in the ADRB2 gene, such as Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu, impact the pharmacodynamics of salbutamol by altering the beta-2 adrenergic receptor's binding affinity or downregulation rate, influencing bronchodilation efficacy and side effects. The pharmacokinetics of salbutamol, primarily involving metabolism by CYP3A4, shows no direct interactions with the other genes listed, which relate more broadly to physiological pathways concerning lung function and inflammation.
