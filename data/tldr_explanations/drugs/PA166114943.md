Regorafenib's metabolism primarily involves liver enzymes CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, and glucuronidation enzymes UGT1A9 and UGT1A1, with genetic polymorphisms in CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 significantly influencing its pharmacokinetics. Furthermore, the transport of its active metabolites M-2 and M-5 by ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters can be affected by genetic variants in these genes, altering the drug's distribution and excretion, thereby affecting its effectiveness and toxicity profiles.
