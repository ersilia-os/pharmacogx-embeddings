Genetic variations in the CYP2D6 enzyme significantly influence the metabolism of viloxazine, affecting individual responses and plasma concentrations of the drug. Additionally, variations in the SLC47A1 transporter impact the excretion of viloxazine, which can modify drug levels and action duration, while potential involvement of UGT1A9 and UGT2B15 through glucuronidation may further affect its pharmacokinetics.
