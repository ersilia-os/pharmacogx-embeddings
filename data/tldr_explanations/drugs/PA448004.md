Abacavir, a drug used for HIV-1 treatment, interacts significantly with the HLA-B*57:01 allele and SNP rs2395029 in the HCP5 gene, both of which increase the risk of developing severe hypersensitivity reactions. These genetic factors are crucial in guiding preventive genetic testing and therapeutic decisions, although they are not involved in the drug's metabolism, which is primarily handled by ADH6 and UGT1A1.
