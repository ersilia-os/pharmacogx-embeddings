Venlafaxine's therapeutic efficacy and safety are influenced by genetic variations in key enzymes and transporters like CYP2D6, which metabolizes the drug into desvenlafaxine, and ABCB1, involved in the drug's efflux from cells. These genetic factors impact venlafaxine's plasma levels, distribution, and elimination, affecting both its effectiveness and side effect profile, which can necessitate personalized dose adjustments for optimal treatment outcomes.
