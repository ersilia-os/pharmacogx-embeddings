Telithromycin's metabolism by CYP3A4 and transport by SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3 is significantly influenced by genetic variations such as CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A4*22, and SLCO1B1*5, which impact its plasma levels, efficacy, and safety. Variants in these genes can lead to under-metabolism, increasing toxicity risk, or over-metabolism, which may reduce drug effectiveness, while altering drug distribution and elimination, thereby necessitating tailored management based on individual genetic profiles.
