Varenicline acts primarily on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, particularly through CHRNA4 and CHRNB2, and its efficacy and side effects can be influenced by genetic variants in these receptor genes. Additionally, variations in the SLC22A2 gene, responsible for the drug's renal excretion, can affect varenicline pharmacokinetics, impacting drug levels and elimination, thus modifying the clinical response or toxicity risk.
