Variants of the CYP2C19 gene affect the conversion of proguanil to its active metabolite cycloguanil, impacting the drug's plasma levels and therapeutic efficacy in malaria treatment. Additionally, genetic variability in DHFR, the target enzyme of cycloguanil, influences the drug's effectiveness and potential for resistance development among different Plasmodium species.
