Ethionamide, a drug used against tuberculosis, is metabolized in the liver with varying efficacy due to genetic variations in the FMO2 enzyme, which can affect its activation and thus its overall effectiveness. Additionally, Ethionamide's action on tuberculosis bacteria involves targeting specific bacterial enzymes like inhA and can be compromised by resistance mutations in katG, affecting its therapeutic efficacy and potential cross-resistance with similar drugs such as isoniazid.
