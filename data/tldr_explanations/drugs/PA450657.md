Nortriptyline metabolism is significantly influenced by genetic variations in CYP2D6, which primarily demethylates the drug, affecting its plasma levels and clinical efficacy or side effects. Other genes like CYP2C19 and ABCB1 also modulate its therapeutic responses by altering its metabolism and transport, whereas genes such as BDNF and ADRA2A are involved in pharmacodynamic responses, thereby influencing the drug's overall impact and adverse effects profile.
