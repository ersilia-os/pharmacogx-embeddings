Methoxsalen is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, and CYP2A13, and variations in the genes encoding these enzymes can affect the drug's metabolic rate, influencing its efficacy and safety. Genetic polymorphisms in these enzymes can lead to differences in Metoxsalen's metabolism, altering drug levels, therapeutic outcomes, and the risk of adverse effects.
