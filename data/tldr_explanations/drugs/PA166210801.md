The pharmacokinetics of ethylmorphine, a morphine derivative, are substantially affected by genetic variations in the CYP2D6 enzyme, responsible for its hepatic metabolism. Individuals with different CYP2D6 alleles demonstrate varied metabolization rates, ranging from poor to ultra-rapid, influencing the drug's effectiveness and safety by affecting its metabolism speed; thus, genetic testing may be necessary to tailor appropriate dosing strategies.
