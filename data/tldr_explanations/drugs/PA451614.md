Terbinafine metabolism is significantly impacted by genetic variations in cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP2C9, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19, which undertake processes like deamination, hydroxylation, and N-demethylation. Variants in these genes can alter drug metabolism rates, impacting terbinafine's efficacy and safety, leading to potential adverse effects like hepatotoxicity; additionally, interactions with HLA-A may influence immune-mediated adverse reactions, such as cutaneous effects.
