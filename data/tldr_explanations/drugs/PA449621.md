Fexofenadine's pharmacogenetics are influenced by interactions with transport proteins encoded by the ABCB1 and SLCO gene families, which affect the drugâ€™s absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Variants in these genes can lead to individual differences in the drug's levels and effectiveness through modulation of the P-glycoprotein and organic anion-transporting polypeptides, which govern cellular efflux and hepatic uptake respectively.
