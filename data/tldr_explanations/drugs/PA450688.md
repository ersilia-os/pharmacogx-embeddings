Olanzapine metabolism involves CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 enzymes, where genetic variations can affect drug pharmacokinetics and lead to differing plasma concentrations, impacting clearance and risk of adverse effects. Additionally, variations in neurotransmitter receptor genes like HTR2A and DRD2, and the ABCB1 gene related to the blood-brain barrier, influence olanzapine's efficacy and side effects by affecting drug distribution and response at the cellular level.
