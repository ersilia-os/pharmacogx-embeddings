Ciprofloxacin metabolism is heavily influenced by genetic variations in the CYP1A2 enzyme, where different polymorphisms can alter the drug's concentration by affecting metabolic rates, leading to variations in efficacy and safety. Variants reducing CYP1A2 activity can increase ciprofloxacin levels and toxicity risk, whereas variants enhancing enzyme function might decrease drug levels, reducing therapeutic effectiveness. Additionally, while not involved in ciprofloxacin metabolism, G6PD deficiencies can increase risks related to oxidative stress in patients using this drug, particularly at high or prolonged doses.
