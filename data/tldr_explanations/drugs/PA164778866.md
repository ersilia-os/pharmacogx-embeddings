Liothyronine's metabolism is significantly affected by UGT1A1, which aids in its conjugation and excretion, while its transport involves various SLCO and ABC transporters such as SLCO1A2, ABCB1, which can impact its absorption, distribution, and elimination due to genetic polymorphisms. Furthermore, genetic differences in thyroid hormone receptors THRA and THRB influence the pharmacodynamics of liothyronine, affecting its therapeutic effects on metabolic rates and growth development. These genetic interactions highlight how variations can lead to differing patient responses and guide personalized treatment strategies.
