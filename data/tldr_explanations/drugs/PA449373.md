Genetic variations in the enzymes CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, which are crucial for the metabolism of the Class Ia antiarrhythmic drug disopyramide, can significantly affect the drug's clearance and consequently its blood levels, potentially altering its efficacy and increasing toxicity risks. Moreover, genetic variants in the KCNH2 gene, which influences the function of the Kv11.1 protein involved in cardiac repolarization, can impact disopyramide's effectiveness in prolonging the QT interval, thus affecting its antiarrhythmic activity.
