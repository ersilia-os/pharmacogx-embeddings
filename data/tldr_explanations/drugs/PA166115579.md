Pamaquine, an antimalarial drug, interacts pharmacogenetically with the G6PD gene, which is crucial for protecting red blood cells from oxidative damage. Deficiencies in G6PD can lead to severe hemolytic anemia in individuals treated with pamaquine, due to the oxidative nature of the drug, highlighting a significant safety concern for those with this genetic susceptibility.
