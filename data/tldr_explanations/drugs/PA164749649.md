Dicloxacillin metabolism is significantly influenced by the CYP3A4 gene, which determines the activity of the enzyme crucial for its hepatic metabolism, impacting the drug's clearance, effectiveness, and potential toxicity. Additionally, genetic variations in the peptide transporters SLC15A1 and SLC15A2 affect dicloxacillinâ€™s absorption and bioavailability, while variations in albumin (ALB) could influence its distribution in the bloodstream.
