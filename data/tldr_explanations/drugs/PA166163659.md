Variations in the genes CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 significantly affect the metabolism of N-desmethylclozapine (norclozapine) and can markedly alter its therapeutic efficacy and side effects due to differences in norclozapine levels. Additionally, polymorphisms in other relevant enzymes like UGT2B10, CYP2C19, and UGT1A4 also influence norclozapine's pharmacokinetics, impacting its plasma concentration and effectiveness, thereby playing a crucial role in personalizing clozapine treatment to optimize efficacy and minimize side effects.
