Niraparib’s effectiveness and safety are influenced by genetic variations in multiple genes, such as BRCA1, BRCA2, PARP1, PARP2, CES1, ABCG2, and ABCB1. These genes affect the drug’s mechanism of action, metabolism, and disposition, with roles in DNA repair, drug targeting, and the pharmacokinetic profile, thus impacting individual therapeutic outcomes and necessitating personalized dosing strategies.
