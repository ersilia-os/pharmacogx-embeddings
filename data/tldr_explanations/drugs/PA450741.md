The pharmacogenetics of oxycodone involves its metabolism and receptor interactions, primarily affected by genetic variants in CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, ABCB1, and OPRM1 genes. CYP2D6 influences the conversion of oxycodone into the more potent oxymorphone, impacting clinical outcomes due to differences in enzyme activity among individuals, while CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 impact the drug's clearance. ABCB1 affects oxycodoneâ€™s distribution in the brain, and OPRM1 variants may alter how well oxycodone binds to opioid receptors, thereby affecting its analgesic effectiveness.
