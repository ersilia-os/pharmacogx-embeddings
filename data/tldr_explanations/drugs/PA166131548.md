The gene CYP2D6 plays a crucial role in metabolizing noroxymorphone, leading to variations in drug levels and effects among individuals, while genetic variants in OPRM1 influence how the mu-opioid receptor interacts with noroxymorphone, affecting pain relief and adverse effects. Given their roles in the metabolism and pharmacodynamics of oxymorphone, these genetic factors logically extend their influence to noroxymorphone, underscoring their importance in determining individual responses to the drug.
