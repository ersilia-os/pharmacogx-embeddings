Variations in genes such as SLC12A3, which encodes for the sodium-chloride symporter, and others related to renal transport like SLC22A6 (OAT1), SLC22A8 (OAT3), SLC22A11 (OAT4), and ABCC4 (MRP4), directly alter the effectiveness of hydrochlorothiazide by influencing its absorption, secretion, and the reabsorption capabilities of sodium and chloride in the kidneys. Other genes like KCNJ1, NEDD4L, and WNK1, which are involved in potassium and sodium balance, may also play a role, albeit more speculatively, in modulating the drug's diuretic effect and its impact on electrolyte management.
