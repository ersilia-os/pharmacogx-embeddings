Hydroxychloroquine metabolism is significantly affected by genetic polymorphisms in the enzymes CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP2C8, influencing the drug's levels and potential toxicity, while the efficacy can also vary based on genetic variations in these enzymes. Additionally, genetic variations in immune receptors like TLR7 and TLR9, as well as transporters such as ABCB1 and SLCO1A2, can influence the drug's pharmacodynamics, distribution, and excretion rates. G6PD genetic variations, while not involved in metabolism, can predispose individuals to hemolysis when taking hydroxychloroquine, highlighting the importance of considering genetic diversity when administering the drug.
