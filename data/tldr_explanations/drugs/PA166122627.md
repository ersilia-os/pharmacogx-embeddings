Chlorocresol, used as a preservative and antiseptic, might interact with the RYR1 gene, which regulates calcium channels in tissues. This potential interaction is theoretical and could influence intracellular calcium levels, affecting cellular responses in individuals sensitive to chlorocresol, especially during hypersensitivity reactions. This relationship is more inferential, considering the limited systemic absorption of chlorocresol.
