Probenecid's pharmacogenetic interactions mainly involve ABCB1, a gene that influences drug transport, affecting the distribution and elimination of Probenecid and co-administered drugs like Î²-lactam antibiotics. Additionally, while the interaction between Probenecid and the G6PD gene, which affects glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, is less direct, it could potentially influence metabolic balance, especially under stress or increased metabolic demand.
