Vortioxetine is metabolized primarily by the CYP2D6 enzyme, and genetic variations in this enzyme significantly influence the drugâ€™s plasma concentration, affecting its efficacy and safety. While other enzymes like CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C19 also participate in its metabolism, CYP2D6's role is crucial, and its genotyping could help customize treatment plans. Additionally, vortioxetine interacts with various serotonin receptors, which contributes to its pharmacodynamic profile, although the pharmacogenetic impact on these receptor interactions is less defined.
