Trastuzumab deruxtecan's efficacy and safety are influenced by genetic variations in the ERBB2 gene, which affects drug binding and internalization through HER2 expression levels, and CYP3A4, which impacts the metabolism of its cytotoxic component DXd, affecting both effectiveness and toxicity. Additionally, genes like ABCB1, SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, and ABCG2, involved in drug transport and excretion, are key to the drug's pharmacokinetic profile, influencing dosage optimization and therapeutic outcomes.
