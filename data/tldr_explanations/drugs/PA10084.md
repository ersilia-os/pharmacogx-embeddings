Fosamprenavir's pharmacogenetic interactions are significantly influenced by genetic variants in CYP3A4, an enzyme critical for metabolizing its active form, amprenavir. These variants can alter CYP3A4 activity, thereby affecting amprenavir's plasma concentrations and influencing either an increased risk of toxicity or reduced drug efficacy, which underscores the potential benefit of genotype-based dosing in treatment optimization.
