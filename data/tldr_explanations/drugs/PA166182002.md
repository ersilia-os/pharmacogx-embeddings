Amifampridine phosphate, used to treat Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome by enhancing acetylcholine release via voltage-gated potassium channels, generally does not involve genetic factors in its pharmacodynamics. However, the NAT2 gene, involved in phase II acetylation reactions, could potentially influence the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of amifampridine phosphate indirectly through its metabolizing enzymes, although this connection remains speculative and not directly studied.
