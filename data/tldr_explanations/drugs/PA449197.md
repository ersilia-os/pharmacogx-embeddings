Variants in the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1 significantly affect the metabolism of dacarbazine, a drug used for treating malignant melanoma and Hodgkin's disease, influencing its efficacy and toxicity. Genetic polymorphisms in these enzymes can lead to variations in metabolism speed, causing either increased toxicity from higher systemic drug levels or decreased efficacy due to faster than usual drug breakdown.
