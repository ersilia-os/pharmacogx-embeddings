Genetic variations in key genes such as estrogen receptors (ESR1 and ESR2) and metabolic enzymes (sulfatase - STS, and aromatase - CYP19A1) influence the effectiveness and safety of estrone sulfate therapy. Polymorphisms in these genes can modulate receptor affinity and expression, and alter the metabolic conversion rates of estrone sulfate, impacting its pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, which affects therapeutic outcomes and side effect profiles.
