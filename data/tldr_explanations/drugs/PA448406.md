Amoxicillin interacts with specific genes that affect its pharmacokinetics and the risk of adverse reactions. The transport genes SLC15A1 and SLC22A6 influence its absorption and elimination, affecting its levels and efficacy, while variations in HLA gene variants like HLA-DRB1, HLA-A, and HLA-B are crucial in predisposing individuals to hypersensitivity reactions such as skin rashes and severe allergies. Although CYP2C19's role in amoxicillin metabolism is unclear, it may have an indirect effect on the drug's deamination processes.
