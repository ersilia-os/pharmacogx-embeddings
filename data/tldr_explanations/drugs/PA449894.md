Hydralazine metabolism and clearance are greatly influenced by the N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) gene, which determines a patient's acetylator status, leading fast acetylators to process the drug quickly, reducing its efficacy, while slow acetylators may have increased drug levels and higher risk of adverse effects like drug-induced lupus. Additionally, genes such as HLA-DRB1 and MMP9 might affect immune and cardiovascular responses to the drug, though these interactions are more speculative and not directly linked to metabolism.
