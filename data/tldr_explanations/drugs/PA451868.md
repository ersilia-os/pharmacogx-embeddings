Verapamil's pharmacogenetic interactions involve its metabolism, which is predominantly managed by the liver enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, with genetic variations in these enzymes affecting the drug's metabolic rate, plasma levels, and efficacy. Additionally, its interaction with the transporter protein ABCB1 influences its bioavailability and distribution across cell membranes, while pharmacodynamic interactions with genes like ADRB1 can affect dosage requirements, particularly for cardiovascular treatments, highlighting the need for personalized medication strategies based on individual genetic profiles.
