Maralixibat inhibits SLC10A2 (IBAT) to reduce bile acid reabsorption in treating cholestatic pruritus associated with Alagille syndrome. Its metabolism and efficacy may be affected by genetic variations in CYP3A4, which can influence drug levels and response, and genetic variations in SLCO2B1 could alter its distribution, elimination, and bioavailability, leading to significant interpatient variability in treatment outcomes.
