Cobimetinib's effectiveness and safety are influenced by its interaction with various genes crucial for its metabolism and transport. Specifically, the presence of BRAF mutations (V600E or V600K) is essential for its efficacy in melanomas. Enzymes like CYP3A4 and UGT2B7, and transporters such as SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, ABCG2, and ABCB1 play vital roles in modifying the drug's plasma levels and cellular disposition, affecting both its therapeutic results and potential toxicity. Personalizing dosing based on these genetic variations can help optimize treatment outcomes and reduce adverse effects.
