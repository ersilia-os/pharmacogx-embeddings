Sulfadoxine, an antimalarial drug, interacts pharmacodynamically with human genetics primarily through considerations of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, which can increase risks of hemolysis when patients with this genetic condition are treated with sulfadoxine. Additionally, while not thoroughly documented, interactions might exist with the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, potentially affecting drug metabolization in combination therapies like Fansidar, although this is more speculative and relevant to the pyrimethamine component of the drug.
