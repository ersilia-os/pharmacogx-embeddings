Dobutamine's effectiveness and safety are influenced by its interaction with genes like ADRB1, ADRB2, ADRA1A, ADRA1B, and ADRA1D, which affect its pharmacodynamic properties, and COMT, which affects its metabolism. Variations in these genes can alter myocardial contractility, metabolic clearance, and drug response, requiring potential dose adjustments.
