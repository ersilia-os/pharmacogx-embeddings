The analgesic effects of remifentanil, an ultra-short acting opioid, are primarily mediated by the mu-type opioid receptor encoded by the OPRM1 gene; variations in this gene can alter remifentanil's efficacy and side effects, such as respiratory depression. Additionally, genes like ABCB1, COMT, KCNJ6, SLC6A4, ADRB2, SLC9A9, and TMEM8A can influence remifentanilâ€™s effects by affecting opioid signaling pathways, neurotransmitter metabolism, CNS excitability, or pain perception, though remifentanil's metabolism through nonspecific esterases rather than hepatic enzymes means these interactions might be indirect or less pronounced.
