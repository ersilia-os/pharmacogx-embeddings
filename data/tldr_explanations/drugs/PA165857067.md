Variants in the DHFR gene of malaria parasites may influence the effectiveness of chlorproguanil by potentially causing resistance, and genetic variability in human drug-metabolizing enzymes, such as CYP450 isoforms, might affect the pharmacokinetics of chlorproguanil, altering its levels, efficacy, and safety. Thus, the interactions of the drug involve both pharmacodynamic actions on DHFR in the parasite and potential pharmacokinetic processes mediated by liver enzymes in humans.
