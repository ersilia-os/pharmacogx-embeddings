Atovaquone targets the cytochrome bc1 complex and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase in Plasmodium species and humans, impacting mitochondrial functions essential for pathogen energy and pyrimidine synthesis. The drug's bioavailability and pharmacokinetics are influenced by the ABCB1 gene product, P-glycoprotein 1, which mediates its cellular efflux, and genetic variants in ABCB1 can significantly alter drug absorption and distribution, affecting therapeutic outcomes.
