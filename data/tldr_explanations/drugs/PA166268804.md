Mobocertinib's effectiveness and safety are influenced by genetic variations, particularly through the interaction with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations which enhance its pharmacodynamic efficacy in NSCLC by targeting resistant receptors. Pharmacokinetically, the drug's metabolism is primarily governed by CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7, while transporters like ABCB1 and ABCG2 impact its plasma levels and toxicity by affecting drug distribution and elimination, highlighting the importance of genetic variations in these enzymes and transporters in optimizing mobocertinibâ€™s dosage and minimizing risks.
