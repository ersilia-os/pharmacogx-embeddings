Flurbiprofen metabolism is critically influenced by genetic variations in the CYP2C9 enzyme, affecting its clearance and altering efficacy and safety by changing plasma drug levels. Additionally, gene variations in UGT enzymes (including UGT2B7, UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, UGT2B4) and transporters such as ABCC4 and SLC22A6 influence flurbiprofenâ€™s elimination and distribution, impacting therapeutic outcomes and toxicity risks, suggesting a need for personalized dosing strategies.
