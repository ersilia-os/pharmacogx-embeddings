Genetic variations in the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 influence the metabolism of upadacitinib, a JAK1 inhibitor, potentially affecting its efficacy and safety. Additionally, polymorphisms in transporters ABCB1, ABCG2, and in SLCO1B1 can affect the drug's cellular transport and availability, thereby modifying therapeutic outcomes in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.
