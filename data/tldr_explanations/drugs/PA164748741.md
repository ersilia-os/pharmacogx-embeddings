Mepivacaine acts as a local anesthetic by binding to and inhibiting sodium channels, particularly SCN10A, and its effectiveness and safety may be influenced by genetic variants in SCN10A and metabolic genes like CYB5R3 and G6PD. Variations in these genes could affect how the drug interacts with nerve impulse propagation and how cells respond to oxidative stress induced by the drug, thereby altering individual responses to the anesthetic.
