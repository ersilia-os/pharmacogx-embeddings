Thyrotropin alfa acts primarily through interaction with the TSHR gene, stimulating thyroid tissue to uptake iodine, with its effectiveness potentially influenced by genetic variations in the TSHR gene that affect receptor expression or function. There are no specific interactions with drug-metabolizing enzymes or transporters noted for thyrotropin alfa, indicating its action is primarily pharmacodynamic rather than pharmacokinetic.
