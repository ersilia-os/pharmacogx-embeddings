Variations in the CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP2B6 genes affect the metabolism of meperidine, influencing drug efficacy and side effect risks, including toxicity, due to differences in the rate at which individuals metabolize the drug. Additionally, genetic variants in the OPRM1 and OPRK1 genes, which encode for the mu and kappa opioid receptors, respectively, influence the pharmacodynamics of meperidine by altering receptor binding and response, affecting the analgesic effectiveness and risk of side effects such as opioid dependency.
