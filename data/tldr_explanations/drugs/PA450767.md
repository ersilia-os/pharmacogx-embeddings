Pamidronate inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption by targeting enzymes such as farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FDPS) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPS1) in the mevalonate pathway, disrupting lipid attachments necessary for osteoclast function and facilitating apoptosis in hematopoietic tumor cells through the activation of caspases CASP3 and CASP9. Genetic variability in FDPS, GGPS1, CASP3, and CASP9 genes can influence the drug's efficacy and apoptotic response, while variations in genes related to renal function may affect its renal elimination and overall drug levels and activity.
