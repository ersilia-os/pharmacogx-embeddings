Granisetron's pharmacogenetic interactions are primarily dictated by the metabolizing enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A1, which are crucial for its N-demethylation and aromatic ring oxidation, respectively; genetic variants in these enzymes can therefore modify the drug's metabolism, altering efficacy and side effect profile. Additionally, the HTR3A gene, which encodes the 5-HT3 receptor targeted by granisetron, also plays a significant role, as variations in this gene may impact receptor sensitivity or expression, further influencing the drug's effectiveness.
