Salvianolic acid B, used in treating cardiovascular conditions, interacts pharmacodynamically through its antioxidant effects, influencing pathways related to oxidative stress and inflammation involving genes such as NOS3 and ACE. NOS3 facilitates nitric oxide production affecting vascular tone and myocardial demand, while ACE is integral to blood pressure and vascular function regulation; polymorphisms in these genes could thus affect the drug's efficacy and safety by altering how it modulates these critical cardiovascular processes.
