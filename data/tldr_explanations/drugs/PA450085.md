Irinotecan's interactions with genes like UGT1A1, ABCC2, NR1I2, and SLCO1B1 significantly influence its pharmacokinetics and toxicity. Variations in these genes affect the metabolism, transportation, and cellular efflux of the drug and its metabolites, altering the effectiveness and adverse effects of the treatment, with the most notable being the impact of UGT1A1*28 polymorphism on the glucuronidation and toxicity profile of its active metabolite SN-38.
