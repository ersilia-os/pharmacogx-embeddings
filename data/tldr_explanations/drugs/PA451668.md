Thiotepa's pharmacogenetic interactions are significantly influenced by its metabolizing enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2B6, where genetic variants lead to different metabolic rates that affect drug efficacy and toxicity; increased activity results in faster metabolism reducing thiotepa's effectiveness, while decreased activity can cause drug accumulation and increase toxicity. Additionally, polymorphisms in GSTP1, ALDH1A1, and ALDH3A1 genes also impact thiotepa's pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, altering its detoxification process and the balance of reactive aldehyde species, which can affect tolerance and side effects.
