Lumiracoxib, a COX-2 selective NSAID, primarily interacts pharmacogenetically through the CYP2C9 enzyme, where variants like CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 result in reduced metabolic activity, thus potentially increasing the drug's plasma levels and the risk of liver toxicity. While minor metabolic pathways involving CYP2C19, CYP1A2, and UGT1A9, and potential associations with HLA variants like HLA-DQB1, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-DRB1 are noted, their impact on lumiracoxib's pharmacokinetics and safety is less significant than that of CYP2C9.
