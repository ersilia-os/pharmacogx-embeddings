Genetic variability in the UGT2B7 enzyme can significantly alter the metabolism of morphine into morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G), affecting both morphine's efficacy and side effects like hyperalgesia and allodynia. Additionally, the transporter protein ABCC3 influences the excretion and bioavailability of M3G, potentially modifying its pharmacokinetic profile.
