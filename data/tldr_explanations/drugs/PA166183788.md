Metabutethamine's interaction with the G6PD gene suggests pharmacodynamic concerns, particularly posing a risk of drug-induced hemolysis in individuals with a G6PD deficiency. This observation arises from the enzyme defect in G6PD-deficient individuals that increases vulnerability to oxidative stress leading to red blood cell breakdown.
