Phenprocoumon's effectiveness and safety are significantly influenced by genetic variations in several key genes essential to its metabolic pathways and mechanisms. The primary target gene, VKORC1, along with polymorphisms in CYP2C9 (rs1799853 and rs1057910), heavily dictates the anticoagulant activity and metabolic rate of the drug, respectively, necessitating dosage adjustments to mitigate increased bleeding risks and optimize therapeutic outcomes. Other genes like CYP4F2 and CYP2C19 also contribute to its metabolism but to a lesser extent, while STX4 and PPARA impact its pharmacodynamics indirectly.
