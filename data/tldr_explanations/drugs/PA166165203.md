Carfilzomib works by irreversibly inhibiting specific proteasome subunits (PSMB5, PSMB8, PSMB1, PSMB9, PSMB2, and PSMB10) essential for the proteolytic activities crucial in cancer cell apoptosis and cell cycle control. It is metabolized in the liver independently of the cytochrome P450 system, with the transporter gene ABCB1 playing a role in drug resistance by influencing drug efflux from cells, indicating that variations in ABCB1 could affect carfilzomib's effectiveness.
