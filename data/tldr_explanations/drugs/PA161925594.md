Tropisetron's effectiveness and side effect profile are influenced by genetic variations in HTR3A, the gene coding for its primary target, the 5HT3 receptor, which affects receptor binding or activity. Additionally, variations in the CYP2D6 gene, crucial for the drug's metabolism involving hydroxylation and conjugation, impact metabolic rates and thereby affect its plasma levels, efficacy, and toxicity.
