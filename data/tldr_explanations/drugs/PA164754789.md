The pharmacogenetics of conjugated estrogens involve metabolism by CYP3A4 and CYP1A2, where genetic variants can affect drug levels and effectiveness, and COMT, which influences metabolism through methyltransferase activity. Additionally, receptor genes ESR1 and ESR2 impact drug effectiveness due to genetic variations, and the transporter gene SLCO1B1 affects the drug's bioavailability. Other genes like ABCC1 and SULT1A1 also play roles in drug elimination and metabolism, respectively.
