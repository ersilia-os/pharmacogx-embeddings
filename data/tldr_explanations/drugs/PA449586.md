Famotidine's clearance and pharmacokinetics are significantly impacted by genetic variations in renal organic ion transporters including SLC22A6 (OAT1), SLC22A8 (OAT3), SLC22A2 (OCT2), and SLC47A1 (MATE1), which are crucial for its renal excretion. While the CYP1A2 enzyme plays a minimal role in its metabolism and is impacted by genetic differences, this is likely clinically insignificant due to the primary excretion pathway being renal rather than metabolic.
