Paroxetine metabolism is influenced by variations in several genes, including CYP2D6, which substantially affects its plasma levels and the risk of side effects, especially in individuals with polymorphisms that lead to poor metabolism. Additionally, genes like ABCB1, which affects drug efflux from the brain, and SLC6A4, which encodes the serotonin transporter targeted by paroxetine, along with serotonin receptor genes HTR1A and HTR2A, contribute to variations in drug efficacy and pharmacodynamics, potentially impacting the clinical response to treatment.
