Ziprasidone's effectiveness and safety are influenced by genetic variations in the CYP3A4 gene which affects its metabolism, and the ABCB1 gene which impacts its transport across the blood-brain barrier. Additionally, genetic differences in neurotransmitter receptor genes like HTR2A and DRD2 influence the drug's antipsychotic efficacy and its risk of causing side effects such as akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, and tardive dyskinesia.
