Ulinastatin may interact with the genes MMP9 and MMP2, which are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix proteins, potentially affecting inflammation and tissue remodeling processes that impact vascular and tissue integrity during inflammatory responses. However, the exact effects of genetic variability in MMP9 and MMP2 on the efficacy or safety of ulinastatin remain speculative, as these interactions are inferred and not well-documented or directly evidenced by research.
