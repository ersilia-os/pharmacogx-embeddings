Genetic variations in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes notably impact the metabolism of apixaban, affecting its plasma levels, efficacy, and safety through altered enzymatic activity. Additionally, genetic polymorphisms in the transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2 influence the absorption and excretion of apixaban, thus altering its bioavailability and plasma concentrations, which are crucial for its pharmacological effect and response to therapy.
