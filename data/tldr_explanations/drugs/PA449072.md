Cocaine’s effects and addiction potential are significantly influenced by genetic variations impacting its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Genes like CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 affect the metabolic rate of cocaine, while CES1 influences its hydrolysis. Additionally, transporter genes such as SLC6A3, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4, along with neurotransmitter-related genes like DRD2, OPRM1, and CNR1, alter the drug’s psychostimulatory effects and addiction risks by modifying neurotransmitter reuptake and receptor interactions.
