Variations in the genes CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and UGT2B7, which are involved in the metabolism of loxoprofen, can lead to significant differences in how individuals process the drug, affecting both its effectiveness and safety. Genetic polymorphisms in these enzymes can lead to increased drug toxicity or reduced efficacy, influenced by altered levels of hydroxylated metabolites and glucuronidation rates.
