Maprotiline metabolism is significantly influenced by the enzymes CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, where CYP1A2 is involved in its N-demethylation and CYP2D6 helps form its active metabolite, desmethylmaprotiline. Genetic variations in these enzymes can lead to altered plasma concentrations of maprotiline, affecting its efficacy and safety, with reduced CYP2D6 activity increasing drug levels and side effects, and increased activity potentially leading to ineffective drug levels.
