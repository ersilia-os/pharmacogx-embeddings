Variants in the genes CYP3A4, CYP2B6, and CYP2D6, which are involved in methadone metabolism, significantly influence its plasma levels and effect due to differences in metabolic rates. For instance, certain alleles in CYP2B6 and CYP2D6 can make individuals slower metabolizers, leading to higher plasma levels of methadone, which increases the risk of overdose and adverse effects, thereby emphasizing the importance of genotyping for personalized dosing to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize side effects in pain management and opioid dependence therapy.
