Valproic acid's pharmacogenetic interactions involve several genes like *UGT1A6* and *CYP2C9*, which influence its metabolism through glucuronidation and oxidation; *POLG* gene variants are linked to severe liver toxicity risks. Other genetic interactions include valproic acid's effects on sodium channels (*SCN1A*, *SCN2A*), GABA receptors (*GABRA1*), and its inhibition of histone deacetylases (*HDAC1*, *HDAC2*, *HDAC3*), which play roles in its therapeutic effects on seizures, mood regulation, and neuroprotection.
