Zanubrutinib's metabolism is primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with additional involvement from CYP2B6, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7, where genetic variants like CYP3A4*22 could significantly impact its pharmacokinetics by altering enzyme activity, affecting the drug’s efficacy and toxicity due to altered drug concentrations in the blood. Furthermore, the drug transporter ABCB1, influenced by genetic variations such as the C3435T polymorphism, moderates zanubrutinib’s absorption and elimination, affecting its bioavailability and distribution, while MYD88 affects pharmacodynamic responses related to mutations prevalent in certain diseases like Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia.
