Levonorgestrel's effectiveness and side effects are influenced by its interactions with genes such as CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, which govern its hepatic metabolism, and PGR and ESR1, which control the cellular response to the drug through hormone receptor sensitivity. Variations in these genes affect the drug's metabolic rate, efficacy, and the body's hormonal interactions, impacting contraceptive reliability and potential side effects.
