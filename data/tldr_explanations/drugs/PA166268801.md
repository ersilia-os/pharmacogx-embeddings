Variants in the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 genes can affect the activity of enzymes that metabolize glycerol phenylbutyrate into phenylbutyric acid (PBA) and phenylacetic acid (PAA), influencing the drug's effectiveness and safety by altering levels of PAA and the formation of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with urea cycle disorders (UCDs). These genetic differences might require pharmacokinetic adjustments to manage the drug's efficacy and avoid toxicity, while genes directly involved in the urea cycle such as CPS1, NAGS, ASS1, ASL, ARG1, and OTC, though essential for the conditions treated by the drug, do not interact with its pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic pathways.
