Stavudine, an HIV drug categorized under nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, predominantly interacts through genetic pathways that influence its cellular uptake rather than its metabolism due to minimal liver enzyme involvement. The transporter genes SLC22A6 and SLC28A1 play vital roles in its absorption and distribution, with genetic variants in these genes potentially affecting the drug's effectiveness and toxicity due to altered pharmacokinetic profiles.
