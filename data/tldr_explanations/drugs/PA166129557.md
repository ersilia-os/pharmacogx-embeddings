Lurasidone metabolism is significantly affected by variations in the CYP3A4 gene, leading to differences in its effectiveness and safety due to altered enzyme activity that impacts drug exposure. Additionally, the drug's action on 5-HT1A receptors is influenced by genetic variants in the HTR1A gene, affecting its ability to modulate serotonergic neurotransmission, which is crucial for its efficacy in treating psychiatric conditions.
