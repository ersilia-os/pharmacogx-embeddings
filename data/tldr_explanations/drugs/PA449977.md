Indinavir's pharmacokinetics are significantly influenced by genetic variations in metabolic enzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, which affect its metabolism, and consequently, its effectiveness and toxicity. Additionally, its interaction with transporters like ABCB1 and metabolic enzymes like UGT1A1 also affects its absorption, distribution, and glucuronidation, further impacting drug levels and side effects, indicating that genetic testing might be beneficial to customize indinavir therapy for individual patients.
