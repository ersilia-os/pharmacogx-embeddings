Mitomycin's pharmacogenetic interactions involve its activation by the enzyme POR, which is essential for converting the drug into its active form that can alkylate DNA, with variability in the POR gene affecting the drug's efficacy and toxicity. Additionally, the gene NQO1, which participates in the activation of quinone-containing compounds, also influences mitomycin’s activation; variants in NQO1 that reduce enzyme activity may alter the drug's therapeutic outcomes and toxicity, reflecting the significant impact of these gene variations on mitomycin’s pharmacodynamics and anti-cancer effects.
