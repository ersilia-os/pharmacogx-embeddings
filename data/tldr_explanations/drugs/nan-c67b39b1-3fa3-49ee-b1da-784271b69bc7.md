Genetic variations in the CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 enzymes significantly affect the metabolism of rifapentine, impacting drug efficacy and toxicity. Polymorphisms in CYP3A4 can alter metabolism rates, while certain alleles of CYP2C9 may decrease enzyme activity, leading to increased drug exposure and potential adverse effects.
