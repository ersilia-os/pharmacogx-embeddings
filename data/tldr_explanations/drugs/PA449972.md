Imiquimod's pharmacogenetic interactions involve its activation of TLR7, influencing cytokine production like interferon-alpha and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, with genetic variants potentially impacting its efficacy and safety. Additionally, variations in the CYP3A4 gene, responsible for the drug's hepatic metabolism, can affect imiquimod's pharmacokinetics, suggesting that differing genetic profiles can lead to variable patient responses based on both immune response and drug levels.
