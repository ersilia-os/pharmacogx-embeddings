The genes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 are involved in the metabolic transformation of aspirin into salicylic acid, with CYP2C9 polymorphisms, such as rs1799853, impacting its metabolic rate, effectiveness, and side effect profile. ITGB3 gene, through the rs5918 polymorphism, influences platelet response and the efficacy of aspirin's antiplatelet effects, while LTC4S gene variant rs730012 is associated with aspirin-induced urticaria, indicating a risk for hypersensitivity reactions.
