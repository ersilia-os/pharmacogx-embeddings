Variants in the genes CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 affect the metabolism of clarithromycin, potentially altering its efficacy and risk of toxicity, such as drug-induced hepatotoxicity or prolonged QT interval. Additionally, polymorphisms in the transporter genes SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, and ABCB1 can impact the drug's hepatic uptake, clearance, bioavailability, and efflux from cells, which influences clarithromycin's plasma concentration and exposure to target tissues, affecting therapeutic outcomes and side effects.
