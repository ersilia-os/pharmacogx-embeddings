Genetic variations in the SLC23A1 and SLC23A2 genes, which encode sodium-dependent vitamin C transporters, significantly affect the absorption and plasma levels of vitamin C, impacting its effectiveness and potential deficiency outcomes such as scurvy. Additionally, mutations in the G6PD gene influence the metabolism of vitamin C by affecting its antioxidative functions and retention in cells, contributing to increased oxidative stress levels in the body.
