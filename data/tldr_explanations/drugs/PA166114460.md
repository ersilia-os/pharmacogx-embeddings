The effectiveness of icotinib in treating non-small cell lung cancer relies significantly on interactions between its metabolic pathways, influenced by genetic polymorphisms in enzymes such as CYP3A4, and the presence of specific activating mutations in the EGFR gene, such as exon 19 deletions or the L858R mutation. These genetic factors affect the drug's plasma concentration and its therapeutic efficacy, highlighting the importance of tailored treatment based on individual genetic profiles.
