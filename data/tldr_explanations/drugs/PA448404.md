The pharmacogenetic interactions of the drug amodiaquine involve several genes, notably CYP2C8, CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and ABCB1, which affect its metabolism, transport, efficacy, and toxicity. Polymorphisms in genes like CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 impact how the drug is metabolized, while the ABCB1 gene influences its distribution in the body, affecting both its effectiveness and side effects.
