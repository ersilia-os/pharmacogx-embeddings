Desloratadine interacts with the HRH1 gene by acting as an antagonist at the Histamine H1 receptor, reducing allergic symptoms by blocking histamine action, which influences pharmacodynamics. Additionally, the drug's pharmacokinetics are affected by the P-glycoprotein transporter encoded by the ABCB1 gene, where variants within this gene can alter the transport, bioavailability, and distribution of desloratadine, potentially affecting its effectiveness and safety due to variations in absorption and clearance among different genotypes.
