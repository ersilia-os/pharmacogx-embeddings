Galantamine's effectiveness and potential for toxicity are influenced by genetic variations in the enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which affect drug metabolism, and the transporter ABCB1, which moderates drug distribution across the blood-brain barrier. Specifically, variations in CYP2D6 categorize individuals into different metabolizer types (poor, intermediate, extensive), altering galantamine's systemic concentrations and risk of adverse effects, while variability in CYP3A4 and ABCB1 also contributes to differences in drug plasma levels and efficacy.
