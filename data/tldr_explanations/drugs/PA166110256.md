Bufuralol, a beta-blocker targeting ADRB1, ADRB2, and ADRB3 receptors, is metabolized by the CYP2D6 enzyme, which exhibits genetic variability affecting drug plasma levels and therapeutic outcomes. Individuals with different CYP2D6 genetic profiles, such as poor and ultrarapid metabolizers, may experience heightened risk of adverse effects or reduced drug efficacy, respectively, necessitating personalized dosing adjustments to optimize treatment effectiveness and safety.
