Candesartan's effectiveness and pharmacokinetics are influenced by genetic variations in CYP2C8, CYP2C9, which affect the drug's biotransformation, and ABCB1, SLCO1B1, which are involved in its absorption and distribution. Additionally, genes like AGTR1 impact the drug's pharmacodynamics by affecting its ability to block angiotensin II effects, potentially altering its efficacy.
