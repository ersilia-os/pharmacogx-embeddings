Genetic variations in the cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, significantly impact the metabolism of loratadine, affecting its efficacy and safety. Those with different CYP2D6 alleles may experience a range from poor to ultrarapid metabolism, leading to variations in plasma levels which can influence the drug's side effects and necessary dosages for effective treatment.
