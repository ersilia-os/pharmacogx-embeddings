Procainamide's metabolism and effectiveness are significantly influenced by genetic variations in the CYP2D6, NAT2, and SCN5A genes. Variants in CYP2D6 and NAT2 can alter procainamide clearance rates, leading to higher plasma levels and increased toxicity risks, while genetic differences in SCN5A may affect the drug's efficacy in treating arrhythmias by altering cardiac sodium channel function.
