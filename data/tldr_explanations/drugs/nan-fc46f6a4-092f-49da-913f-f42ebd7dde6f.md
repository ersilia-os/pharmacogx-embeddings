The pharmacogenetic interactions of Pretomanid, a drug used for drug-resistant tuberculosis, involve genes like CYP3A4, which is key to its oxidative metabolism and impacted by genetic polymorphisms altering the drug's efficacy and side effects. Additionally, the bacterial enzyme Ddn is essential for activating Pretomanid under anaerobic conditions, while human transporter genes such as SLC22A8 could influence its absorption and distribution in the body.
