Genetic variations in muscarinic receptor genes such as CHRM1, CHRM2, CHRM3, CHRM4, and CHRM5 impact the function and expression of receptors, influencing the sensitivity and response to methacholine in asthma diagnosis through bronchoconstriction. Additionally, genetic variants in ADRB2, which mediates bronchodilation, may alter responses by modifying airway relaxation pathways during the methacholine challenge test, and while SLC22A5 might affect methacholine's pharmacokinetics, its influence on clinical outcomes remains unclear.
