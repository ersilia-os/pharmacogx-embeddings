Busulfan's metabolism is chiefly controlled by glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), including GSTM1, GSTA1, GSTP1, and GSTA2, which detoxify the drug by catalyzing its conjugation with glutathione, thereby impacting its toxicity and clearance based on genetic variations within these genes. The cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4 also metabolizes busulfan, though to a lesser extent, with its genetic variability affecting busulfan's plasma levels and side effects; other CYP enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 may influence metabolism, but their roles are less clearly defined.
