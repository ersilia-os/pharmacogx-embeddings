Losartan's metabolism is influenced by genetic variations in CYP2C9, leading to differences in drug levels and potential side effects, while transporter genes like ABCB1 impact its distribution and elimination. Additionally, variations in the AGTR1 receptor gene affect losartan's efficacy in reducing blood pressure, with other genes such as SLC22A12 and UGTs (UGT1A1, UGT2B7) also playing roles in its renal handling and clearance.
