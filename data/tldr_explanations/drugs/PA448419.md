Variations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) can affect the efficacy of Ampicillin by modifying drug-target interactions, impacting its pharmacodynamics. Additionally, genetic differences in transporters like SLC22A5, SLC15A1, and SLC15A2, as well as ALB, which serves as a carrier molecule, can influence the pharmacokinetics of Ampicillin by altering its absorption, distribution, and elimination, thereby changing drug exposure and response.
