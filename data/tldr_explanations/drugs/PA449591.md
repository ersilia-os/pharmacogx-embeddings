Felodipine’s metabolism is primarily influenced by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, with genetic variations in these enzymes significantly affecting its pharmacokinetic profile, plasma concentrations, and thus its effectiveness and side effect potential. Differences in metabolic activity due to these genetic variations could lead to either an overresponse or a need for higher doses in affected individuals, highlighting the importance of genetic considerations in treatment plans. The ABCG2 and CACNA1C genes also play roles in felodipine’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics respectively, but their effects are less directly established in clinical settings compared to CYP3A4 and CYP3A5.
