Variations in genes such as CYP2E1, which is crucial for dapsone's hepatic metabolism, along with other enzymes like CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, NAT2, MPO, and FMO3, affect the drug's metabolism and pharmacokinetics, potentially influencing its efficacy and toxicity. Genetic differences in the acetylation by NAT2 or metabolic oxidation by MPO and FMO3 particularly can lead to variations in dapsone's systemic exposure and pharmacological outcomes, impacting adverse effects and therapeutic effectiveness.
