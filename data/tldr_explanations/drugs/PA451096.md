Prednisolone interacts pharmacogenetically mainly through CYP3A4, which metabolizes the drug, affecting its dosage and side effects, and ABCB1, which influences its bioavailability by regulating cellular efflux. The drug’s action is further impacted by the NR3C1 gene, where genetic variations modify the sensitivity of the glucocorticoid receptor, thus affecting prednisolone’s anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive efficacy.
