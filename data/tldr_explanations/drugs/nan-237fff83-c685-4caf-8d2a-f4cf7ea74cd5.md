The pharmacokinetics of piperaquine are affected by the activity of various cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, and CYP2E1, with variations in these genes impacting the drug's metabolism and, consequently, its efficacy and safety. Genetic polymorphisms, particularly in CYP2C19, can lead to altered metabolic rates, affecting plasma levels of piperaquine and potentially leading to therapeutic failures or toxicity due to changes in drug clearance and bioavailability.
