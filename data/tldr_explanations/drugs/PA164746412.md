Tigecycline, a glycylcycline antibiotic, shows minimal pharmacogenetic interactions as it is not significantly metabolized and excreted largely unchanged, and its mechanism of action—targeting the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit—is not notably affected by human genetic variations that typically influence drug metabolism or transport. Major genes involved in drug levels and effects, such as those for cytochrome P450 enzymes or transport proteins like P-glycoprotein, do not alter tigecycline's pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties, making genetic considerations in its clinical use straightforward.
