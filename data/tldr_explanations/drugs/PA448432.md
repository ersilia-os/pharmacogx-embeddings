Anastrozole's effectiveness and side effect profile are significantly influenced by genetic variants in enzymes like CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C8, which are involved in its metabolism, and UGT enzymes such as UGT1A4, responsible for its glucuronidation. Additionally, transporter protein ABCB1 gene variations can affect the distribution and excretion of the drug, thereby impacting drug response among individuals.
