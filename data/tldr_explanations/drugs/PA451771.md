Trifluoperazine's efficacy and side effects are influenced pharmacodynamically by genetic variations in the DRD2 receptor and pharmacokinetically by variations in the CYP1A2 gene, which affect the drug's metabolism, as well as by ABCB1 gene variations, which affect the drug's distribution and excretion. This demonstrates the importance of considering individual genetic differences in managing dosing and potential side effects of the drug.
