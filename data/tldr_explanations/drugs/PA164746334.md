Cilostazol's pharmacogenetic effects are heavily influenced by its metabolism through various cytochrome P450 enzymes, notably CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, where genetic polymorphisms in these enzymes lead to variable drug levels and effects. Poor metabolization by CYP2C19 can cause higher drug concentrations, potentially increasing both cilostazol’s efficacy and the risk of side effects, while CYP3A4 plays a central role in its oxidative metabolism, affecting pharmacokinetics and thereby the drug’s overall effectiveness and safety profile.
