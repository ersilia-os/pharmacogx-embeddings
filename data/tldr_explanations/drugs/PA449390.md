Dolasetron's effectiveness and safety are influenced by its metabolism through cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, as these enzymes convert dolasetron into its active form, hydrodolasetron. Variants in these genes, especially CYP2D6, can significantly alter the levels of hydrodolasetron, affecting the drug's efficacy and raising the risk of toxicity, thus necessitating personalized dosing based on individual metabolic profiles to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize side effects.
