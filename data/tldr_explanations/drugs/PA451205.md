The pharmacogenetic profile of quinapril, an ACE inhibitor, is influenced by variants in genes such as ACE, CES1, SLC15A1, SLC15A2, and SLC22A8 which affect its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Variants in the ACE gene can alter the drug's efficacy by affecting enzyme inhibition levels and angiotensin II reduction, while CES1 variants impact the conversion of quinapril to its active form, quinaprilat; additionally, genetic differences in SLC15A1, SLC15A2, and SLC22A8 affect the drugâ€™s cellular uptake and renal excretion, impacting its overall distribution and elimination.
