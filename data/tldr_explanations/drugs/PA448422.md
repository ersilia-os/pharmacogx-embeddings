Amprenavir's efficacy and safety are greatly influenced by its metabolism and transport, governed by key genes such as CYP3A4, CYP3A5, ABCB1, ABCC1, and SLCO1B1. Variations in these genes lead to differences in the drug's metabolism rates, efflux from cells, and hepatic uptake, thus requiring dosage adjustments to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize toxicity.
