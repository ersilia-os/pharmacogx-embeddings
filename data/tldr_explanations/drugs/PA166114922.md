The pharmacogenetics of lomitapide are influenced by CYP3A4, which affects the drug's metabolism and plasma concentration, impacting its efficacy and risk of adverse effects like hepatotoxicity. Additionally, the ABCB1 gene affects lomitapide's absorption and distribution, influencing its bioavailability, while genes such as APOB, LDLR, and PCSK9 are crucial to its efficacy in lowering LDL cholesterol through pharmacodynamic processes not related to its metabolism or transport.
