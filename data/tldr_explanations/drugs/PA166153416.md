CYP2D6, a key enzyme in the cytochrome P450 family involved in metabolizing various substances, likely plays a significant role in the metabolism of coptisine, an isoquinoline alkaloid from Coptis spp. Genetic variations in CYP2D6 could affect the metabolic clearance of coptisine, thereby influencing its plasma levels, action duration, and potentially leading to differences in therapeutic efficacy and safety among individuals.
