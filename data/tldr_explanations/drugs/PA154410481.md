Prasugrel is metabolized into its active form through a series of reactions involving CES2, CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 enzymes, with CES2 initiating the conversion in the intestine and the other enzymes subsequently processing the intermediary metabolite to the active antiplatelet agent, R-138727. Polymorphisms in the genes encoding these enzymes may affect prasugrelâ€™s efficiency of metabolism, thereby influencing its effectiveness and safety, suggesting a potential benefit from genetic testing to adjust dosing and reduce adverse effects.
