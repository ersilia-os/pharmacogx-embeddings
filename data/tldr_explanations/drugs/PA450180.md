Genetic variants in CYP2C19 significantly affect the metabolism and efficacy of lansoprazole, impacting its plasma levels and leading to variability in drug response among individuals. Other genes such as ABCB1, influencing drug absorption, and CYP3A5, which contributes to lansoprazole's hepatic breakdown, also modulate its pharmacokinetics, while IL1B's role is less related to metabolism and more to gastric mucosal processes.
