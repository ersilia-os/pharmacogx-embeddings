Ceritinib interacts pharmacogenetically with CYP3A4, ABCB1, and ALK genes, impacting its metabolism, distribution, and effectiveness in NSCLC treatment. Variants in CYP3A4 affect ceritinibâ€™s metabolic clearance, while ABCB1 variants alter its absorption and distribution; mutations in ALK influence ceritinib's efficacy and resistance patterns, determining the therapeutic response in NSCLC.
