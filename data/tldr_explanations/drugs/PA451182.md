Pyrazinamide, an antitubercular drug, is metabolized in the liver by enzymes such as AOX1 and XDH, with genetic variants in XDH influencing the enzyme activity and potentially affecting the drug's pharmacokinetics and toxicity. Additionally, variations in NAT2 affect the drug's acetylation process, impacting its efficacy and side effect profile, particularly hepatotoxicity, while GSTM1 may also play a role in the drugâ€™s metabolism and disposition. Other genes like CYP2E1, CYP2C19, and TNF could be involved, but their direct impact on pyrazinamide's pharmacokinetic profile is less clearly established.
