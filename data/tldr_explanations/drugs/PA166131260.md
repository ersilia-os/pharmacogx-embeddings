The efficacy of the drug clopidogrel and its active metabolite, clopidogrel thiol metabolite H4, is significantly influenced by genetic variations in the CYP2C19 gene which encodes an enzyme vital for converting clopidogrel into its active form. Specific alleles, such as CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3, lead to reduced enzyme activity, resulting in decreased production of the active metabolite, poorer drug activation, reduced platelet aggregation inhibition, and a higher risk of thrombotic events.
