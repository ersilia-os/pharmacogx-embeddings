Faldaprevir, used in treating Chronic Hepatitis C, likely interacts with the virus's replication processes, with genetic variations in interferon lambda genes IFNL3 and IFNL4 potentially influencing treatment outcomes by affecting the host's immune response to the infection. These genes, relevant in the context of Hepatitis C treatment, may play a significant role in determining the efficacy of faldaprevir through their impact on the innate antiviral response.
