Amlodipine targets the CACNA1C gene encoding L-type calcium channels to provide vasodilation and is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes, where genetic variants can alter drug metabolism and efficacy. Additionally, variants in the ABCB1 gene affect the drug's transport, impacting its effectiveness and side effect profile, emphasizing the need for personalized dosing based on genetic makeup to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects.
