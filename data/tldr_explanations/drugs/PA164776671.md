Cinacalcet's interaction with the CASR gene influences its pharmacodynamic efficacy by affecting how the drug mimics calcium and regulates PTH secretion. In terms of pharmacokinetics, variations in the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2, which metabolize cinacalcet in the liver, can significantly alter drug levels by affecting the rate of metabolism, thus impacting the drug's effectiveness and potential for adverse effects.
