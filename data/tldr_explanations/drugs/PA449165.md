Cyclophosphamide's effectiveness and toxicity are influenced by genetic variations in enzymes like CYP2B6 and CYP3A4, which are involved in its metabolism into active metabolites, and GST genes such as GSTP1, GSTM1, GSTM3, and GSTT1, which are involved in the detoxification of its toxic byproducts like acrolein. Additionally, genes like ABCC1, ABCC2, and ABCB1, which encode ATP-binding cassette transporters, impact the drug's pharmacokinetics by affecting its efflux from cells, thereby affecting both its effectiveness and side effects.
