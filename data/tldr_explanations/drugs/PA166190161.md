Entrectinib's effectiveness in treating tumors is influenced by gene fusions or mutations in NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3, and ROS1, as it targets these genes to inhibit tumor growth and induce apoptosis. The pharmacokinetics of entrectinib involve CYP3A4, primarily responsible for its metabolism, and ABCB1, which affects the drug's distribution and excretion, with variations in these genes impacting drug concentration, efficacy, and side effects.
