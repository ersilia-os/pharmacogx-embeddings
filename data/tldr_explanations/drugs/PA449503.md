Variations in the genes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2, which govern the hepatic metabolism of estradiol, can affect its pharmacokinetics and therapy efficacy by influencing how fast the drug is metabolized. Additionally, genetic differences in transporters like ABCG2 and ABCC10, and receptor genes ESR1 and ESR2, can affect estradiolâ€™s bioavailability, distribution, and receptor binding, thereby altering therapeutic responses in conditions like menopausal symptoms or hormone-sensitive cancers.
