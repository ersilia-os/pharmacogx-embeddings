Genetic variations in the CYP2C19 enzyme significantly influence the metabolism of pantoprazole, affecting drug concentrations, efficacy, and side effect risks, with poor metabolizers experiencing increased drug exposure and ultrarapid metabolizers having reduced levels. Additionally, variants in the transporter proteins ABCB1 and ABCG2 can alter the absorption and elimination of pantoprazole, thereby impacting its plasma levels and distribution, which further affects its therapeutic outcomes and side effect profile.
