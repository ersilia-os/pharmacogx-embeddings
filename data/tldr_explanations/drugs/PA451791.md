Trimipramine's metabolism is heavily influenced by its interaction with cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, which are significant in processing the drug in the liver, affecting both its efficacy and potential side effects. Additionally, the ABCB1 transporter plays a role in the drug's distribution and elimination, further impacting its systemic exposure and therapeutic outcomes.
