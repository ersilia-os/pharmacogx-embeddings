Cortisone acetate's effectiveness and safety are influenced by the metabolism through enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, which have genetic variants that affect metabolic rates and drug concentrations in the body. Additionally, variations in the NR3C1 gene, encoding the glucocorticoid receptor, alter the drug's effectiveness by modifying receptor sensitivity or expression levels. These genetic factors are essential for personalizing treatment to optimize efficacy and minimize adverse effects.
