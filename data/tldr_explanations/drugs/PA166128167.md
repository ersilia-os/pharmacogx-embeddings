Daclatasvir is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, and genetic variations in the CYP3A4 gene can significantly influence its metabolism, affecting drug efficacy and safety. The drug's pharmacokinetics are also affected by other cytochrome P450 family enzymes (CYP3A5, CYP3A43, CYP3A7) and interactions with various drug transporters (ABCB1, SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, ABCG2), which can alter drug absorption and distribution due to genetic differences in these genes.
