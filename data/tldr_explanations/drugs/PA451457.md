Sotalol's effectiveness and safety are influenced by genetic variations in the KCNH2, ADRB1, and ADRB2 genes. Variants in KCNH2 can affect cardiac repolarization and the risk of arrhythmias, while changes in ADRB1 and ADRB2 can modify the drug's beta-blocking effects on heart rate and myocardial contractility, impacting its overall efficacy and side-effect profile.
