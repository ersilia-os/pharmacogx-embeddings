Carvedilol is metabolized mainly by CYP2D6, which turns it into active metabolites; genetic variations in CYP2D6 can significantly alter its plasma levels, impacting efficacy and potential toxicity. Other genes such as UGT1A1 and UGT2B7, which help in the glucuronidation of the drug, also affect its clearance, thus influencing both safety and effectiveness, while ADRB1 gene polymorphisms impact the drug's pharmacodynamics by modifying its binding and response in cardiovascular modulation.
