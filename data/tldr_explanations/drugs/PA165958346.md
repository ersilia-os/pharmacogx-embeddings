Vildagliptin, a drug used in managing type II diabetes, interacts with the ABCB1 gene, which impacts its pharmacokinetics by potentially altering the expression or function of P-glycoprotein, affecting the drug’s absorption and distribution. Concurrently, although vildagliptin's direct pharmacodynamics mainly involves the DPP-4 enzyme and incretin hormones, variations in the GLP1R gene, encoding the GLP-1 receptor, may also indirectly influence the drug’s efficacy and safety by affecting the physiological response to these hormones.
