Genetic variations in enzymes like CYP3A4, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, and CYP2C9 can significantly influence the metabolism of voxelotor, affecting its plasma levels, efficacy, and safety. While polymorphisms in these enzymes affect how the drug is metabolized, genetic variations in hemoglobin genes (HBB) do not impact voxelotor's mechanism, which targets and stabilizes hemoglobin to prevent sickling of red blood cells.
