Selegiline, an MAO-B inhibitor, has pharmacogenetic interactions with multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP2B6, CYP3A4, CYP2A6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6) and the transporter gene ABCB1, which affect its metabolism and pharmacokinetics. Variations in these genes can lead to differences in the metabolism, efficacy, safety, and brain availability of Selegiline, necessitating potential dose adjustments or monitoring to optimize treatment outcomes and minimize adverse effects.
