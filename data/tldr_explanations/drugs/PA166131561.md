The pharmacogenetic interactions of cotinine glucuronide are influenced by genetic variations in UGT2B10 and UGT2B17 enzymes, which catalyze its formation affecting its solubility and renal excretion. These variations can significantly alter the metabolic rate of cotinine into cotinine glucuronide, impacting its effectiveness as a biomarker for measuring nicotine exposure.
