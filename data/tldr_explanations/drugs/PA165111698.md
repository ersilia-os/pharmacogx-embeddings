Artemether is metabolized by several cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP2C9, into its active metabolite dihydroartemisinin, which is essential for its antimalarial effects. Genetic variations in these enzymes can significantly affect the metabolism of artemether, impacting its efficacy and toxicity, and suggest the importance of tailored dosing based on individual genetic backgrounds to optimize treatment outcomes.
