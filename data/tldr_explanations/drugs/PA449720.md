Gabapentin acts on the auxiliary α2δ-1 and α2δ-2 subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels (CACNA2D1, CACNA2D2) influencing neurotransmitter release, and its effectiveness and safety may be influenced by genetic variations in these channels. Additionally, the transporter LAT1 (SLC7A5), crucial for gabapentin's absorption, may also be affected by genetic variations altering its bioavailability, making pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions significant factors in the drug's effects in different patients.
