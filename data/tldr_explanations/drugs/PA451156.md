The efficacy and toxicity of Propylthiouracil (PTU) in treating hyperthyroidism are influenced by genetic variations in the thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and CYP1A1 genes. TPO gene variants can lead to differing responses to PTU, affecting the suppression of thyroid hormone synthesis, while CYP1A1 gene variants impact PTU metabolism, influencing both the drug's effectiveness and side effect profile.
