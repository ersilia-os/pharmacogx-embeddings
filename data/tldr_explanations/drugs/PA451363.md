Simvastatin pharmacogenetics involves key genes such as **CYP3A4**, **CYP3A5**, **CYP2C8**, **CYP2C9** which are essential for drug metabolism, and **SLCO1B1**, **ABCB1**, **ABCG2** that affect drug transport. Variants in these genes can influence simvastatin's levels and side effects, and can alter its efficacy due to changes in enzyme activity, drug uptake, and bioavailability. Additionally, variations in the **HMGCR** gene, the target of simvastatin, can affect the drug's ability to inhibit the enzyme and modify cholesterol reduction, while **KIF6** gene variants may impact cardiovascular benefits from high-dose simvastatin treatment.
