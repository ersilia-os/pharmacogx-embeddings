The HLA-B gene affects the immune response to phenoxymethylpenicillin (Penicillin V), particularly predisposing individuals to allergic reactions, which impacts the drug's safety and efficacy due to hypersensitivity concerns. The SLC15A1 gene influences the absorption of the drug, affecting its bioavailability and potentially altering therapeutic effectiveness and toxicity levels. These genetic interactions are crucial for determining both the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles of phenoxymethylpenicillin.
