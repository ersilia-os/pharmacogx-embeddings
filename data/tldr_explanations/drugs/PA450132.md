Itraconazole's metabolism and efficacy are influenced by genetic variations in several cytochrome P450 enzymes and transporters, particularly CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2B6, which metabolize the drug, and ABCB1, which affects its bioavailability and distribution. These genetic differences can lead to variability in drug plasma levels, impacting both the effectiveness and potential toxicity of the drug.
