Variations in the genes SLC22A1 and SLCO1A2, which code for the primary transporters of Rocuronium, can influence the drug's plasma concentration, affecting its effectiveness and the duration of muscle relaxation it provides. Additionally, mutations in receptor genes such as CHRNA2 and CHRM2, which govern its site of action, might modify Rocuronium's neuromuscular blocking effects, thereby affecting its efficacy or safety.
