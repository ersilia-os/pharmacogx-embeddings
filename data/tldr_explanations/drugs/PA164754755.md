Bepridil's metabolism is primarily influenced by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, where polymorphisms in these genes can significantly affect its metabolism rate and plasma concentrations, thereby impacting its safety and efficacy. Additionally, genetic variations in the transporter protein ABCB1 can affect bepridil's absorption and distribution, which also alters its pharmacokinetic profile.
