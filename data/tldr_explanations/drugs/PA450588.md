Naltrexone's effectiveness in treating alcohol and opioid dependence hinges on its interactions with specific opioid receptor genes, such as OPRM1, OPRK1, and OPRD1, which influence how the drug impacts mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors, and the metabolic enzyme gene UGT1A1, which affects the drug’s conversion into its active metabolite 6-beta-naltrexol. These genetic variations alter naltrexone’s pharmacodynamics and metabolism, thus affecting individual patient responses and treatment outcomes.
