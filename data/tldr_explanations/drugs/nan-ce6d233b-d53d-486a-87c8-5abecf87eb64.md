Doxycycline's effectiveness and safety may be influenced by genetic variants in MATE proteins, which affect the renal excretion of the drug, altering its blood levels and potentially its efficacy or toxicity. Despite the drug's primary elimination path being fecal, and only partial urinary excretion, these genetic factors primarily impact the pharmacokinetics of doxycycline, specifically its clearance.
