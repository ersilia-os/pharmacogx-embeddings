Genetic variations in the CYP3A4 enzyme, responsible for metabolizing pazopanib, significantly influence the drug's pharmacokinetics, impacting drug concentrations and potentially altering treatment outcomes and toxicity levels. Moreover, variations in the ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters and the UGT1A1 gene affect the distribution, elimination, and metabolism of pazopanib, respectively, contributing to differences in drug exposure and side effects such as hyperbilirubinemia. This highlights the complex interaction between genetic factors and pazopanib's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, underscoring the need for personalized dosing and management strategies in treatment with this drug.
