The metabolism of Tilidine into its active form, nortilidine, is significantly influenced by the CYP2D6 enzyme, which is responsible for the demethylation process in the liver, although direct references to this enzyme are not well-documented. Additionally, variability in the ABCB1 gene, which codes for P-glycoprotein involved in drug efflux, may impact Tilidine's distribution and effects in the body, though specific studies on this are lacking.
