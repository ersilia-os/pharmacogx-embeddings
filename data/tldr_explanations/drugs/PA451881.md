Vinorelbine's interaction with TUBB inhibits microtubule assembly crucial for cell division, thus directly impacting tumor growth. The metabolism of vinorelbine is significantly influenced by genetic variations in CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, which affect the drug's pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and efficacy, with additional potential but less defined influences from CYP3A5, ABCG2, CASP7, STMN1, and MTHFR on drug levels and cellular responses.
