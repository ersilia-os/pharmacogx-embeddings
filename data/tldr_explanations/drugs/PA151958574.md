Posaconazole's effectiveness and safety are affected by its interactions with the CYP3A4 enzyme and ABCB1 transporter through genetic variations. Variants in the *CYP3A4* gene can lead to altered enzyme activity affecting the drug's metabolism, while *ABCB1* gene variants can modify the activity of the efflux transporter, impacting posaconazole's absorption, distribution, and excretion. These gene-drug interactions are crucial for determining individual responses to the treatment, optimizing dosing, and minimizing adverse effects.
