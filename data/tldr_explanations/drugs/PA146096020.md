Nitrendipine metabolism is significantly influenced by genetic variants in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes, with variants like CYP3A5*3 leading to increased drug levels and potential side effects due to reduced enzyme activity. Additionally, variations in the ABCB1 gene affect nitrendipine's distribution and elimination by altering P-glycoprotein function, while interactions with CACNA1C affect its efficacy in modulating vascular tone and blood pressure by regulating calcium influx in vascular smooth muscle.
