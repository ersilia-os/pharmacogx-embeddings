Dimercaprol forms complexes with metals such as arsenic and lead using its sulfhydryl groups, and its efficacy is primarily linked to this binding activity rather than interactions with metabolic enzymes influenced by genetic variations. While the potential influence of genetic variations in the G6PD gene on the side effects of dimercaprol is theoretically possible because individuals with G6PD deficiency may react differently to the oxidative stress from metal toxicity and dimercaprol's chelation process, this pharmacogenetic relationship remains largely unexplored and speculative.
