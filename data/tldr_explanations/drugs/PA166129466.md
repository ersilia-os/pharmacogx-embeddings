Lonafarnib's pharmacogenetics are influenced by the metabolism via enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and several other CYP enzymes, with polymorphisms in these genes impacting its pharmacokinetics, which can affect drug levels and risk of toxicity. Additionally, variations in transport proteins like ABCB1 and SLCO1B1 affect its distribution and elimination, while its pharmacodynamics involve targeting the farnesyltransferase subunits FNTA and FNTB, and potentially affecting protein processing genes like LMNA and ZMPSTE24 in specific diseases.
