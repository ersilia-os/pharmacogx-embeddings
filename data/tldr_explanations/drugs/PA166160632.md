Nucleotide analogs like thioguanosine diphosphate (thio-GDP) may interact pharmacogenetically with genes involved in their metabolic pathways. For instance, variations in the TPMT gene, which is involved in metabolizing thiopurines, could potentially affect the activity, toxicity, or efficacy of thio-GDP, assuming it has a similar metabolism. Additionally, mutations in genes encoding enzymes like kinases or polymerases that might metabolize thio-GDP, or transporters aiding its cellular uptake or efflux, can also impact its pharmacological effects.
