Propranolol interacts with adrenergic receptors (ADRB1, ADRB2, ADRB3) to achieve its therapeutic effects on heart rate and blood pressure, with gene variations in ADRB2 possibly affecting receptor sensitivity and treatment efficacy. Its metabolism involves several cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19, with CYP2D6 genetic variations significantly impacting plasma levels and clearance rate, suggesting possible needs for dosage adjustments. Additionally, genes like ABCB1 and SLC22A2 related to drug transport could affect propranolol's distribution and excretion, influencing overall drug response.
