The pharmacokinetics of melphalan, a cancer treatment drug, can be influenced by genetic variations in solute carriers (SLC22A3, SLC7A5, SLC7A10) which are integral to its cellular uptake, and proteins (ALB and ORM1) that transport it in plasma. These genetic differences affect the drug's distribution, availability at target sites, and thus its efficacy and toxicity, highlighting the importance of considering genetic factors when administering the drug to optimize therapy and predict possible adverse effects.
