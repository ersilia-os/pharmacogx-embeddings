The pharmacogenetics of Vitamin E mainly involves the cytochrome P450 system, particularly genes like CYP4F2, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 that participate in its metabolism. CYP4F2 specifically catalyzes the omega-hydroxylation of tocopherols and tocotrienols, critical for Vitamin E catabolism, while polymorphisms in these genes can cause variations in Vitamin E metabolism, impacting its plasma levels, tissue concentrations, and overall antioxidant effectiveness.
