Variants in the CYP2D6 gene significantly influence the metabolism of perphenazine, affecting its clearance from the body and thus impacting both its effectiveness and side effect profile. Other CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 also contribute to its metabolism, which underscores the need for dose adjustments based on individual genetic differences to optimize therapeutic outcomes.
