Olmesartan, a hypertension drug, is affected by genetic variants in key genes like SLCO1B1 and ABCC2, which impact its uptake, systemic exposure, excretion, and clearance, thereby influencing its efficacy and dosing requirements. Additionally, variations in AGTR1, the drug's target, could alter its interaction with the angiotensin II receptor, affecting its therapeutic effectiveness in managing blood pressure and other cardiovascular conditions.
