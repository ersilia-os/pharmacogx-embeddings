Nevirapine's pharmacogenetic interactions are primarily influenced by genetic polymorphisms affecting its metabolism and clearance; key enzymes like CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 significantly modulate its hepatic processing. Variants in CYP2B6 can slow metabolism leading to higher drug concentrations and increased adverse effects, while genes such as HLA-DRB1 and HLA-B impact pharmacodynamics by linking to hypersensitivity reactions. These genetic variations are crucial for tailoring therapy to maximize efficacy and minimize risks in treating HIV-1 infections.
