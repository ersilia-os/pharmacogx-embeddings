Phenazopyridine functions as a local anesthetic likely by inhibiting the sodium channel subunit SCN1A, reducing pain by dampening nerve signal transmission. It poses increased risk of hemolysis in individuals with G6PD gene variants and can lead to methemoglobinemia in those with deficiencies affecting methemoglobin reductase, especially in overdose situations, highlighting its critical pharmacogenetic interactions regarding toxicity due to inherited enzymatic deficiencies.
