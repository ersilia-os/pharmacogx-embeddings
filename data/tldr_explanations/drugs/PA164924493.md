Axitinibâ€™s metabolism and transport are significantly influenced by genetic variations in enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and UGT1A1, as well as transporters like ABCB1 and SLCO1B1. These genetic factors can dramatically alter axitinib's plasma levels, effectiveness, and toxicity, thereby requiring dosage adjustments to balance therapeutic benefits against adverse effects.
