Eliglustat's pharmacokinetics are significantly influenced by the activity of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes, with CYP2D6 having a major role in determining the drug's metabolic rate and therefore its dosage requirements. Additionally, the ABCB1 transporter gene affects the drug's absorption and distribution, with genetic variability in CYP2D6 affecting individual metabolizer status (extensive, intermediate, or poor), which necessitates personalized dosage adjustments to prevent toxicity and ensure therapeutic efficacy.
