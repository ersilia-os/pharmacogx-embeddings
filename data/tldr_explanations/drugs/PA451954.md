Zidovudine's pharmacogenetic profile is mainly influenced by its metabolism through glucuronidation by enzymes like UGT2B7, where genetic variations affect drug plasma levels and toxicity, potentially influencing treatment outcomes. Additionally, interactions with transporters such as ABCB1 and ABCC4 and other genes like DDRGK1, HLA-B, and ITPA impact the drug's efficacy, distribution, and toxicity, specifically concerning adverse effects like bone marrow suppression.
