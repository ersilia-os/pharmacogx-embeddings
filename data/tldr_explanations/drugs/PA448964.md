Chlorpromazine's effectiveness and safety are influenced by genetic variations in its metabolic enzymes and receptor targets. Specifically, polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 enzyme impact drug plasma concentrations and efficacy, with additional metabolic effects from CYP1A2 and possibly CYP3A4, while genetic variants in the DRD2 receptor can modify therapeutic responses and the risk of side effects like extrapyramidal symptoms.
