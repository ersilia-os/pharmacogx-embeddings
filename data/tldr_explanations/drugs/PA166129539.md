Silibinin's pharmacogenetic interactions include its metabolism mediated by the UGT1A1 gene, which is crucial for its glucuronidation and elimination; variations in this gene can affect silibinin’s therapeutic levels and toxicity. Additionally, transporter genes such as SLC22A6, SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, and SLCO2B1, which are involved in silibinin’s hepatic uptake and systemic distribution, may impact its pharmacokinetics by altering drug absorption, distribution, and clearance, affecting drug efficacy and safety.
