The efficacy and safety of azathioprine are considerably affected by genetic variations in TPMT, NUDT15, XDH, ITPA, SLC29A1, and HLA genes. Polymorphisms in TPMT and NUDT15 genes directly impact the metabolism and toxicity of its active metabolite, 6-mercaptopurine, leading to different therapeutic outcomes and risks like myelosuppression, while genes like XDH and ITPA influence other metabolic pathways, and HLA variants are linked to hypersensitivity reactions.
