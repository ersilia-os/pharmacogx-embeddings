Verteporfin's pharmacogenetic interactions are minimal as it primarily works outside classical metabolic pathways affected by genetic variations and does not interact directly with specific genetic targets like enzymes or receptors. However, genetic variations in genes encoding plasma lipoproteins, which are responsible for verteporfin's transport, might theoretically influence the drugâ€™s distribution and efficacy, and the ARMS2 gene might indirectly affect treatment outcomes through susceptibility to age-related macular degeneration, the primary condition treated by verteporfin.
