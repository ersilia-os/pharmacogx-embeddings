Donepezil, used for dementia, is metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes, and variations in CYP2D6 can affect its plasma levels and efficacy. Additionally, genes like CHAT and CHRNA7, which are involved in acetylcholine synthesis and its receptor function, influence donepezil's pharmacodynamics by enhancing cholinergic transmission, while other genes such as PRKCE and BCHE may modify its effects through roles in neuronal signaling and cholinesterase activity, all contributing to the drug's therapeutic outcomes in dementia treatment.
