Metronidazole's pharmacokinetics are influenced by interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2A6, which are responsible for its oxidative metabolism, while UGT1A1 is involved in its glucuronidation. Additionally, genetic variations in these enzymes can alter metronidazole's metabolism speed and efficacy, and the transporter gene ABCB1 affects the drug's absorption and distribution, impacting its bioavailability and systemic circulation.
