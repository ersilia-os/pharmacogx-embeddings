The pharmacogenetics of acenocoumarol involve key genes like VKORC1, which impacts drug efficacy and bleeding risks due to variations that modify enzyme sensitivity, and CYP2C9, whose polymorphisms significantly alter the drug's metabolism, affecting plasma levels and bleeding risks, necessitating different dosing. Other genes like CYP4F2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, ABCB1, and GGCX also influence the metabolism and effect of acenocoumarol, although their roles and impacts vary, with some like ABCB1 affecting drug bioavailability and GGCX involved in processes crucial for the drugâ€™s pharmacodynamics.
