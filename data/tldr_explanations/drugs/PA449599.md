Fentanyl's interaction with genetic variants primarily impacts its metabolism and receptor binding, influencing both its effectiveness and safety profile. Variations in metabolic enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2D6 affect the rate of fentanyl metabolism, altering drug exposure and activity. Additionally, genetic differences in the transporter gene ABCB1 and the opioid receptor gene OPRM1 modify how fentanyl is distributed within the body and how it interacts with opioid receptors, respectively, consequently affecting drug efficacy and the risk of dependency or adverse effects.
