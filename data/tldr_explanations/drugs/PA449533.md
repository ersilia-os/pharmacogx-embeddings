The pharmacogenetics of ethosuximide, an anticonvulsant for absence seizures, is influenced by variability in genes CYP3A4 and CYP2E1 that encode for hepatic enzymes responsible for the drug's metabolism. Polymorphisms in these genes can lead to differing metabolic rates, affecting the drugâ€™s plasma levels, efficacy, and side-effect profiles, indicating the potential benefit of genetic testing in personalizing dosage and minimizing adverse effects.
