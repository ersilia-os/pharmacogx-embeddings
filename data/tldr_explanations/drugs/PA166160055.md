Genetic variations in genes such as CYP7A1, CYP27A1 (involved in cholic acid biosynthesis), ABCB11, SLC10A1 (critical in bile acid transport), and NR1H4, GPBAR1 (related to receptor function) significantly influence the pharmacogenetic interactions of Cholic Acid, affecting its therapeutic effectiveness and safety. Additionally, genes like HSD3B7, DHCR7, AMACR, and AKR1D1 are crucial in different stages of bile acid metabolism, further impacting Cholic Acid's pharmacodynamics and the patient's response to this treatment.
