The pharmacogenetics of carbimazole involves its conversion to the active form, methimazole, influenced by the enzyme CYP19A1, and the effectiveness of methimazole is modulated by genetic variations in thyroid peroxidase (TPO), which could affect drug efficacy and safety in treating hyperthyroidism. Variations in CYP19A1 may alter the activation rate of carbimazole, while TPO polymorphisms could impact the drug's ability to reduce thyroid hormone synthesis.
