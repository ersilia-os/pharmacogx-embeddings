Dexpramipexole primarily interacts with the DRD3 gene, which is responsible for encoding the dopamine receptor D3, affecting neurological functions that might influence the drug's efficacy and side effects in the neural system. Although the drug is also associated with effects on the QTc interval, which implies potential interactions with cardiac ion channel genes like KCNH2 or SCN5A, these interactions remain speculative as they are not explicitly confirmed in existing studies.
