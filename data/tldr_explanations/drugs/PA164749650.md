Pyridoxal phosphate's pharmacogenetic interactions predominantly relate to its role with enzymes such as AGXT2, GAD1, CBS, SHMT1, SHMT2, GOT1, GOT2, BCAT1, and BCAT2, which are crucial in amino acid and neurotransmitter metabolism. Genetic variations in these enzymes can significantly influence the metabolic effectiveness and therapeutic outcomes of pyridoxal phosphate, affecting processes like amino acid synthesis, detoxification, neuromodulation, and energy production.
