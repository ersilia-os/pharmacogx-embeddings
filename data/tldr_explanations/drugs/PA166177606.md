Variations in genes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6, which are involved in the metabolism of methadone into S-EDDP, along with UGT2B7 that affects methadone's further metabolism, play significant roles in determining the pharmacokinetics of S-EDDP. These genetic differences can lead to variations in methadone and S-EDDP levels, affecting individual drug responses and necessitating personalized dosing to manage effects and avoid adverse reactions.
