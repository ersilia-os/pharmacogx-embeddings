Lacosamide's metabolism is significantly influenced by cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, where genetic variants in these enzymes affect the drug's plasma concentration and its effectiveness in treating seizures. Additionally, the ABCC2 gene may also play a role in mediating the drug's transport mechanisms, impacting its distribution or elimination, although its specific influence on lacosamide's pharmacokinetics is less defined than that of the cytochrome P450 interactions.
