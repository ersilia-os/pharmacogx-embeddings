The pharmacokinetics of desmethylnaproxen, a metabolite of naproxen, can be affected by genetic variations in key metabolic enzymes. Specifically, the CYP2C9 gene, which metabolizes NSAIDs, and potentially the SULT1A1 gene, involved in drug sulfation, along with the less studied NPIPB8 gene, may influence the metabolism of desmethylnaproxen, thereby affecting its efficacy and safety through altered drug levels and effects.
