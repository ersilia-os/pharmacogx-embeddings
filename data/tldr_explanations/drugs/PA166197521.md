Desethyl hydroxychloroquine metabolism largely depends on the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4/5, which influence the formation and elimination of the metabolite. Additionally, genetic variants in the ABCA4 gene, affecting transporter activity, could modulate the risk of developing retinopathy by altering drug accumulation in the retina.
