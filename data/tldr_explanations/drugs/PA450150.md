Genetic polymorphisms in enzymes CYP2C9 and UGT2B7 significantly affect the metabolism of ketorolac, influencing the drug's efficacy and safety. Variants in CYP2C9 can lead to variability in plasma levels of the drug, resulting in either increased risk of adverse effects or reduced efficacy, while variations in UGT2B7 impact its conjugation and excretion.
