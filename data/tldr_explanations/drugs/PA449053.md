Clopidogrel's efficacy is significantly influenced by genetic variants in the CYP2C19 gene, which affect the enzyme's activity in metabolizing clopidogrel into its active form, impacting the antiplatelet effect and increasing cardiovascular risk. Additionally, enzymes like CES1 and genetic variations in transport proteins such as ABCB1 also modify clopidogrel's concentration and bioavailability, further influencing the drug's effectiveness in individual patients.
