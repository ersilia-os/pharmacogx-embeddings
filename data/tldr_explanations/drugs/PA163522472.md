Darunavir's pharmacogenetic interactions are influenced by genes crucial for its metabolism and transport, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, which are responsible for its oxidative biotransformation. Variants in these genes alter enzyme activity, thereby affecting darunavir's levels, efficacy, and toxicity. Additionally, transporter genes like ABCB1 and SLCO1B1 play roles in the drugâ€™s distribution and cellular uptake, impacting its plasma concentrations and effectiveness.
