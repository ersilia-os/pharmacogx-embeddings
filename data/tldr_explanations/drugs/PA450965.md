The pharmacogenetics of pimozide, an antipsychotic drug, show that variations in genes such as CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and transporter gene ABCB1 affect its metabolism and efficacy. For example, different genetic profiles in CYP2D6 can lead to altered plasma levels of pimozide, influencing its effectiveness and side effect profile, thus suggesting that genotype-specific dosing might improve therapeutic outcomes.
