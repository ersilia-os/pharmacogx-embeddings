Tamsulosin metabolism is significantly influenced by the genetic variations in CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes. Polymorphisms in CYP2D6 can lead to higher plasma concentrations of the drug, increasing risks of side effects such as hypotension and dizziness, whereas multiple gene copies can decrease drug levels, undermining its therapeutic effects. Although CYP3A4 also affects tamsulosin metabolism, its impact is generally less pronounced due to its broader substrate specificity and various genetic and environmental influences.
