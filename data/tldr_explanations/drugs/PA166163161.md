The genes CYP3A4 and SLCO1B1 play significant roles in the pharmacogenetic interactions with lovastatin and its precursor, mevinolinic acid. CYP3A4 is involved in the drug's metabolism to its active form, affecting its efficacy and safety, while SLCO1B1 impacts lovastatinâ€™s hepatic uptake and is linked to a higher risk of statin-induced myopathy due to variants like c.521T>C, which reduce its transport activity and increase systemic drug exposure.
