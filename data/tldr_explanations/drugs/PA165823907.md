Variants in the *CYP2C9* and *CYP2C19* genes significantly influence the metabolism of phenytoin and its metabolite hydroxyphenytoin; specific alleles like *CYP2C9* *2 and *3 reduce enzyme activity, leading to higher phenytoin levels and potential toxicity, while *CYP2C19* polymorphisms affect metabolic rates, which can impact drug efficacy and adverse reactions. Thus, these genetic factors are critical in determining the appropriate dosing of phenytoin to optimize treatment efficacy and minimize toxicity risks in seizure management.
