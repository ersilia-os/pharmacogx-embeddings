The pharmacogenetics of zonisamide, a sulfonamide anticonvulsant, is influenced by the CYP3A4 gene, which affects the drug’s metabolism and consequently its pharmacokinetics, impacting efficacy and toxicity. Additional genes such as CYP3A5, ABCB1, and those encoding sodium channel subunits (SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN3A, SCN4A, and SCN5A) and carbonic anhydrases (CA1, CA2) also potentially modulate its metabolic processes, transport, and pharmacodynamic properties, which can alter zonisamide’s effectiveness and susceptibility to side effects like metabolic acidosis.
