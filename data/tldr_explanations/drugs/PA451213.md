Genetic polymorphisms in metabolic enzymes, primarily CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, and transport proteins like SLC22A1 and ABCB1, significantly influence the clearance, distribution, and excretion of quinine, leading to variability in its efficacy and safety profiles. Additional variations in genes like CYP2D6 and pathological conditions like G6PD deficiency can modify quinine's pharmacokinetics and induce adverse effects like hemolytic anemia in susceptible individuals.
