Riluzole's metabolism is primarily influenced by the CYP1A2 gene, with additional involvement from CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP2E1, which affect the drug's hydroxylation and glucuronidation processes. Additionally, the ABCG2 transporter protein influences riluzole's absorption and distribution, while genes SCN5A and SLC7A11 impact its pharmacodynamics, crucial for understanding its therapeutic effects in ALS treatment.
