Rasagiline, a drug used to treat Parkinson's disease, is metabolized by the enzyme CYP1A2, and genetic variants in CYP1A2 can significantly affect the drug's plasma levels and efficacy; higher activity of this enzyme may reduce drug effectiveness, while lower activity can increase adverse effects. Additionally, other genes like COMT and DRD2 may indirectly influence rasagiline's therapeutic effects by modulating dopamine metabolism and receptor signaling, respectively, although their specific interactions need more specific investigation.
