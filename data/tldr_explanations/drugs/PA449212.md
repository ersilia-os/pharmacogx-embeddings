Daunorubicin interacts with genes such as CBR1, which converts it into its active metabolite daunorubicinol, influencing cardiotoxicity, and ABCB1, which encodes for P-glycoprotein that can pump the drug out of cells, altering effectiveness and side effect profiles. Other genes like SZRD1, MAN1B1, G6PD, SLCO1B1, UGT1A1, TPMT, SLC28A3, and SLC22A17 also contribute to its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics by affecting drug metabolism, transport, susceptibility to oxidative stress, and cellular uptake, impacting the drug's efficacy and toxicity.
