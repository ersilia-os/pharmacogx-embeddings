Acamprosate interacts with genes encoding central nervous system receptors including NMDA receptor subunits (GRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN2C, GRIN2D, GRIN3A, GRIN3B), the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (GRM5), and inhibits the Gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 1 (GABBR1), affecting both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission pathways. Additionally, the transporter gene SLC22A6, crucial for acamprosate's renal excretion, plays a significant role in its pharmacokinetics, highlighting the importance of these genetic interactions in modulating individual responses to the drug for alcohol dependence treatment.
