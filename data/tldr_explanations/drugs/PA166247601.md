The CYP3A4 gene is crucial for converting atorvastatin to its active metabolite, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin; variations in this gene can lead to differing drug levels, impacting efficacy and safety. Additionally, the SLCO1B1 gene, encoding the OATP1B1 transporter, affects hepatic uptake of statins and its polymorphisms are linked to variations in drug concentration and increased risk of statin-induced myopathy.
