Levoleucovorin, used in methotrexate treatments and with 5-fluorouracil in colorectal cancer, is metabolically activated to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which primarily involves the folate cycle where the enzyme SHMT1 plays a key role; polymorphisms in SHMT1 may affect its efficacy by altering DNA synthesis. Other genes like ABCC2 and UMPS also affect levoleucovorin's pharmacokinetics and synergistic effects with 5-fluorouracil, involving processes of drug transport and pyrimidine metabolism, respectively, thereby influencing therapeutic outcomes.
