L-Methylfolate is particularly effective in individuals with the MTHFR C677T gene variant, which reduces the enzyme conversion efficiency of folates, leading to higher homocysteine levels; this drug effectively bypasses this compromised pathway, directly serving as a cofactor for methionine synthase to lower homocysteine levels and reduce cardiovascular risks. This gene-drug interaction underscores the value of personalized medicine, allowing for tailored supplementation based on individual genetic profiles to more effectively manage conditions like depression and hyperhomocysteinemia.
