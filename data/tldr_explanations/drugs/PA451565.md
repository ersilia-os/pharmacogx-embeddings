Sulindac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is metabolized by CYP1A1 into its active form and eliminated via SLC22A6, with genetic variations in these genes affecting its bioavailability, efficacy, and risk of toxicity. Additionally, its pharmacodynamic effects are influenced by genetic differences in PTGS1 and PTGS2, which it targets to reduce inflammation, as well as by genes like PPARD, PTGDR2, AKR1B1, and AKR1B10 that modulate inflammatory and metabolic responses. These genetic interactions could guide individualized therapeutic strategies and minimize adverse effects.
