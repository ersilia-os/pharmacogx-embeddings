Variants in the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C8, and CYP2C9 significantly influence the metabolism of cerivastatin, affecting its efficacy and safety by altering metabolic rates and increasing risks of adverse effects like rhabdomyolysis. Additionally, variations in the SLCO1B1 gene, which encodes the solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1, are associated with the risk of statin-induced myopathy, highlighting the impact of genetic differences in both the transport and metabolism of cerivastatin on its adverse effect profile.
