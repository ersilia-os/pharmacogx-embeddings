Polymorphisms in the dopamine D2 receptor gene (DRD2) may affect the efficacy of bromperidol, a butyrophenone antipsychotic, by altering receptor binding, while genetic variations in the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6 can significantly influence the drug's pharmacokinetics. These genetic factors are critical in determining both the therapeutic effectiveness and the side effect profile of bromperidol, necessitating consideration for personalized treatment strategies.
