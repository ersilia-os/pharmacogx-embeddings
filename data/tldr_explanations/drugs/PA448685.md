Buprenorphine's pharmacogenetic interactions are influenced by its metabolism through enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, where genetic variations can alter drug clearance, affecting both efficacy and safety. Additionally, genetic variants in opioid receptor genes like OPRM1 and OPRK1, and the transporter gene ABCB1, affect its binding and distribution, influencing individual responses in terms of analgesic effects and addiction treatment efficacy. Other genes such as COMT and SLC6A4 also play roles in impacting pain perception and mood, respectively, further affecting treatment outcomes.
