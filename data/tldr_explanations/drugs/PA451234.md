Repaglinide's pharmacogenetic interactions are influenced by several genes that affect its metabolism and efficacy. CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 are crucial for its hepatic metabolism, impacting drug clearance and the risk of hypoglycemia, while SLCO1B1 affects its hepatic uptake, influencing plasma levels and pharmacodynamic effects. Additionally, ABCC8, which encodes an ATP-sensitive potassium channel in pancreatic Î²-cells, directly alters the drug's efficacy in insulin stimulation, highlighting the importance of genetic testing in optimizing therapy and managing patient-specific responses.
