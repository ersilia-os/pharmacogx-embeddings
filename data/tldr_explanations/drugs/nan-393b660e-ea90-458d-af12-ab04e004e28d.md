Cycloserine interacts with the human proton-coupled amino acid transporter 2 (SLC36A2) and the enzyme aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase (DDC), where variants in SLC36A2 affect the drug's absorption and pharmacokinetics, and polymorphisms in DDC can influence its side effects, particularly neurological ones, due to DDC's role in neurotransmitter synthesis. These genetic variations can lead to differences in how individuals respond to Cycloserine both in terms of efficacy and safety.
