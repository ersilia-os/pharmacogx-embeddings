Trametinib, a MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor, is more effective in cancers with certain BRAF mutations (V600E or V600K) due to its targeting of the MAPK/ERK pathway; however, its efficacy is reduced by mutations in NRAS, HRAS, or KRAS, which can activate alternate pathways and negate the effect of MEK blockade. Pharmacokinetic interactions are less prominent, involving minimal metabolism by CYP3A4 and CYP2C8, but the drug primarily undergoes deacetylation via carboxylesterases.
