The pharmacogenetic profile of metoclopramide is significantly affected by genes involved in its metabolism and transport, particularly the enzyme CYP2D6, which influences drug plasma concentration and therapeutic outcomes due to genetic polymorphisms leading to variable enzymatic activity. Additionally, CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and transporter proteins like ABCB1 also impact its metabolism and distribution, while genetic variations in dopamine D2 receptors (DRD2) can affect the drug's pharmacodynamics, altering its effectiveness and side-effect profile.
