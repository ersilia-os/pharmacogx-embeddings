Ibutilide, a drug used for treating atrial arrhythmias, interacts pharmacodynamically with genes regulating ion channels, notably CACNA1C, CACNB1, CACNA2D1 for L-type calcium channels, and KCNH2 for the hERG potassium channel, which are essential for action potential duration and cardiac repolarization. Variability in these genes, especially KCNH2, can impact the risk of drug-induced arrhythmias like torsades de pointes, crucial for understanding the drugâ€™s safety and efficacy.
