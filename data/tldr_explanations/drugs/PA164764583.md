Genetic variations in the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 significantly affect the metabolism of praziquantel in the liver, influencing its pharmacokinetics. Polymorphisms in CYP2C19, for instance, can lead to either rapid or poor metabolism of the drug, affecting plasma concentrations and consequently its efficacy and safety, which may necessitate dosage adjustments based on individual genetic profiles.
