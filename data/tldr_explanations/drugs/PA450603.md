Genetic variations in CYP3A4 significantly impact the metabolism of nefazodone, affecting drug concentrations and the risk of hepatic injury, while variations in ABCB1, which encodes P-glycoprotein, influence the drug's efflux and bioavailability. Furthermore, genetic differences in the SLC6A4 and SLC6A2 genes, which are involved in serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, respectively, are crucial in determining the antidepressant efficacy and side-effect profile of nefazodone, with additional pharmacodynamic interactions possibly affected by variations in HTR1B, which modulates serotonergic signaling.
