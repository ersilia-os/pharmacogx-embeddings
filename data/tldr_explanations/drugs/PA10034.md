Genetic variants in the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 significantly influence the metabolism of bosentan, a drug used for pulmonary arterial hypertension, affecting drug levels and risk of adverse effects. Additionally, variability in the ABCB11 gene impacts the drug's excretion and overall disposition, which further affects bosentan's pharmacokinetics.
