Variations in the CYP3A4 gene affect the metabolism of neratinib, impacting its plasma levels, efficacy, and toxicity, with changes in activity levels leading to different drug exposure and potential adverse effects like diarrhea and hepatotoxicity. Additionally, polymorphisms in the ABCB1 gene influence the distribution and excretion of neratinib, affecting therapeutic outcomes and side effects, while genes like ESR1, ESR2, PGR, and ERBB2, although not involved in its pharmacokinetics, are crucial in determining tumor response due to their role in hormone and receptor signaling pathways related to the drug's targets.
