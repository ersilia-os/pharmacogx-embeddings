The pharmacogenetics of 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide, a metabolite of cyclophosphamide, depends significantly on enzymes CYP2B6 and CYP3A4/5 for its activation, with variations in these genes affecting the drug's metabolism and thus its therapeutic efficacy and toxicity. Additionally, genetic differences in aldehyde dehydrogenase genes ALDH1A1 and ALDH3A1 influence the detoxification of its byproducts, possibly leading to increased toxicity risks such as hemorrhagic cystitis.
