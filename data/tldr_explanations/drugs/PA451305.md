Variants in the CYP3A4 gene significantly affect the metabolism of saquinavir, altering its levels, efficacy, and safety, whereas polymorphisms in CYP3A5 and the ABCB1 gene also modify saquinavir's metabolism and its bioavailability respectively. These genetic variations in metabolizing enzymes and transport proteins are crucial for determining the personalized dosing and effectiveness of the HIV treatment involving saquinavir.
