The pharmacogenetic interactions of caffeine primarily involve the CYP1A2 gene, which governs its metabolism and can greatly affect plasma concentrations and efficacy; other contributing genes include CYP1A1, CYP2A6, and NAT2. Additionally, the AHR gene affects CYP1A2 expression, while variants in the ADORA2A gene alter caffeine's effectiveness as an adenosine receptor antagonist, influencing effects such as alertness and cardiac rhythm, with genes like DRD2 and RYR1 further affecting responses through dopamine receptor activity and calcium channel regulation.
