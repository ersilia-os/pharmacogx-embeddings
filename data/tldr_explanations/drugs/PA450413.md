Methazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor used for glaucoma, interacts with enzyme isoforms CA1, CA2, CA3, CA4, and CA7, affecting aqueous humor secretion and intraocular pressure. Genetic variations in these enzymes and the SLC22A6 transporter may significantly influence the drugâ€™s efficacy and pharmacokinetics, potentially altering therapeutic outcomes and drug levels in patients due to modified enzyme activity and altered renal excretion or absorption.
