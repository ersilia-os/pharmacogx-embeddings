Ritodrine's pharmacogenetic interactions primarily involve the ADRB2 gene, which impacts its effectiveness and side effects in managing premature labor by influencing uterine muscle relaxation; variations in ADRB2 can affect drug response and adverse effects like tachycardia and pulmonary edema. Additionally, genetic differences in sulfotransferase enzymes, specifically SULT1A1 and SULT1A3, modify Ritodrine's metabolism, which can alter plasma drug levels and affect both the drug's effectiveness and the risk of toxicity.
