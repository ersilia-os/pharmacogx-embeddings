Kanamycin's pharmacogenetic interactions emphasize resistance mechanisms in bacteria, involving genes like aac, knt, and aphA1 that produce enzymes acetylation, adenylation, and phosphorylation respectively, leading to drug inactivation and bacterial resistance. Additionally, human gene MT-RNR1 might be linked to heightened ototoxic effects through mitochondrial damage in cochlear cells, a known side effect of kanamycin.
