Variations in the CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 genes significantly influence the metabolism of ketoprofen in the liver, affecting the drug's plasma levels and potentially altering risk of side effects. Additionally, genetic variants in transporters like ABCC4 and SLCO1A2, as well as in ALB, impact the renal excretion, hepatic uptake, and plasma protein binding of ketoprofen, respectively, highlighting the necessity of tailoring dosing based on individual genetic profiles to optimize efficacy and reduce adverse effects.
