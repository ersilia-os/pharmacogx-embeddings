The efficacy and safety of rosiglitazone are influenced by its metabolism through CYP2C8 enzyme variants such as CYP2C8*3, and its pharmacodynamics are affected by polymorphisms in PPARG, the drug's direct target. Other genes like SLCO1B1 and CYP3A4 also impact the drugâ€™s distribution and secondary metabolism, potentially modulating the clinical response and underscoring the importance of personalized medication based on genetic profiles.
