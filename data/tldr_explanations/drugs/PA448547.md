Variants in the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes significantly impact the metabolism of beclomethasone dipropionate into its active form, 17-BMP, thus affecting its plasma levels and potentially its efficacy and safety. Additionally, genetic variations in the NR3C1 gene influence the sensitivity of the glucocorticoid receptor, altering the drugâ€™s anti-inflammatory response, while variations in transporter genes like ABCB1 and ABCG2, and carriers such as SERPINA6, affect the distribution and elimination of the drug.
