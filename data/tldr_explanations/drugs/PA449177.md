The efficacy and toxicity of the drug cytarabine are heavily influenced by genetic variants in the DCK and CDA genes, where DCK activates cytarabine into its effective form and reduced activity variants can lower the drug's effectiveness, while CDA deactivates it and variants that decrease its function can increase toxicity from longer active drug exposure. Additionally, transport genes like SLC29A1 and ABCC10 affect cytarabineâ€™s pharmacokinetics by managing its uptake and efflux from cells, respectively, further impacting its therapeutic effectiveness and side effects.
