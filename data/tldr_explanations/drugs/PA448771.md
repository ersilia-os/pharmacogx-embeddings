Capecitabine's efficacy and safety are affected by the pharmacogenetics of specific genes involved in its metabolization and activation, such as DPYD, CES1, TYMP, and CDA. DPYD variants can reduce enzyme activity, leading to higher levels of fluorouracil and increased toxicity; CES1 and TYMP are essential in converting capecitabine into its active form, while CDA influences intermediate steps in the drug's metabolism. Recognizing genetic variations in these genes allows for personalized medicine approaches, optimizing therapy outcomes and minimizing adverse effects.
