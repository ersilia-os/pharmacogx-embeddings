Genetic variations in several key genes, including SLCO1B1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, UGT1A1, ABCB1, ABCG2, HMGCR, and KIF6, significantly affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of atorvastatin. These gene variants influence how atorvastatin is absorbed, metabolized, and eliminated from the body, as well as how effectively it targets its main enzymatic site, HMGCR, to reduce cholesterol, thereby impacting its overall efficacy and safety in treating cardiovascular conditions.
