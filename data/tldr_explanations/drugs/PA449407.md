Genetic variations in the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 influence the pharmacokinetics of doxazosin by affecting its rate of metabolism, which can impact the drug’s efficacy and safety due to either increased or decreased drug exposure. Additionally, variants in the ABCB1 gene affect doxazosin’s pharmacokinetics by altering the activity of P-glycoprotein, impacting the drug’s absorption and elimination, thereby influencing therapeutic outcomes.
