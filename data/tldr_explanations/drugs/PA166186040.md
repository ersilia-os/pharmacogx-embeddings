Tianeptine's pharmacogenetics are shaped by CYP3A4, which handles its metabolic transformation in the liver, and OPRM1, the mu-opioid receptor responsible for its antidepressant action. Variations in CYP3A4 can alter tianeptine's metabolism and its pharmacokinetic profile, affecting drug effectiveness and tolerability, whereas genetic differences in OPRM1 can impact the drug's pharmacodynamics, explaining the variations in therapeutic responses and side effects among individuals.
