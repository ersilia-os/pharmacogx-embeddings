Proguanil's effectiveness as an antimalarial drug is significantly influenced by genetic polymorphisms in the CYP2C19 enzyme, which are responsible for its conversion into the active metabolite, cycloguanil. Variants like rs4244285 and rs4986893 in CYP2C19 lead to reduced enzyme activity and hence lower levels of cycloguanil, particularly affecting populations such as Asians and Africans where these polymorphisms are common, leading to potentially reduced antimalarial protection.
