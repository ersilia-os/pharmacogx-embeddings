Genetic variations significantly influence the metabolism and efficacy of phenytoin, primarily through variations in hepatic enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 that affect drug clearance and toxicity risk. Additionally, other genes such as HLA-B, ABCB1, EPHX1, SCN1A, and SCN2A impact phenytoin's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, which include transport, metabolic activation, and neuronal excitability, ultimately influencing therapeutic outcomes and the occurrence of adverse reactions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
