Lapatinib's metabolism is predominantly handled by CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19, with genetic variations in these enzymes influencing its pharmacokinetics, which could require dose adjustments due to altered drug exposure. Moreover, variants in the HLA genes HLA-DQA1, HLA-DRB1, and HLA-DQB1 are linked to a heightened risk of lapatinib-induced hepatotoxicity, necessitating enhanced liver monitoring and potentially modified dosing to prevent severe adverse effects in susceptible individuals.
