Everolimus metabolism is significantly influenced by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, with genetic variations in these enzymes affecting the drug's plasma levels, efficacy, and potential toxicity. Additionally, the ABCB1 gene impacts its pharmacokinetics via the drug's absorption and disposition, while polymorphisms in MTOR and other growth-related genes (ERBB2, ESR2, PIK3R1, RPTOR, ESR1, FGFR4) may alter its pharmacodynamic response by modifying the mTOR signaling pathway Everolimus targets.
