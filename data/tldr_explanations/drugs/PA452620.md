The pharmacogenetic profile of tegafur is influenced by genes related to its metabolism, such as CYP2A6, which affects its conversion to the active drug 5-FU, and DPYD, where variants like rs3918290, rs55886062, and rs67376798 can cause significant toxicity by impairing 5-FU breakdown. Other genes such as FASTKD3, MTRR, EGFR, SMAD7, TYMS, and UMPS also affect tegafur's pharmacodynamics and therapeutic effectiveness, either by impacting the metabolism of pyrimidine or through pathways related to cellular growth and replication.
