Avapritinib's efficacy is significantly influenced by pharmacogenetic interactions, chiefly through mutations in the PDGFRA gene, especially the exon 18 D842V mutations, which crucially determine the likelihood of response in GIST patients. Additionally, its metabolism is primarily governed by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, where genetic variations can modulate drug plasma levels, thus impacting both its efficacy and potential toxicity.
