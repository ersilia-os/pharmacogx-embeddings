Genetic polymorphisms in NAT1, which affect the metabolic processing of mesalazine, can influence the drug’s concentration and side effects by affecting its delivery to the colonic epithelium. Additionally, variations in genes like PTGS1, PTGS2, and PPARG, which are involved in the drug’s anti-inflammatory action, and in transporter genes such as SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, and SLCO2B1, which impact the cellular uptake and removal of the drug, can also modify the efficacy and safety of mesalazine.
