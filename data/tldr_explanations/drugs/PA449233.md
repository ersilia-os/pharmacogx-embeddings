Desipramine metabolism is significantly influenced by genetic variations in the CYP2D6 enzyme, affecting drug efficacy and safety due to differences in drug plasma levels among individuals with poor or ultrarapid metabolizer statuses. Additionally, genes like CYP2C19, SLC6A2, TUBB3, BDNF, PDE11A, and MC1R may play roles in desipramine's pharmacodynamics, influencing its therapeutic outcomes and side effects through their effects on neurotransmitter systems and enzyme activities.
