Acetylcysteine, used as a mucolytic agent and an antidote for acetaminophen overdose, interacts with genes like glutathione synthetase (GSS) for detoxification and Aminoacylase-1 (ACY1) for its metabolism into cysteine. Variants in transporter genes such as SLCO1B1 and SLC22A6, as well as in the carrier protein Albumin (ALB), can alter its pharmacokinetics and affect acetylcysteine's efficacy and safety in clinical use.
