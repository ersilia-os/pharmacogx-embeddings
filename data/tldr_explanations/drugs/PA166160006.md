Lesinurad, a drug for managing gout-associated hyperuricemia, significantly interacts with genetic variations in metabolism-related genes, particularly CYP2C9. Individuals with polymorphic variants like CYP2C9 *2 and *3 alleles may experience slower metabolism, resulting in higher plasma concentrations of the drug and increasing the risk of toxicity. Thus, genetic testing for these variants is recommended to optimize dosing and minimize adverse effects.
