Alectinib's effectiveness and safety are influenced by its pharmacogenetic interactions with CYP3A4, where genetic variations affect its metabolism and plasma levels, and with ABC transporters like ABCG2 and ABCB1, which modify its absorption, distribution, and cellular efflux. These genetic interactions determine individual variabilities in therapeutic outcomes and toxicity risks, highlighting the importance of genetic testing to tailor alectinib treatment.
