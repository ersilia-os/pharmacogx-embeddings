Carbidopa inhibits DDC (dopa decarboxylase) to prevent the peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine, a crucial mechanism for treating Parkinsonâ€™s disease, while polymorphisms in DDC could hypothetically affect its efficacy. Furthermore, DBH (Dopamine beta-hydroxylase), which converts dopamine to norepinephrine, may also influence responses to carbidopa, although direct genetic associations are unspecified, highlighting potential individual variability in response due to genetic differences in enzymes linked to dopamine synthesis and metabolism.
