Aliskiren, used to manage hypertension, pharmacodynamically inhibits the function of the gene REN, affecting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that regulates blood pressure. Pharmacokinetically, aliskiren is minimally metabolized by CYP3A4 and is a substrate of the transporter protein encoded by ABCB1; variations in these genes may influence the drug's metabolism, absorption, and overall efficacy.
