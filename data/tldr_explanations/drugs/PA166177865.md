The pharmacogenetics of metoprolol, and its metabolite alpha-hydroxymetoprolol, are significantly influenced by variations in the CYP2D6 gene, which affects the enzymeâ€™s activity. These variations can lead to substantial differences in drug plasma levels and responses, where poor metabolizers may experience higher concentrations and potential toxicity, and ultra-rapid metabolizers might have lower drug concentrations and reduced effects.
