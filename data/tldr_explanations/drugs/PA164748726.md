Entacapone's interactions with genes such as COMT, CYP2D6, and UGT1A9 influence its effectiveness and tolerability in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Variations in COMT affect dopamine degradation and thus the drugâ€™s pharmacodynamic response, while polymorphisms in CYP2D6 and UGT1A9 alter its metabolism and elimination, impacting drug levels, efficacy, and potential side effects.
