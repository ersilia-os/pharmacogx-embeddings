Tepotinib, a MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in treating NSCLC, interacts primarily with the MET gene and is metabolized significantly by CYP3A4 and CYP2C8. Variants in these and other related genes, including CYP2C9 and multiple drug transport genes like ABCB1, ABCG2, and others, influence the drugâ€™s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, affecting its plasma concentrations, efficacy, and safety profiles.
