Neomycin toxicity such as ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity may be influenced by genetic factors including variations in mitochondrial genes like MT-RNR1 and MT-ND1, and genes like ALDH2. The MT-RNR1 gene interacts with aminoglycosides to impair mitochondrial protein synthesis, potentially increasing susceptibility to toxicity, while MT-ND1 and ALDH2 could influence cellular energy processes and aldehyde metabolism in renal tissues, although these interactions are speculative.
