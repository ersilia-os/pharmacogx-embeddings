Talazoparib's efficacy predominantly relies on its ability to inhibit PARP1 and PARP2, which disrupts DNA repair mechanisms, particularly in cancer cells with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations—these mutations impair the homologous recombination repair pathway, increasing vulnerability to PARP inhibition, a condition known as "synthetic lethality." Additionally, gene transporters like ABCB1 and ABCG2 affect the drug’s pharmacokinetics by altering its distribution and excretion, but talazoparib is less affected by interactions with metabolic enzymes, focusing its pharmacogenetic profile more on the dynamics of these genetic interactions.
