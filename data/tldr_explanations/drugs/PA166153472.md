Genetic variations in metabolic enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 significantly influence the pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib, impacting drug levels and thus affecting its efficacy and toxicity, as these enzymes metabolize lenvatinib into less active forms. Additionally, variations in transporter genes ABCB1 and ABCG2 affect lenvatinib's distribution and excretion, altering plasma concentrations and tissue distribution, which consequently impacts therapeutic outcomes.
