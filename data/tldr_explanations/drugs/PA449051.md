Clonidine's pharmacogenetic interactions involve its metabolism primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, affecting its plasma levels and clearance, and consequently influencing therapeutic outcomes and side effect profiles. Additionally, genetic variants in alpha-2 adrenergic receptors (ADRA2A, ADRA2B, and ADRA2C) and the G protein subunit encoding gene GNB3 impact the drug's efficacy, particularly in managing hypertension and sedation, highlighting the importance of considering these genetic factors in optimizing clonidine's usage.
