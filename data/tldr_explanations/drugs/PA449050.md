Clonazepam's metabolism is significantly influenced by genetic variants in the CYP3A4 enzyme, affecting its plasma levels and therefore its efficacy and side effect profile. Additionally, variations in the genes encoding GABA(A) receptor subunits can modify how clonazepam interacts with these receptors, thereby altering its anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effectiveness.
