Mirtazapine, a tetracyclic antidepressant, shows pharmacogenetic variability tied to its metabolism and receptor interactions, primarily influenced by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2B6, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and serotonin receptor genes (HTR2C, SLC6A4). Genetic variations in these enzymes and receptors can significantly alter mirtazapine's plasma levels and its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects, impacting both its efficacy and safety.
