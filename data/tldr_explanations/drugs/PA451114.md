Prochlorperazine's efficacy and side effect profile are influenced by polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 gene, which affects drug metabolism, leading to variations in plasma concentrations among different metabolizers. Additionally, the interaction between the DRD2 and ANKK1 genes, which are involved in dopamine signaling, affects individual responses to the drug, potentially explaining variability in pharmacodynamic responses and emphasizing the importance of considering these genetic interactions for personalized treatment strategies.
