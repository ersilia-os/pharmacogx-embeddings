The metabolism and transport of the drug dolutegravir are significantly impacted by genetic variations in genes such as UGT1A1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, ABCG2, ABCB1, SLC22A1, and NR1I2. Polymorphisms in these genes affect the drugâ€™s plasma concentration, bioavailability, and distribution, thereby influencing the efficacy and potential side effects of the treatment, which assists clinicians in customizing dosages to optimize treatment outcomes and minimize toxicity.
