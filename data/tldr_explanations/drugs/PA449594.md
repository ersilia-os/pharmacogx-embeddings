Fenofibrate's efficacy and safety are influenced by genetic variations in enzymes and transporter genes crucial for its metabolism and transport. Key enzymes such as CES1, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19, along with UGT1A9, govern its metabolic transformation and clearance, whereas transporter genes like ABCB11 and SLCO1B1 affect its hepatic uptake and biliary excretion, leading to variability in drug levels and individual patient responses.
