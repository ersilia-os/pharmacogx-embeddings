Nifedipine's metabolism and transport are significantly influenced by genetic variations in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes, which can result in variable plasma levels and influence the drug's efficacy and side effect profile. Additionally, transporter proteins such as ABCG2 and P-glycoprotein, encoded by ABCB1, affect nifedipine's absorption and efflux from cells, thereby altering its bioavailability and tissue distribution. Genetic variations in these enzymes and transporters can significantly impact the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine.
