Nitroglycerin's effectiveness and the development of tolerance are heavily influenced by the mitochondrial enzyme ALDH2, as variations in the ALDH2 gene can alter enzyme activity, impacting drug efficacy. Particularly, reduced activity of ALDH2, often seen in East Asian populations due to specific genetic variants, leads to decreased effectiveness of nitroglycerin and an increased likelihood of developing tolerance. Other genes may also play a role in nitroglycerin's response, but their influence is less clear and speculative.
