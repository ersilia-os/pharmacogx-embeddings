The pharmacogenetic profile of paclitaxel is influenced by the CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 genes, which are crucial for its hepatic metabolism; variations in these genes affect the drug's efficacy and toxicity. Additionally, genes like ABCB1, which encodes the P-glycoprotein transporter, affect paclitaxel's distribution and excretion, with polymorphisms in ABCB1 and potentially ABCC2 and SLCO1B1 altering intracellular concentrations and impacting therapeutic outcomes and side effects.
