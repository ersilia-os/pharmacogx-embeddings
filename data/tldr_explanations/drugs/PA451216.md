Variations in the CYP2C19 gene significantly affect the metabolism of rabeprazole, with poor metabolizers having increased plasma concentrations that might enhance therapeutic outcomes or elevate side effects, whereas extensive metabolizers might experience reduced efficacy due to lower drug levels. Additionally, certain variants in the IL1B gene can modify the inflammatory response in gastric cells, potentially affecting the drug's effectiveness in treating gastric conditions.
