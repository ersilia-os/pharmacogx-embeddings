Lacidipine's metabolism by CYP3A4, which exhibits genetic variability, affects its efficacy and safety by altering drug blood levels; this variability can result in either faster metabolism, potentially leading to inadequate blood pressure control, or slower metabolism, increasing the risk of side effects. Additionally, lacidipine acts on various L-type calcium channel subunits such as CACNA1C, and genetic variations in these channel genes could theoretically influence the drug's effectiveness in managing hypertension by affecting calcium flux in vascular smooth muscle.
