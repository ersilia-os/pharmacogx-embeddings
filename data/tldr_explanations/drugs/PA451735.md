Tramadol's metabolism and efficacy are significantly influenced by genetic interactions, particularly with the CYP2D6 gene which controls its conversion to the active metabolite O-desmethyltramadol. Furthermore, additional genes such as CYP3A4, OPRM1, ABCB1, and COMT also play roles in its metabolism, transport, and pharmacodynamic effects, affecting both the analgesic effectiveness and the occurrence of side effects.
