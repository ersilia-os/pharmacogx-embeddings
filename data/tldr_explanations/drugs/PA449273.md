Dextromethorphan's metabolism is primarily influenced by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6, with genetic variations in CYP2D6 leading to a spectrum of metabolic phenotypes from poor to ultra-rapid metabolism, impacting drug concentration and efficacy. Other genes like SIGMAR1 and NMDA receptor subunits may also affect drug pharmacodynamics, though their roles are less clearly defined than CYP2D6.
