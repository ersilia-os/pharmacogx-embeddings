Genetic variants in the UGT2B15 and UGT2B7 enzymes significantly impact the metabolism of oxazepam, affecting the drugâ€™s clearance and plasma levels, which can alter its efficacy and side effect profile. Additionally, allelic differences in these genes can lead to variations in glucuronidation rates, resulting in either increased or decreased drug exposure and influencing therapeutic and adverse effects.
