Genetic polymorphisms in the cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2B6, and in other enzymes and transporters such as CYP3A5, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, UGT2B7, and ABCB1 significantly influence the metabolism and disposition of efavirenz, a drug used for HIV-1 treatment. These genetic variations can affect drug levels and toxicity, underscoring the need for genotyping in patients to tailor dosing regimens and optimize therapeutic outcomes.
