Captopril's interaction with the ACE gene causes variability in its effectiveness to reduce blood pressure by influencing enzyme activity that controls angiotensin I conversion to angiotensin II. Additionally, the drug's pharmacokinetics are affected by genetic variations in ABCB1 and SLC22A6, which alter captopril's absorption, elimination, and renal excretion, consequently impacting the drug's plasma levels, efficacy, and likelihood of side effects.
