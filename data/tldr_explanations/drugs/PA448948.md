Chloroquine metabolism primarily involves CYP2C8, alongside other cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2D6, and CYP1A1, where genetic variations in these enzymes can significantly influence chloroquine's plasma levels and thus its efficacy and toxicity. Additionally, the transporter gene ABCB1 affects its distribution and excretion, while non-enzymatic factors such as G6PD deficiency impact the risk of hemolysis in treated patients, illustrating a complex interaction between genetic factors and chloroquine's pharmacological effects.
