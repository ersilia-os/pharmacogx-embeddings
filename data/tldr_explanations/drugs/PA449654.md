Flucytosine, metabolized into 5-fluorouracil mainly by gut flora, can be impacted by genetic variations in the DPYD gene, which is crucial for the catabolism of 5-fluorouracil. These variations may affect the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of 5-fluorouracil, thus influencing the safety and efficacy of flucytosine treatment.
