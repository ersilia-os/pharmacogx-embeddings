Lamivudine interacts with genes related to transport and phosphorylation; transporter genes like ABCC1-4, ABCG2, and SLC22A1-6 affect its cellular uptake and efflux, impacting drug distribution and elimination, while phosphorylation by enzymes such as deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) and UMP-CMP kinase (CMPK1) influences its activation rate. Genetic variations in these genes can lead to differences in lamivudine activation, levels, and efflux, thereby affecting the drugâ€™s efficacy and potential toxicity in treating HIV and HBV.
