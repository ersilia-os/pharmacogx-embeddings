Thio-GTP, a research tool used to study GTP-binding proteins, interacts primarily through pharmacodynamics with GTPases such as KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS. Variations in the genes encoding these GTPases could affect thio-GTP's binding efficiency and inhibitory effects, providing insights into the modulation of signaling pathways and the potential impact of genetic differences on these interactions.
