Latanoprost targets the PTGFR and its efficacy can be affected by genetic variations in this receptor, influencing receptor sensitivity or expression. Furthermore, polymorphisms in transporter genes such as SLC22A6, SLC22A8, and ABCC4, as well as the prostaglandin synthesis gene PTGS1, can alter the drug's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, impacting concentration, availability, and ultimately the clinical outcomes of latanoprost treatment.
