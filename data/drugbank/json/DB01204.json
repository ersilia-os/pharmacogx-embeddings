        "Mitoxantrone"

    "description": "An anthracenedione-derived antineoplastic agent.",
    "indication": "For the treatment of secondary (chronic) progressive, progressive relapsing, or worsening relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Mitoxantrone has been shown in vitro to inhibit B cell, T cell, and macrophage proliferation and impair antigen presentation, as well as the secretion of interferon gamma, TNFa, and IL-2.",
    "mechanism-of-action": "Mitoxantrone, a DNA-reactive agent that intercalates into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) through hydrogen bonding, causes crosslinks and strand breaks. Mitoxantrone also interferes with ribonucleic acid (RNA) and is a potent inhibitor of topoisomerase II, an enzyme responsible for uncoiling and repairing damaged DNA. It has a cytocidal effect on both proliferating and nonproliferating cultured human cells, suggesting lack of cell cycle phase specificity.",
    "absorption": "Poorly absorbed following oral administration",
    "metabolism": "Hepatic",
    "toxicity": "Severe leukopenia with infection.",
