    "description": "Primidone is an anticonvulsant used to treat essential tremor as well as grand mal, psychomotor, and focal epileptic seizures.[L11112] Primidone was developed by J Yule Bogue and H C Carrington in 1949.[A189522]\r\n\r\nPrimidone was granted FDA Approval on 8 March 1954.[L11112]",
    "indication": "Primidone is commonly indicated for the management of grand mal, psychomotor, and focal epileptic seizures.[L4645,L11112] In addition, it has also been studied and utilized as an effective management of essential tremor.[A39414,A39415,L4645]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Primidone alters sodium and calcium channel transport, reducing the frequency of nerve firing, which may be responsible for its effect on convulsions and essential tremor.[A35660] Primidone has a wide therapeutic window as doses of 50-1000mg/day were effective.[A35660] Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of status epilepticus with abrupt cessation of primidone.[L11112]",
    "mechanism-of-action": "Primidone and its metabolites, phenobarbital and phenylethylmalonamide (PEMA), are active anticonvulsants.[A35660] Primidone does not directly interact with GABA-A receptors or chloride channels but phenobarbital does.[A35660] Primidone alters transmembrane sodium and calcium channel transport, reducing the frequency of nerve firing, which may be responsible for the primidone\u2019s effect on convulsions and essential tremor.[A35660]",
    "absorption": "Oral primidone is up to 80% bioavailable with a T<sub>max</sub> if 2-4h.[A35660,A189486] A 500mg oral dose of primidone Reaches a C<sub>max</sub> of 2.7\u00b10.4\u00b5g/mL with a T<sub>max</sub> of 0.5-7h.[A189492] Data regarding the AUC of primidone is not readily available.[L11112]",
    "metabolism": "Primidone is metabolized to phenobarbitol and phenylethylmalonamide (PEMA).[A35126] This metabolism is largely mediated by CYP2C9,[A185927,A35660,A189477] CYP2C19,[A38649,A185927,A189477] and CYP2E1.[A185927,A189477]",
    "toxicity": "The oral LD<sub>50</sub> in rats is 1500mg/kg and in mice is 280mg/kg.[L11199] The intraperitoneal LD<sub>50</sub> in rats was 240mg/kg and in mice was 332mg/kg.[L11199]\r\n\r\nPatients experiencing a primidone overdose may present with CNS depression, coma, respiratory depression, suppressed reflexes, suppressed response to pain, hypotension, and decreased urine output.[A189510] Overdose should be treated with symptomatic and supportive treatment, including the removal of unabsorbed drug.[A189510]",
