    "description": "Dextromethorphan is a levorphanol derivative and codeine analog commonly used as a cough suppressant and also a drug of abuse.[A215412] Although similar in structure to other opioids, it has minimal interaction with opioid receptors.[A215412]\r\n\r\nDextromethorphan was granted FDA approval before 3 December 1957.[A215412,L14997]",
    "indication": "Dextromethorphan is indicated in combination with [brompheniramine] and [pseudoephedrine] in the treatment of coughs and upper respiratory symptoms associated with allergies or the common cold.[L14366] Dextromethorphan is also used in combination with [guaifenesin] as an over-the-counter product to relieve a cough.[L14369] Dextromethorphan in combination with [quinidine] is indicated in the treatment of pseudobulbar affect.[L14363]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Dextromethorphan is an opioid-like molecule indicated in combination with other medication in the treatment of coughs and pseudobulbar affect.[L14366,L14369,L14363] It has a moderate therapeutic window, as intoxication can occur at higher doses.[A215402] Dextromethorphan has a moderate duration of action.[L14363] Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of intoxication.[A215402]",
    "mechanism-of-action": "Dextromethorphan is an agonist of NMDA and sigma-1 receptors.[L14363] It is also an antagonist of \u03b13/\u03b24 nicotinic receptors.[A10589] However, the mechanism by which dextromethorphan's receptor agonism and antagonism translates to a clinical effect is not well understood.[A215397]",
    "absorption": "A 30mg oral dose of dextromethorphan  reaches a C<sub>max</sub> of 2.9 ng/mL, with a T<sub>max</sub> of 2.86 h, and an AUC of 17.8 ng\\*h/mL.[A34933]",
    "metabolism": "Dextromethorphan can be N-demethylated to 3-methoxymorphinan by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP2C9 or O-demethylated to dextrorphan by CYP2D6 and CYP2C9.[A415] Dextrorphan is N-demethylated by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, while 3-methoxymorphinan is O-demethylated by CYP2D6.[A415] Both are metabolized to form 3-hydroxymorphinan.[A415] Dextrorphan and 3-hydroxymorphinan are both O-glucuronidated or O-sulfated.[A415]",
    "toxicity": "A dextromethorphan overdose may present as nausea, vomiting, stupor, coma, respiratory depression, seizures, tachycardia, hyperexcitability, toxic psychosis, ataxia, nystagmus, dystonia, blurred vision, changes in muscle reflexes, and serotonin syndrome.[L14363] Overdose should be managed through symptomatic and supportive measures.[L14363]",
