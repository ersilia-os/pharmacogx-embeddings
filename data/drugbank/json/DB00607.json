    "description": "A semi-synthetic antibiotic related to penicillin, Naficillin is a narrow-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic drug. It is a beta-lactamase-resistant penicillin that is indicated for the treatment of Staphylococcal infections caused by strains that are resistant to other penicillins, except those caused by MRSA. It may be used as a first-line therapy in Methicillin-Sensitive *Staphylococcus aureus* infections [A20360].",
    "indication": "Indicated in the treatment of infections caused by penicillinase-producing staphylococci which have demonstrated susceptibility to the drug. ",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Nafcillin is a semisynthetic antibiotic substance derived from 6-amino-penicillanic acid. The drugs in this class are highly resistant to inactivation by staphylococcal penicillinase and are active against penicillinase-producing and non penicillinase-producing strains of Staphylococcus species. ",
    "mechanism-of-action": "Like other penicillins, nafcillin exerts a bactericidal action against penicillin-susceptible microorganisms during the state of active multiplication in the bacterial cell wall synthesis [FDA Label]. It inhibits the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall by forming covalent bonds with penicillin-binding proteins that play a critical role in the final transpeptidation process. Binding to penicillin-binding proteins inhibits the transpeptidase and carboxypeptidase activities conferred by these proteins and prevents the formation of the crosslinks [T28]. ",
    "absorption": "Following intravenous administration of 500mg nafcillin, the mean plasma concentration was approximately 30 \u00b5g/mL. This value was reached after 5 minutes of injection [FDA Label]. ",
    "metabolism": "Hepatic metabolism accounts for less than 30% of the biotransformation of most penicillins.",
    "toxicity": "Serious toxicity is unlikely following large doses of nafcillin. Acute ingestion of large doses of nafcillin may cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Acute oliguric renal failure and hematuria may occur following large doses. The oral LD50 in rats is >5000mg/kg and the intravenous LD50 in rats is >1000mg/kg [MSDS]. ",
