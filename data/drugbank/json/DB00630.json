    "description": "Alendronic acid is a second generation bisphosphonate that is used for the treatment of some forms of osteoperosis and Paget's disease[FDA Label][A959,A203111]. It functions by preventing resorption of bone[FDA Label][A959].",
    "indication": "Alendronic acid is indicated for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women, treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, and Paget's disease of bone[FDA Label][A959,A176750]. However, alendronic acid is not indicated for use in pediatric populations or patients with a creatinine clearance <35mL/min[FDA Label].",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Alendronic acid tablets have a very low oral bioavialability[FDA Label][A176750]. After administration it distributes into soft tissue and bone or is excreted in the urine[FDA Label]. Alendronic acid does not undergo metabolism[FDA Label].",
    "mechanism-of-action": "Alendronic acid binds to bone hydroxyapatite[FDA Label]. Bone resorption causes local acidification, releasing alendronic acid which is that taken into osteoclasts by fluid-phase endocytosis[A959]. Endocytic vesicles are acidified, releasing alendronic acid to the cytosol of osteoclasts where they induce apoptosis[A959]. Inhibition of osteoclasts results in decreased bone resorption which is shown through decreased urinary calcium, deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptidases of type I collagen[FDA Label].",
    "absorption": "Mean oral bioavailability of alendronic acid in women is 0.64% and in men is 0.59%[FDA Label][A176750]. Bioavailability of alendronic acid decreases by up to 40% if it is taken within an hour of a meal[FDA Label].",
    "metabolism": "Urinary excretion is the sole method of elimination of alendronic acid and no metabolites are detected upon urine collection[A176750].",
    "toxicity": "In clinical studies, \u22653% of patients experience abdominal pain, acid regurgitation, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, musculoskeletal pain, and nausea[FDA Label].\r\n\r\nNo information for treatment of overdose is available, however patients should be given milk or antacids to bind alendronic acid and vomiting should not be induced[FDA Label]. Patients may experience hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and upper gastrointestinal events.[FDA Label].\r\n\r\nThere are currently no studies for safety and efficacy in pregnancy, though studies in pregnant rats show fetal and maternal complications at 4 times the clinical dose and pregnant rabbits do not show complications at as high as 10 times the clincal dose[FDA Label].\r\n\r\nExcretion in breast milk, and therefore safety in lactation, is unknown[FDA Label].\r\n\r\nAlendronic acid has been studied for use in pediatric patients[FDA Label]. The oral bioavailability is similar to that in adult patients, but an increase in the portion of patients experiencing vomiting[FDA Label].\r\n\r\nThere is no significant difference in efficacy or safety of alendronic acid in geriatric populations, though there is potential for even greater sensitivity in patients at a further advanced age than those in the study[FDA Label].\r\n\r\nAlendronic acid is not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance <35mL/min, but no dosage adjustment is necessary in hepatic impairment[FDA Label].",
