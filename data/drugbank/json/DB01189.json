        "Desflurane"
    ],
    "description": "Desflurane, or I-653, a a volatile anesthetic that is more rapidly cleared and less metabolized than previous inhaled anesthetics such as [methoxyflurane], [sevoflurane], [enflurane], or [isoflurane].[A226390,A39015,A226893]. It was developed in the late 1980s out of a need for a more rapidly acting and rapidly cleared inhaled anesthetic.[A226883,A226888]\r\n\r\nDesflurane was granted FDA approval on 18 September 1992.[L30285]",
    "indication": "Desflurane is indicated for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia in adults, as well as the maintenance of anesthesia in pediatric patients.[L30285]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Desflurane is a general inhalation anesthetic.[L30285] It has a short duration of action as it is rapidly cleared.[L30285] Patients should be counselled regarding the risks of malignant hyperthermia, perioperative hyperkalemia, respiratory adverse reactions in pediatric patients, QTc prolongation, hepatobiliary disorders, pediatric neurotoxicity, and postoperative agitation in children.[L30285]",
    "mechanism-of-action": "The mechanism of inhalational anesthetics is still not fully understood.[A226490] They can block excitatory ion channels and increase the activity of inhibitory ion channels.[A226490] The most notable agonism is at the GABA<sub>A</sub> channel.[A226520] Desflurane is also an agonist of glycine receptors,[A10308] antagonist of glutamate receptors,[A10309] inducer of potassium voltage gated channels,[A10310] and inhibits both NADH-ubiquinone oxioreductase chain 1[A11113] and calcium transporting ATPases.[A4367]\r\n\r\nAn older school of thought is the unitary theory of general anesthetic action, suggesting that desflurane affects the lipid bilayer of cells.[A226490,A226510] Studies of other halogenated inhalational anesthetics have shown that the lipid bilayer spreads out more thinly as the anesthetic incorporates into the bilayer.[A226495] However, the anesthetic does not bind to lipid heads or acyl chains of hydrocarbons in the bilayer.[A226495] The effect of incorporating into the lipid bilayer is not well described.[A226495,L30285] By incorporating into the lipid bilayer, anesthetics may introduce disorder in the lipids, leading to some indirect effect on ion channels.[A226510] However, this theory remains controversial.[A226515]",
    "absorption": "Data regarding the C<sub>max</sub>, T<sub>max</sub>, and AUC of desflurane are not readily available.[L30285]",
    "metabolism": "Desflurane is minimally defluorinated by CYP2E1,[A39015] to the extent that serum fluoride levels do not increase above baseline levels.[A226390]",
    "toxicity": "Patients experiencing a desflurane overdose may experience deepening anesthesia, cardiac or respiratory depression.[L30285] In the event of an overdose, patients may require symptomatic and supportive treatment to  maintain airway, breathing, and circulation.[L30285] Discontinue desflurane.[L30285]",
