    "description": "Levodopa is a prodrug of dopamine that is administered to patients with Parkinson's due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier[Label]. Levodopa can be metabolised to dopamine on either side of the blood-brain barrier and so it is generally administered with a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor like carbidopa to prevent metabolism until after it has crossed the blood-brain barrier[Label,A177781]. Once past the blood-brain barrier, levodopa is metabolized to dopamine and supplements the low endogenous levels of dopamine to treat symptoms of Parkinson's[Label]. The first developed drug product that was approved by the FDA was a levodopa and carbidopa combined product called Sinemet that was approved on May 2, 1975[A177781,L6133].",
    "indication": "Levodopa on its own is formulated as an oral inhalation powder indicated for intermittent treatment of off episodes in Parkinson's patients who are already being treated with carbidopa and levodopa[FDA Label]. Levodopa is most commonly formulated as an oral tablet with a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor indicated for treatment of Parkinson's disease, post-encephalitic parkinsonism, and symptomatic parkinsonism following carbon monoxide intoxication or manganese intoxication[F4579].",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Levodopa is able to cross the blood-brain barrier while dopamine is not[FDA Label,F4579]. The addition of a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor prevents the conversion of levodopa to dopamine in the periphery so that more levodopa can reach the blood-brain barrier[Label,F4579]. Once past the blood-brain barrier, levodopa is converted to dopamine by aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase[Label,F4579].",
    "mechanism-of-action": "Levodopa by various routes crosses the blood brain barrier, is decarboxylated to form dopamine[Label,F4579]. This supplemental dopamine performs the role that endogenous dopamine cannot due to a decrease of natural concentrations and stimulates dopaminergic receptors[Label,F4579].",
    "absorption": "Orally inhaled levodopa reaches a peak concentration in 0.5 hours with a bioavailability than is 70% that of the immediate release levodopa tablets with a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor like carbidopa or benserazide[Label,A177781].",
    "metabolism": "Levodopa is either converted to dopamine by aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase or O-methylated to 3-O-methyldopa by catechol-O-methyltransferase[Label,A177745,A177733]. 3-O-methyldopa cannot be metabolized to dopamine[A177733]. Once levodopa is converted to dopamine, it is converted to sulfated or glucuronidated metabolites, epinephrine E, or homovanillic acid through various metabolic processes[A177745]. The primary metabolites are 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (13-47%) and homovanillic acid (23-39%)[A177733,A177805].",
    "toxicity": "There is no readily available data for the use of levodopa in pregnancy[Label]. Rabbits treated with levodopa and carbidopa produced smaller litters and their offspring developed visceral and skeletal deformities[Label]. Levodopa may lower prolactin and interfere with lactation but there is limited human data to demonstrate this effect[Label]. Levodopa is present in human breast milk and so the potential effects of nursing while taking levodopa should be considered before prescribing levodopa to nursing mothers[Label]. There is currently a lack of data on the safety and effectiveness of using levodopa in pediatric patients[Label]. Patients over 65 years of age are more likely to experience adverse effects associated with taking levodopa, however this generally is not sufficient to exclude this patient group from treatment[Label].",
