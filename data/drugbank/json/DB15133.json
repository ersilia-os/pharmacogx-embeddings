    "description": "Tepotinib is a MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor intended to treat a variety of MET-overexpressing solid tumors.[A228058] It was originally developed in partnership between EMD Serono and the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in 2009 and has since been investigated in the treatment of neuroblastoma,[A228053] gastric cancers,[A228033] non-small cell lung cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma.[A228058] MET is a desirable target in the treatment of certain solid tumors as it appears to play a critical role, both directly and indirectly, in the growth and proliferation of tumors in which it is overexpressed and/or mutated.\r\n\r\nTepotinib was first approved in Japan in March 2020 for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) with _MET_ alterations, and was subsequently granted accelerated approval by the US FDA in February 2021, under the brand name Tepmetko, for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC and _MET_ exon 14 skipping alterations.[L31443,L31473] It is the first oral MET-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor to allow for once-daily dosing,[L31473] an advantage that may aid in easing the pill burden often associated with chemotherapeutic regimens. In February 2022, tepotinib was approved for use in Europe.[L42200]",
    "indication": "Tepotinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have mesenchymal-epithelial transition (_MET_) exon 14 skipping alterations.[L31443,L45673]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Tepotinib is a highly-selective inhibitor of MET kinase activity, with an average IC<sub>50</sub> of approximately 1.7 nmol/L.[A228058] It has a moderate duration of action necessitating once-daily administration.[L31443]\r\n\r\nTepotinib has been associated with the development of interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis, which can sometimes be fatal.[L31443] Patients should be monitored closely for signs of new or worsening respiratory symptoms (e.g. dyspnea, cough), and treatment with tepotinib should be immediately withheld if ILD/pneumonitis is suspected. If no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified, therapy with tepotinib should be suspended indefinitely.[L31443]",
    "mechanism-of-action": "Mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) is a receptor tyrosine kinase found overexpressed and/or mutated in a variety of tumor types, thus making it a desirable target in their treatment. MET plays a critical role in the proliferation, survival, invasion, and mobilization of tumor cells, and aberrant MET activation is thought to contribute to the development of more aggressive cancers with poorer prognoses.[A228033] \r\n\r\nTepotinib is a kinase inhibitor directed against MET, including variants with exon 14 skipping - it inhibits MET phosphorylation and subsequent downstream signaling pathways in order to inhibit tumor cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and migration of MET-dependent tumor cells.[L31443] Tepotinib has also been observed to down-regulate the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) promoting genes (e.g. MMP7, COX-2, WNT1, MUC5B, and c-MYC) and upregulate the expression of EMT-suppressing genes (e.g. MUC5AC, MUC6, GSK3\u03b2, and E-cadherin) in c-MET-amplified gastric cancer cells,[A228033] suggesting that the tumor-suppressing activity of tepotinib is driven, at least in part, by the negative regulation of c-MET-induced EMT. It has also been shown to inhibit melatonin 1B and nischarin at clinically relevant concentrations, though the relevance of this activity in regards to tepotinib's mechanism of action is unclear.[L31443]",
    "absorption": "The absolute bioavailability of tepotinib following oral administration is approximately 72%.[L31443,A228038] At the recommended dosage of 450mg once daily, the median T<sub>max</sub> is 8 hours and the mean steady-state C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-24h</sub> were 1,291 ng/mL and 27,438 ng\u00b7h/mL, respectively.[L31443]\r\n\r\nCo-administration with a high-fat, high-calorie meal increases the AUC and C<sub>max</sub> of tepotinib by approximately 1.6-fold and 2-fold, respectively.[L31443]",
    "metabolism": "Tepotinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP2C8,[L31443] with some apparent contribution by unspecified UGT enzymes.[A228038] The metabolite M506 is the major circulating metabolite, comprising approximately 40.4% of observed drug material in plasma,[L31443] while the M668 glucuronide metabolite has been observed in plasma at much lower quantities (~4% of an orally administered dose).[A228038] A total of 10 phase I and phase II metabolites have been detected following tepotinib administration, most of which are excreted in the feces.[A228038]",
    "toxicity": "There are no data regarding overdosage of tepotinib. Symptoms of overdose are likely to be consistent with tepotinib's adverse effect profile and may therefore involve significant gastrointestinal symptoms, musculoskeletal pain, and laboratory abnormalities.[L31443] Treatment of overdose should involve symptomatic and supportive measures. In the event of overdose, dialysis is unlikely to be of benefit given the high degree of plasma protein binding exhibited by tepotinib.",
