    "description": "Terbutaline was first synthesized in 1966[A230333] and described in the literature in the late 1960s and early 1970s.[A230328] It is a selective beta-2 adrenergic agonist used as a bronchodilator in asthmatic patients.[A230333,L32093,L32098]\r\n\r\nTerbutaline was granted FDA approval on 25 March 1974.[L32088]",
    "indication": "Terbutaline is indicated for prevention and reversal of bronchospasm in patients at least 12 years old, with asthma and reversible bronchospasm associated with bronchitis and emphysema.[L32093,L32098]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Terbutaline is a beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist indicated to treat reversibly bronchospasm in asthmatic patients with bronchitis and emphysema.[L32093,L32098] It has a short duration as the inhaled form is taken up to three times daily, and the therapeutic window is wide.[L32093,L32098]",
    "mechanism-of-action": "Terbutaline is a selective beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist.[A230328] Agonism of these receptors in bronchioles activates adenylyl cyclase, increasing intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).[A230338] Increased cAMP decreases intracellular calcium, activating protein kinase A, inactivating myosin light-chain kinase, activating myosin light-chain phosphatase, and finally relaxing smooth muscle in the bronchiole.[A230338]",
    "absorption": "A 0.5 mg subcutaneous dose of terbutaline reaches a mean C<sub>max</sub> of 9.6 \u00b1 ng/mL, with a median T<sub>max</sub> of 0.5 hours, and a mean AUC of 29.4 \u00b1 14.2 h\\*ng/mL.[L32093] A 5 mg oral terbutaline tablet reaches a mean C<sub>max</sub> of 8.3 \u00b1 3.9 ng/mL with a median T<sub>max</sub> of 2 hours, and a mean AUC of 54.6 \u00b1 26.8 h\\*ng/mL.[L32098] A 5 mg oral terbutaline solution reaches a mean C<sub>max</sub> of 8.6 \u00b1 3.6 ng/mL, with a median T<sub>max</sub> of 1.5 hours, and a mean AUC of 53.1 \u00b1 23.5 h\\*ng/mL.[L32098]\r\n\r\nOral terbutaline has an oral bioavailability of 14-15%.[A229983]",
    "metabolism": "Terbutaline is sulphated or glucuronidated prior to elimination.[A229963,A229968,A229973,A230233]",
    "toxicity": "Patients experiencing an overdose may present with abdominal pain, agitation, palpitations, seizures, angina, hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, dry mouth, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, insomnia.[A230323,L32093,L32098] Discontinue treatment with terbutaline and initiate symptomatic and supportive therapy.[L32093,L32098]",
