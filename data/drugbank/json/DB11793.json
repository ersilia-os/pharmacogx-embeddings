        "Niraparib"
    ],
    "description": "Niraparib is an orally active poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. By blocking the enzymes responsible for DNA repair, niraparib induces cytotoxicity in cancer cells.[L43277] Niraparib is selective towards PARP-1 and PARP-2.[A253248] First approved by the FDA on March 27, 2017,[A253912] niraparib is used to treat epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.[L43277] Niraparib was approved by the European Commission on November 16, 2017 [L43742] and by Health Canada on June 27, 2019.[L43747]",
    "indication": "Niraparib is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced or recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.[L43277, L43742, L43747]\r\n\r\nIn Canada and the US, niraparib is also available in a combination product with [abiraterone], which is indicated with [prednisone] for the treatment of adults with deleterious or suspected deleterious BRCA-mutated (BRCAm) metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).[L46896, L47755] In Canada, this combination product is also used with [prednisolone] and is reserved for patients who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and in whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated.[L46896]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Niraparib mediated cytotoxic effects in tumour cell lines with or without deficiencies in _BRCA1/2_. Decreased tumour growth was observed in both mouse xenograft models of human cancer cell lines with deficiencies in _BRCA1/2_ and human patient-derived xenograft tumour models with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) that had either mutated or wild-type _BRCA1/2_.[L43277]\r\n\r\n_In vitro_ studies suggest that niraparib inhibits dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters, which may explain its off-target cardiovascular effects such as increased pulse rate and blood pressure.[A253248]",
    "mechanism-of-action": "Niraparib is a potent and selective inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes, PARP-1 and PARP-2.[L43742, L43747] PARPs play an important role in DNA repair. They recognize and repair cellular DNA damage, such as single-strand breaks (SSBs) and double-strand breaks (DSBs). Different DNA repair pathways exist to repair these DNA damages, including the base excision repair (BER) pathway for SSBs and BRCA-dependent homologous recombination for DSBs.[A245985] If BER is impaired, SSBs accumulate and become DSBs, forcing cells to rely on other repair pathways, mainly the homologous recombination (HR) and the nonhomologous end joining, to repair DNA damages.[A18877] However, some cells can have defective or deficient HR resulting from specific mutations in DNA repair genes, such as BRCA1 and 2.[A253248] Inhibiting PARPs in the presence of HR deficiency leads to a phenomenon called 'synthetic lethality,' whereby the PARP inhibitor impedes BER, leading to genetic instability and cell death.[A18877, A253248] \r\n\r\nSelectivity towards PARP-1 and PARP-2 is 100-fold higher than for other PARP family members.[A253248] Niraparib-induced cytotoxicity may involve inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP-DNA complexes resulting in DNA damage, apoptosis, and cell death.[L43277, L43742, L43747]",
    "absorption": "Following a single-dose administration of 300 mg niraparib, the mean (\u00b1SD) peak plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) was 804 (\u00b1403) ng/mL. The exposure (C<sub>max</sub> and AUC) of niraparib increased in a dose-proportional manner with daily doses ranging from 30 mg (0.1 times the approved recommended dose) to 400 mg (1.3 times the approved recommended dose). The accumulation ratio of niraparib exposure following 21 days of repeated daily doses was approximately 2-fold for doses ranging from 30 to 400 mg. The Tmax is about three hours.[L43277]\r\n\r\nThe absolute bioavailability of niraparib is approximately 73%. Food does not appear to affect drug exposure.[L43277]",
    "metabolism": "Niraparib is primarily metabolized by carboxylesterases (CEs) to form M1, which is a major inactive metabolite. The M1 metabolite can subsequently undergo glucuronidation mediated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) to form the M10 metabolite.[L43277] In a mass balance study, M1 and M10 were the major circulating metabolites.[L43742] The M1 metabolite can also undergo methylation, monooxygenation, and hydrogenation to form other minor metabolites.[A253937]",
    "toxicity": "There is limited information available regarding the acute toxicity profile and overdosage of niraparib.",
