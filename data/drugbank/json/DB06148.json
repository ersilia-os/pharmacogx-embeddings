    "description": "A tetracyclic compound with antidepressant effects. Mianserin was previously available internationally, however in most markets it has been phased out in favour of [mirtazapine].",
    "indication": "For the treatment of depression.",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Mianserin is a tetracyclic antidepressant that has antihistaminic and hypnosedative, but almost no anticholinergic, effect. It is a weak inhibitor of norepinephrine reuptake and strongly stimulates the release of norepinephrine. Interactions with serotonin receptors in the central nervous system have also been found. Its effect is usually noticeable after one to three weeks. Mianserin may cause drowsiness and hematological problems.",
    "mechanism-of-action": "Mianserin's mechanism of therapeutic action is not well understood, although it apparently blocks alpha-adrenergic, histamine H1, and some types of serotonin receptors.",
    "absorption": "Absorbed following oral administration.",
    "metabolism": "Hepatic.",
    "toxicity": "Oral rat LD<sub>50</sub>: 780mg/kg",
