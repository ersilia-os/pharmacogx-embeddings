    "description": "Fenofibrate is a fibric acid derivative like [clofibrate] and [gemfibrozil].[A185954] Fenofibrate is used to treat primary hypercholesterolemia, mixed dyslipidemia, severe hypertriglyceridemia.[L8588,L8591]\r\n\r\nFenofibrate was granted FDA approval on 31 December 1993.[L8585]",
    "indication": "Fenofibrate is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce elevated LDL-C, Total-C, Triglycerides, and Apo B, and to increase HDL-C adults with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia.[L8588,L8591] Fenofibrate is also indicated to treat adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia.[L8588,L8591]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Fenofibrate is a fibrate that activates peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPAR\u03b1) to alter lipid metabolism and treat primary hypercholesterolemia, mixed dyslipidemia, and severe hypertriglyceridemia.[A186002,L8588,L8591] Fenofibrate requires once daily dosing and has a half life of 19-27 hours so its duration of action is long.[A36366,L8588,L8591] Fenofibrate capsules are given at a dose of 50-150mg daily so the therapeutic index is wide.[L8591] Patients should be counselled about the risk of rhabdomyolysis, myopathy, and cholelithiasis when taking fibrates.[L8588,L8591]",
    "mechanism-of-action": "Fenofibrate activates peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPAR\u03b1), increasing lipolysis, activating lipoprotein lipase, and reducing apoprotein C-III.[A186002,L8588,L8591] PPAR\u03b1 is a nuclear receptor and its activation alters lipid, glucose, and amino acid homeostasis.[A186002] Activation of PPAR\u03b1 activates transcription of gene transcription and translation that generates peroxisomes filled with hydrogen peroxide, reactive oxygen species, and hydroxyl radicals that also participate in lipolysis.[A186005] This mechanism of increased lipid metabolism is also associated with increased oxidative stress on the liver.[A186005] In rare cases this stress can lead to cirrhosis and chronic active hepatitis.[A186002,L8588,L8591]",
    "absorption": "A single 300mg oral dose of fenofibrate reaches a C<sub>max</sub> of 6-9.5mg/L with a T<sub>max</sub> of 4-6h in healthy, fasting volunteers.[A185954]",
    "metabolism": "Fenofibrate is completely hydrolyzed by liver carboxylesterase 1 to fenofibric acid.[A185972,L8588,L8591] Fenofibric acid is either glucuronidated or has its carbonyl group reduced to a benzhydrol that is then glucuronidated.[L8588,L8591] Glucuronidation of fenofibrate metabolites is mediated by UGT1A9.[A17495] Reduction of the carbonyl group is primarily mediated by CBR1 and minorly by AKR1C1, AKR1C2, AKR1C3, and AKR1B1.[A185984]",
    "toxicity": "The oral LD<sub>50</sub> in rats is >2g/kg and in mice is 1600mg/kg.[L8651] The oral TDLO in rats is 9mg/kg.[L8651]\r\n\r\nTreat patients with supportive care including monitoring of vital signs and observing clinical status.[L8588,L8591] Recent overdose may be treated with inducing vomiting or gastric lavage.[L8588,L8591] Due to fenofibrate's extensive protein binding, hemodialysis is not expected to be useful.[A185936,L8588,L8591]",
