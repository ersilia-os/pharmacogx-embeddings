    "description": "Fesoterodine is an antimuscarinic prodrug for the treatment of overactive bladder syndrome.",
    "indication": "Fesoterodine is indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency.[L37624] It is also indicated in the treatment of neurogenic detrusor overactivity in pediatric patients \u22656 years old weighing >25 kg.[L37624]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "In-vivo the fesoteridine prodrug is broken down into its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), by plasma esterases. The 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. Therefore, acting as a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist, fesoterodine ultimately acts to decrease the detrusor pressure by its muscarinic antagonism, thereby decreasing bladder contraction and consequently, the urge to urinate.",
    "mechanism-of-action": "Fesoterodine, once converted to its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyltolterodine, acts as a competitive antagonists at muscarinic receptors. This results in the inhibition of bladder contraction, decrease in detrusor pressure, and an incomplete emptying of the bladder.",
    "absorption": "Tmax (5-HMT): 5 hours post-adminitration of fesoterodine. \r\nAUC (0,\u221e)= 49.5 ng\u00b7h/ ml  \r\nBioavailability, 5-HMT = 52% ",
    "metabolism": "Metabolized by ubiquitous, nonspecific esterases to transform fesoterodine into 5-HMT\r\nExtensive metabolism via CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 into inactive metabolites ",
    "toxicity": "Rat, Oral, LD50: ~ 681 mg/kg\r\nMouse, Oral, LD50: ~ 316 mg/kg \r\nRat, Intravenous, NOAEL: 10 mg/kg\r\nMouse, Intravenous, NOAEL: 10 mg/kg",
