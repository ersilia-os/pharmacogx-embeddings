    "description": "Phenylephrine is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist used to treat hypotension,[L9416,L9410] dilate the pupil,[L9413] and induce local vasoconstriction.[A187370] The action of phenylephrine, or neo-synephrine, was first described in literature in the 1930s.[A187376]\r\n\r\nPhenylephrine was granted FDA approval in 1939.[L9413]",
    "indication": "Phenylephrine is available in various drug formulations, which have different indications. Phenylephrine injections are indicated to treat hypotension caused by shock or anesthesia.[L9416, L9410] The ophthalmic formulation is indicated to induce mydriasis [L9413, L46332] and conjunctival vasoconstriction.[A187370] The intranasal formulation is used to treat congestion, and a topical formulation is used to treat hemorrhoids.[A187370] Off-label uses include priapism and induction of local vasoconstriction.[A187370]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Phenylephrine is an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist that raises blood pressure,[L9416,L9410] dilates the pupils,[L9413] and causes local vasoconstriction.[A187370] Ophthalmic formulations of phenylephrine act for 3-8 hours[L9413] while intravenous solutions have an effective half life of 5 minutes and an elimination half life of 2.5 hours.[A187379,L9416] Patients taking ophthalmic formulations of phenylephrine should be counselled about the risk of arrhythmia, hypertension, and rebound miosis.[L9413] Patients taking an intravenous formulation should be counselled regarding the risk of bradycardia, allergic reactions, extravasation causing necrosis or tissue sloughing, and the concomitant use of oxytocic drugs.[L9416,L9410]",
    "mechanism-of-action": "Phenylephrine is an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist that mediates vasoconstriction[A187370] and mydriasis[L9413] depending on the route and location of administration. Systemic exposure to phenylephrine also leads to agonism of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, raising systolic and diastolic pressure as well as peripheral vascular resistance.[L9416,L9410] Increased blood pressure stimulates the vagus nerve, causing reflex bradycardia.[L9416,L9410]",
    "absorption": "Phenylephrine is 38% orally bioavailable.[A187379] Clinically significant systemic absorption of ophthalmic formulations is possible, especially at higher strengths and when the cornea is damaged.[L9416]",
    "metabolism": "Phenylephrine is mainly metabolized by monoamine oxidase A, monoamine oxidase B, and SULT1A3.[A187382,A187385,L9416,L9410] The major metabolite is the inactive meta-hydroxymandelic acid, followed by sulfate conjugates.[A187385,L9416,L9410] Phenylephrine can also be metabolized to phenylephrine glucuronide.[A187385]",
    "toxicity": "Patients experiencing and overdose may present with headache, hypertension, reflex bradycardia, tingling limbs, cardiac arrhythmias, and a feeling of fullness in the head.[L9416,L9413,L9410] Overdose may be treated by supportive care and discontinuing phenylephrine, chronotropic medications, and vasodilators.[A187370] Subcutaneous phentolamine may be used to treat tissue extravasation.[A187370,L9413]",
