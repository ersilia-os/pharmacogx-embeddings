    "description": "Nitrofurantoin is a nitrofuran antibiotic used to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infections.[L6856,L6859,L6862] Nitrofurantoin is converted by bacterial nitroreductases to electrophilic intermediates which inhibit the citric acid cycle as well as synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein.[A179824] This drug is more resistant to the development of bacterial resistance because it acts on many targets at once.[A179824] Nitrofurantoin is a second line treatment to [trimethoprim]/[sulfamethoxazole].[A179830]\r\n\r\nNitrofurantoin was granted FDA approval on 6 February 1953.[L6895]",
    "indication": "Nitrofurantoin is indicated to treat acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections.[L6856,L6859,L6862]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Nitrofurantoin interferes with vital processes in bacteria, which leads to their death.[A179824] Nitrofurantoin rapidly reaches therapeutic concentrations in the urine and is also cleared rapidly.[A179830]",
    "mechanism-of-action": "Nitrofurantoin is converted by bacterial nitroreductases to electrophilic intermediates which inhibit the citric acid cycle as well as synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein.[A179824]",
    "absorption": "Nitrofurantoin reaches a C<sub>max</sub> of 0.875-0.963mg/L with an AUC of 2.21-2.42mg\\*h/L.[A179830] It is 38.8-44.3% bioavailable.[A179830] Taking nitrofurantoin with food increases the absorption and duration of therapeutic concentrations in the urine.[A179854]",
    "metabolism": "0.8-1.8% of a dose is metabolized to aminofurantoin, and \u22640.9% of a dose is metabolized to other metabolites.[A179860]",
    "toxicity": "Symptoms of overdose include vomiting.[L6856,L6859,L6862] In case of overdose, induce vomiting if it has not already occurred and increase fluid intake to promote urination.[L6856,L6859,L6862] In extreme cases, nitrofurantoin can be removed from circulation by dialysis.[L6856,L6859,L6862]",
