    "description": "Imipramine, the prototypical tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), is a dibenzazepine-derivative TCA. TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, imipramine does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, imipramine exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Tertiary amine TCAs, such as imipramine and amitriptyline, are more potent inhibitors of serotonin reuptake than secondary amine TCAs, such as nortriptyline and desipramine. TCAs also block histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively [A6584]. Imipramine has less sedative and anticholinergic effects than the tertiary amine TCAs, amitriptyline and clomipramine. Imipramine may be used to treat depression and nocturnal enuresis in children [FDA Label]. Unlabeled indications include chronic and neuropathic pain (including diabetic neuropathy), panic disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [L1349,L1348,A31900,L1351,L1352,L1353,A31904].",
    "indication": "For the relief of symptoms of depression and as temporary adjunctive therapy in reducing enuresis in children aged 6 years and older [FDA Label]. \r\n\r\nMay also be used off-label to manage panic disorders with or without agoraphobia, as a second line agent for ADHD in children and adolescents, to manage bulimia nervosa, for short-term management of acute depressive episodes in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, for the treatment of acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder, and for symptomatic treatment of postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy [L1349,L1348,A31900,L1351,L1352,L1353,A31904]. ",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant with general pharmacological properties similar to those of structurally related tricyclic antidepressant drugs such as amitriptyline and doxepin. While it acts to block both, imipramine displays a much higher affinity for the serotonin reuptake transporter than for the norepinephrine reuptake transporter [A6584]. Imipramine produces effects similar to other monoamine targeting antidepressants, increasing serotonin- and norepinephrine-based neurotransmission.\r\n\r\nThis modulation of neurotransmission produces a complex range of changes in brain structure and function along with an improvement in depressive symptoms. The changes include increases in hippocampal neurogenesis and reduced downregulation of this neurogenesis in response to stress [A31931]. These implicate brain derived neurotrophic factor signalling as a necessary contributor to antidepressant effect although the link to the direct increase in monoamine neurotransmission is unclear.\r\n\r\nSerotonin reuptake targeting agents may also produce a down-regulation in \u03b2-adrenergic receptors in the brain [A31938].",
    "mechanism-of-action": "Imipramine works by inhibiting the neuronal reuptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin [A6584,T116]. It binds the sodium-dependent serotonin transporter and sodium-dependent norepinephrine transporter reducing the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin by neurons. Depression has been linked to a lack of stimulation of the post-synaptic neuron by norepinephrine and serotonin [A31933]. Slowing the reuptake of these neurotransmitters increases their concentration in the synaptic cleft, producing knock-on effects in protein kinase signalling which is thought to contribute to changes in neurotransmission and brain physiology which relieves symptoms of depression [A31939]. ",
    "absorption": "Rapidly and well absorbed (>95%) after oral administration [A31907]. The primary site of absorption is the small intestine as the basic amine groups are ionized in the acidic environment of the stomach, preventing movement across tissues. Bioavailability ranges from 29-77% due to high inter-individual variability. Peak plasma concentration is usually attained 2-6 hours following oral administration. Absorption is unaffected by food. ",
    "metabolism": "Imipramine is nearly exclusively metabolized by the liver [A31907]. Imipramine is converted to desipramine by CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C19. Both imipramine and desipramine are hydroxylated by CYP2D6 [A31915]. Desipramine is an active metabolite.\r\n\r\nMinor metabolic pathways include dealkylation to form an imidodibenzyl product as well as demethylation of desipramine to didemethylimipramine and subsequent hydroxylation [A31907].\r\n\r\nLess than 5% of orally administered imipramine is excreted unchanged.",
    "toxicity": "The anticholinergic actvity of imipramine can produce dry mucous membranes, blurred vision, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthermia, constipation, adynamic ileus, urinary retention, delayed micturition, and dilation of the urinary tract [L1360].\r\n\r\nCentral nervous system and neuromuscular effects include drowsiness, lethargy, fatigue, agitation, excitement, nightmares, restlessness, insomnia, confusion, disturbed concentration, disorientation, delusions, and hallucinations.\r\n\r\nEffects on the GI tract include anorexia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, increases in pancreatic enzymes, epigastric distress, stomatitis, peculiar taste, and black tongue.\r\n\r\nRarely agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, eosinophilia, leukopenia, and purpura have occured.\r\n\r\nInfants whose mothers were receiving tricyclic antidepressants prior to delivery have experienced cardiac problems, irritability, respiratory distress, muscle spasms, seizures, and urinary retention.\r\n\r\nSerotonin syndrome can occur when used in conjunction with other pro-serotonergic drugs.\r\n\r\n### LD<sub>50</sub/> Values\r\nRat\r\n- Oral 250 mg/kg\r\n- Intraperitoneal 79mg/kg\r\n- Subcutaneous 250 mg/kg\r\n- Intravenous 15.9 mg/kg\r\n\r\nMouse \r\n- Oral 188 mg/kg\r\n- Intraperitoneal 51.6 mg/kg\r\n- Subcutaneous 195 \u03bcg/kg\r\n- Intravenous 21 mg/kg\r\n\r\nHuman range of toxicity is considered to include single dosages greater than 5 mg/kg.",
