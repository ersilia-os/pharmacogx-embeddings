    "description": "Vandetanib is an oral once-daily kinase inhibitor of tumour angiogenesis and tumour cell proliferation with the potential for use in a broad range of tumour types.\r\n\r\nOn April 6 2011, vandetanib was approved by the FDA to treat nonresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer in adult patients.",
    "indication": "Vandetanib is currently approved as an alternative to local therapies for both unresectable and disseminated disease. Because Vandetanib can prolong the Q-T interval, it is contraindicated for use in patients with serious cardiac complications such as congenital long QT syndrome and uncompensated heart failure. ",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Mean IC50 of approximately 2.1 \u03bcg/mL.",
    "mechanism-of-action": "ZD-6474 is a potent and selective inhibitor of VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor), EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and RET (REarranged during Transfection) tyrosine kinases. \r\n\r\nVEGFR- and EGFR-dependent signalling are both clinically validated pathways in cancer, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). RET activity is important in some types of thyroid cancer, and early data with vandetanib in medullary thyroid cancer has led to orphan-drug designation by the regulatory authorities in the USA and EU.\r\n",
    "absorption": "Slow- peak plasma concentrations reached at a median 6 hours. On multiple dosing, Vandetanib accumulates about 8 fold with steady state reached after around 3 months. ",
    "metabolism": "Unchanged vandentanib and metabolites vandetanib N-oxide and N-desmethyl vandetanib were detected in plasma, urine and feces.  N-desmethyl-vandetanib is primarily produced by CYP3A4, and vandetanib-N-oxide is primarily produced by flavin\u2013containing monooxygenase enzymes FMO1 and FMO3. ",
