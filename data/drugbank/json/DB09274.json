        "Artesunate"
    ],
    "description": "Artesunate is indicated for the initial treatment of severe malaria.[L14099] The World Health Organization recommends artesunate as first line treatment for severe malaria.[L890] Artesunate was developed out of a need for a more hydrophilic derivative of [artemisinin].[A203948]\r\n\r\nArtesunate was granted FDA approval on 26 May 2020.[L14099]",
    "indication": "Artesunate is indicated for the initial treatment of severe malaria in adult and pediatric patients.[L14099]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Artesunate is an artemisinin derivative that is metabolized to DHA, which generates free radicals to inhibit normal function of _Plasmodium_ parasites.[A18389,L891,L14099] It has a short duration of action due to its short half life, and a moderate therapeutic index.[L891,L14099] Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of post treatment hemolytic anemia and hypersenstivity.[L14099]",
    "mechanism-of-action": "Artesunate is metabolized to the active DHA.[L14099] the endoperoxide bridge of DHA reacts with heme, generating free radicals which inhibit protein and nucleic acid synthesis of the _Plasmodium_ parasites during all erythrocytic stages.[L14099,L891] Reactions with these free radicals can also lead to alkylation of parasitic proteins such as a calcium adenosine triphosphatase and EXP1, a glutathione S-transferase.[A18389,L891]",
    "absorption": "The C<sub>max</sub> of artesunate is 3.3\u00b5g/mL while the C<sub>max</sub> of the active metabolite DHA is 3.1\u00b5g/mL.[L14099] The AUC of artesunate is 0.7\u00b5g\\*h/mL while the AUC of DHA is 3.5\u00b5g\\*h/mL.[L14099] After intravenous artesunate, DHA has a T<sub>max</sub> of 0.5-15 minutes in adult patients and 21-64 minutes in pediatric patients.[L891] Intramuscular artesunate has a T<sub>max</sub> of 8-12 minutes.[L891] Infants less than 6 months old will have a higher AUC due to an undeveloped UGT metabolic pathway.[L14099]",
    "metabolism": "Artesunate is rapidly metabolized to dihydroartemisinin (DHA) by plasma esterases.[L14099] DHA is glucuronidated by UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 to DHA-glucuronide.[A203894,L14099] DHA-glucuronide can undergo a minor metabolic pathway to for a furano acetate derivative of DHA-glucuronide.[A203894] CYP2A6 may minorly contribute to the metabolism of artesunate.[L891]",
    "toxicity": "Data regarding overdoses of artesunate are rare.[L14099] Patients experiencing an overdose may present with pancytopenia, melena, seizures, multiorgan failure, and death.[L14099] Treat overdose with symptomatic and supportive measures.[L14099]",
