    "description": "Brivaracetam is a racetam derivative of levetiracetam used in the treatment of partial-onset seizures. Brivaracetam binds SV2A with 20 times higher affinity than levetiracetam [A19184]. It is available under the brand name Briviact made by UCB. Briviact received FDA approval on February 19, 2016 [L760].",
    "indication": "Used as adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures in patients 16 years of age or older.",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Brivaracetam binds SV2A with high affinity  [A19184]. SV2A is known to play a role in epileptogenesis through modulation of synaptic GABA release [A19185]. It is thought that brivaracetam exerts its anti-epileptogenic effects through its binding to SV2A. Brivaracetam is also known to inhibit Na+ channels which may also contribute to its anti-epileptogenic action [A19186].",
    "mechanism-of-action": "The precise mechanism of brivaracetam's anti-epileptogenic activity is unknown.",
    "absorption": "Nearly 100% oral bioavailability [A19180].",
    "metabolism": "Primarily metabolized by hydrolysis of the acetamide moeity  to form a carboxylic acid metabolite [A19188]. Another metabolite is created via oxidation of the propyl side chain by CYP2C8 as well as CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6. Some conjugation with glucuronic acid and taurine account for a small amount of metabolism.",
    "toxicity": "No carcinogenesis or fertility impairment found. Overdose is associated with somnolence and dizziness [FDA Label].",
