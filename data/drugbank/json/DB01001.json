    "description": "Salbutamol is a short-acting, selective beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist used in the treatment of asthma and COPD. It is 29 times more selective for beta2 receptors than beta1 receptors giving it higher specificity for pulmonary beta receptors versus beta1-adrenergic receptors located in the heart. Salbutamol is formulated as a racemic mixture of the R- and S-isomers. The R-isomer has 150 times greater affinity for the beta2-receptor than the S-isomer and the S-isomer has been associated with toxicity. This lead to the development of levalbuterol, the single R-isomer of salbutamol. However, the high cost of levalbuterol compared to salbutamol has deterred wide-spread use of this enantiomerically pure version of the drug. Salbutamol is generally used for acute episodes of bronchospasm caused by bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis and other chronic bronchopulmonary disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). It is also used prophylactically for exercise-induced asthma.[Label,A174379,A174400]",
    "indication": "Salbutamol is indicated for (i) the symptomatic relief and prevention of bronchospasm due to bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis, reversible obstructive airway disease, and other chronic bronchopulmonary disorders in which bronchospasm is a complicating factor, and/or (ii) the acute prophylaxis against exercise-induced bronchospasm and other stimuli known to induce bronchospasm.[Label,F3265,F3268]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Salbutamol (INN) or albuterol (USAN), a moderately selective beta(2)-receptor agonist similar in structure to terbutaline, is widely used as a bronchodilator to manage asthma and other chronic obstructive airway diseases.[Label,F3265,F3268] The R-isomer, levalbuterol, is responsible for bronchodilation while the S-isomer increases bronchial reactivity.[A174400] The R-enantiomer is available and sold in its pure form as levalbuterol and subsequently may produce fewer side-effects with only the R-enantiomer present - although this has not been formally demonstrated.[A174400]\r\n\r\nAfter oral and parenteral administration, stimulation of the beta receptors in the body, both beta-1 and beta-2, occurs because (a) beta-2 selectivity is not absolute, and (b) higher concentrations of salbutamol occur in the regions of these receptors with these modes of administration.[Label,F3265,F3268] This results in the beta-1 effect of cardiac stimulation, though not so much as with isoprenaline, and beta-2 effects of peripheral vasodilatation and hypotension, skeletal muscle tremor, and uterine muscle relaxation.[Label,F3265,F3268]\r\n\r\nMetabolic effects such as hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia also may occur, although it is not known whether these effects are mediated by beta-1 or beta-2 receptors.[Label,F3265,F3268] The serum potassium levels have a tendency to fall.[F3265]",
    "mechanism-of-action": "In vitro studies and in vivo pharmacologic studies have shown that salbutamol has a preferential effect on beta2-adrenergic receptors compared with isoproterenol.[Label,F3265,F3268] Although beta2\u00ad adrenoceptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta1 adrenoceptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also beta2-adrenoceptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta-adrenoceptors.[Label,F3265,F3268] The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but their presence raises the possibility that even selective beta2-agonists may have cardiac effects.[Label,F3265,F3268]\r\n\r\nActivation of beta2-adrenergic receptors on airway smooth muscle leads to the activation of adenyl cyclase and to an increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic-3\u2032,5\u2032-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP).[Label,F3265,F3268] This increase of cyclic AMP leads to the activation of protein kinase A, which inhibits the phosphorylation of myosin and lowers intracellular ionic calcium concentrations, resulting in relaxation.[Label,F3265,F3268] Salbutamol relaxes the smooth muscles of all airways, from the trachea to the terminal bronchioles.[Label,F3265,F3268] Salbutamol acts as a functional antagonist to relax the airway irrespective of the spasmogen involved, thus protecting against all bronchoconstrictor challenges.[Label,F3265,F3268] Increased cyclic AMP concentrations are also associated with the inhibition of release of mediators from mast cells in the airway.[Label,F3265,F3268]\r\n\r\nSalbutamol has been shown in most controlled clinical trials to have more effect on the respiratory tract, in the form of bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, than isoproterenol at comparable doses while producing fewer cardiovascular effects.[Label,F3265,F3268] Controlled clinical studies and other clinical experience have shown that inhaled albuterol, like other beta-adrenergic agonist drugs, can produce a significant cardiovascular effect in some patients, as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, symptoms, and/or electrocardiographic changes.[Label,F3265,F3268]\r\n\r\nA measurable decrease in airway resistance is typically observed within 5 to 15 minutes after inhalation of salbutamol.[Label,F3265,F3268] The maximum improvement in pulmonary function usually occurs 60 to 90 minutes after salbutamol treatment, and significant bronchodilator activity has been observed to persist for 3 to 6 hours.[Label,F3265,F3268] ",
    "absorption": "Following inhalation, salbutamol acts topically on bronchial smooth muscle and the drug is initially undetectable in the blood.[F3265] After 2 to 3 hours low concentrations are seen, due presumably to the portion of the dose which is swallowed and absorbed in the gut.[F3265]\r\n\r\nIn particular, the systemic levels of salbutamol are low after inhalation of recommended doses.[Label] A trial conducted in 12 healthy male and female subjects using a higher dose (1,080 mcg of albuterol base) showed that mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 3 ng/mL occurred after dosing when salbutamol was delivered using propellant HFA-134a.[Label] The mean time to peak concentrations (Tmax) was delayed after administration of VENTOLIN (salbutamol) HFA (Tmax = 0.42 hours) as compared with CFC-propelled salbutamol inhaler (Tmax = 0.17 hours).[Label] ",
    "metabolism": "Salbutamol is not metabolized in the lung but is converted in the liver to the 4'-o-sulphate (salbutamol 4'-O-sulfate) ester, which has negligible pharmacologic activity.[F3265,F3268] It may also be metabolized by oxidative deamination and/or conjugation with glucuronide.[F3265,F3268] Salbutamol is ultimately excreted in the urine as free drug and as the metabolite.[F3265,F3268]",
    "toxicity": "The expected signs and symptoms with overdosage of albuterol are those of excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation and/or occurrence or exaggeration of any of the signs and symptoms of beta-adrenergic stimulation (e.g., seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats/min, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, insomnia, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis).[Label] In particular, the signs of salbutamol overdosage are significant tachycardia and/or significant muscle tremor.[F3265,F3268]\r\n\r\nHypokalaemia may occur following overdosage with salbutamol.[F3265] Serum potassium levels should be monitored.[F3265]\r\n\r\nLactic acidosis has been reported in association with high therapeutic doses as well as overdoses of short-acting beta-agonist therapy, therefore monitoring for elevated serum lactate and consequent metabolic acidosis (particularly if there is persistence or worsening of tachypnea despite resolution of other signs of bronchospasm such as wheezing) may be indicated in the setting of overdose.[F3265,F3268]\r\n\r\nSalbutamol is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.[Label] There are no adequate and well-controlled trials with salbutamolc or albuterol sulfate in pregnant women.[Label] During worldwide marketing experience, various congenital anomalies, including cleft palate and limb defects, have been reported in the offspring of patients being treated with salbutamol.[Label] Some of the mothers were taking multiple medications during their pregnancies.[Label] No consistent pattern of defects can be discerned, and a relationship between salbutamol use and congenital anomalies has not been established.[Label] Animal reproduction studies in mice and rabbits revealed evidence of teratogenicity.[Label] Salbutamol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetusLabel]. Women should be advised to contact their physicians if they become pregnant while taking salbutamol.[Label]\r\n\r\nSince there exists a potential for beta-agonist interference with uterine contractility, the use of salbutamol during labour should be restricted to those patients in whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risk.[Label]\r\n\r\nPlasma levels of albuterol sulfate and HFA-134a after inhaled therapeutic doses are very low in humans, but it is not known whether the components of salbutamol are excreted in human milk.[Label] Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for albuterol in animal studies and lack of experience with the use of salbutamol by nursing mothers, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.[Label] Caution should be exercised when salbutamol is administered to a nursing woman.[Label] \r\n\r\nThe safety and effectiveness of salbutamol in children younger than 4 years of age has not yet been established.[Label]\r\n\r\nClinical trials of VENTOLIN HFA did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether older subjects respond differently than younger subjects.[Label] Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.[Label] In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.[Label] \r\n\r\nThe LD<sub>50</sub> value was determined to be 1100 mg/kg (orally in mice).",
