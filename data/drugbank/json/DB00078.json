    "description": "Indium or yttrium conjugated murine IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen, which is found on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes. Ibritumomab is produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells and is composed of two murine gamma 1 heavy chains of 445 amino acids each and two kappa light chains of 213 amino acids each.",
    "indication": "For treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Ibritumomab is a murine monoclonal antibody against CD20 that has been radiolabeled with yttrium-90.",
    "mechanism-of-action": "The Fab segment of the antibody targets the CD20 epitope on B-cells, allowing the radioactive yttrium to destroy the cell via production of beta particles.",
    "absorption": null,
    "metabolism": "Most likely removed by opsonization via the reticuloendothelial system when bound to B cells, or by human antimurine antibody production",
    "toxicity": null,
