    "description": "A phenothiazine used in the treatment of psychoses. Its properties and uses are generally similar to those of chlorpromazine.",
    "indication": "For management of manifestations of psychotic disorders.",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Fluphenazine is a trifluoro-methyl phenothiazine derivative intended for the management of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Fluphenazine has not been shown effective in the management of behaviorial complications in patients with mental retardation.",
    "mechanism-of-action": "Fluphenazine blocks postsynaptic mesolimbic dopaminergic D1 and D2 receptors in the brain; depresses the release of hypothalamic and hypophyseal hormones and is believed to depress the reticular activating system thus affecting basal metabolism, body temperature, wakefulness, vasomotor tone, and emesis.",
