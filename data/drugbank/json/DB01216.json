    "description": "Finasteride is a synthetic 4-azasteroid compound [L10565] and specific inhibitor of steroid Type II 5\u03b1-reductase, which is an intracellular enzyme that converts the androgen testosterone into 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It works in a similar fashion as [dutasteride], which is another 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, by exerting antiandrogenic effects. Finasteride is an orally active drug that was first approved by the FDA in 1992 for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia to improve symptoms and reduce the risk for acute urinary retention or the need for surgical procedures.[L6244,L10565] In 1998, it was approved by the FDA to treat male pattern hair loss.[L6244] Finasteride is commonly marketed under the brand names Propecia and Proscar to be used aloneo or in combination with [doxazosin], an alpha-blocker.\r\n\r\nBoth benign prostatic hyperplasia and androgenic alopecia are androgen-dependent disorders that are characterized by _in situ_ high levels of DHT.[A178159] In the treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia, alpha-blockers such as [tamsulosin] and [terazosin] are also used. Compared to alpha-blockers that focus on providing the rapid relief of symptoms, 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors aim to target the underlying disease by blocking the effects of the primary androgen involved in benign prostate hyperplasia and androgenic alopecia, thus reducing the risk for secondary complications while providing symptom control.[A2132]",
    "indication": "Finasteride is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men with an enlarged prostate to improve symptoms, reduce the risk of acute urinary retention, and reduce the risk of the need for surgery including transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and prostatectomy.[L10565] A combination product with [tadalafil] is also used for the symptomatic treatment of BPH for up to 26 weeks.[L39439]\r\n\r\nFinasteride is also indicated for the treatment of male pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia, hereditary alopecia, or common male baldness) in male patients.[L6235]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Finasteride is an antiandrogenic compound that works by suppressing the production of serum and intraprostatic dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in men via inhibiting the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of DHT. The maximum effect of a rapid reduction in serum DHT concentration is expected to be observed 8 hours following administration of the first dose.[L10565] In a single man receiving a single oral dose of 5 mg finasteride for up to 4 years, there was a reduction in the serum DHT concentrations by approximately 70% and the median circulating level of testosterone increased by approximately 10-20% within the physiologic range. [L10565] In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, finasteride reduced intraprostatic DHT level by 91.4% but finasteride is not expected to decrease the DHT levels to castrate levels since circulating testosterone is also converted to DHT by the type 1 isoenzyme expressed in other tissues.[A2132] It is expected that DHT levels return to normal within 14 days upon discontinuation of the drug.[L6244] In a study of male patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia prior to prostatectomy, the treatment with finasteride resulted in an approximate 80% lower DHT content was measured in prostatic tissue removed at surgery compared to placebo.[L10565] While finasteride reduces the size of the prostate gland by 20%, this may not correlate well with improvement in symptoms.[A178273] The effects of finasteride are reported to be more pronounced in male patients with enlarged prostates (>25 mL) who are at the greatest risk of disease progression.[A2132]\r\n\r\nIn phase III clinical studies, oral administration of finasteride in male patients with male pattern hair loss promoted hair growth and prevented further hair loss by 66% and 83% of the subjects, respectively, which lasted during two years' treatment.[A178222] The incidences of these effects in treatment groups were significantly higher than that of the group receiving a placebo.[A178222] Following finasteride administration, the levels of DHT in the scalp skin was shown to be reduced by more than 60%, indicating that the DHT found in scalp is derived from both local DHT production and circulating DHT.[A178195] The effect of finasteride on scalp DHT is likely seen because of its effect on both local follicular DHT levels as well as serum DHT levels.[A178195]. There is evidence from early clinical observations and controlled studies that finasteride may reduce bleeding of prostatic origin.[A178183]",
    "mechanism-of-action": "Finasteride acts as a competitive and specific inhibitor of Type II 5\u03b1-reductase, a nuclear-bound steroid intracellular enzyme primarily located in the prostatic stromal cell that converts the androgen testosterone into the more active metabolite, 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone (DHT).[A2132] DHT is considered to be the primary androgen playing a role in the development and enlargement of the prostate gland. It serves as the hormonal mediator for the hyperplasia upon accumulation within the prostate gland.[A178270] DHT displays a higher affinity towards androgen receptors in the prostate gland compared to testosterone[T28] and by acting on the androgen receptors, DHT modulates genes that are responsible for cell proliferation.[A178279] Responsible for the production of DHT together with type I 5\u03b1-reductase, the type II 5\u03b1-reductase isozyme is primarily found in the prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymides, and hair follicles as well as liver.[L6235] Although finasteride is 100-fold more selective for type II 5\u03b1-reductase than for the type I isoenzyme,[A178183] chronic treatment with this drug may have some effect on type I 5\u03b1-reductase, which is predominantly expressed in sebaceous glands of most regions of skin, including the scalp, and liver. It is proposed that the type I 5\u03b1-reductase and type II 5\u03b1-reductase is responsible for the production of one-third and two-thirds of circulating DHT, respectively. \r\n\r\nThe mechanism of action of Finasteride is based on its preferential inhibition of Type II 5\u03b1-reductase through the formation of a stable complex with the enzyme _in vitro_ and _in vivo_.[L10565] Finasteride works selectively, where it preferentially displays a 100-fold selectivity for the human Type II 5\u03b1-reductase over type I enzyme.[L6235] Inhibition of Type II 5\u03b1-reductase blocks the peripheral conversion of testosterone to DHT, resulting in significant decreases in serum and tissue DHT concentrations, minimal to moderate increase in serum testosterone concentrations, and substantial increases in prostatic testosterone concentrations. As DHT appears to be the principal androgen responsible for stimulation of prostatic growth, a decrease in DHT concentrations will result in a decrease in prostatic volume (approximately 20-30% after 6-24 months of continued therapy). It is suggested that increased levels of DHT can lead to potentiated transcription of prostaglandin D2, which promotes the proliferation of prostate cancer cells.[A178189] In men with androgenic alopecia, the mechanism of action has not been fully determined, but finasteride has shown to decrease scalp DHT concentration to the levels found in the hairy scalp, reduce serum DHT, increase hair regrowth, and slow hair loss. Another study suggests that finasteride may work to reduce bleeding of prostatic origin by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the prostate, leading to atrophy and programmed cell death.[A178183] This may bestow the drug therapeutic benefits in patients idiopathic prostatic bleeding, bleeding during anticoagulation, or bleeding after instrumentation.[A178183]",
    "absorption": "Finasteride is well absorbed following oral administration [T28] and displays a slow accumulation phase after multiple dosing.[lablel] In healthy male subjects receiving oral finasteride, the mean oral bioavailability was 65% for 1 mg finasteride and 63% for 5 mg finasteride, and the values ranged from 26 to 170% for 1 mg dose and from 34 to 108% for 5 mg dose, respectively.[L6235,L10565] It is reported that food intake does not affect the oral bioavailability of the drug.[A178195] The peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) averaged 37 ng/mL (range, 27-49 ng/mL) and was reached 1-2 hours post administration.[L10565] The AUC(0-24 hr) was 53 ngxhr/mL (range, 20-154 ngxhr/mL).[L6235] The plasma concentrations and AUC are reported to be higher in elderly male patients aged 70 years or older.[L6235]",
    "metabolism": "Finasteride undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism predominantly mediated by the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme to form the t-butyl side chain monohydroxylated and monocarboxylic acid metabolites.[A178195, L10565] Theses metabolites retain less than 20% of the pharmacological activity of the parent compound.[L10565]",
    "toxicity": "**LD50**\r\n\r\nOral LD50 is about 418 mg/kg in rats[MSDS] and there have been cases of lethality in rats receiving a single oral dose of 400 mg/kg in males and 1000 mg/kg in females.[L10565] \r\n\r\n**Nonclinical toxicology**\r\n\r\nIn a 24-month rat study, there were no signs of the tumorigenic potential of finasteride.[L6235] In a 19-month carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, high doses of finasteride, at 1824 times the human exposure (250 mg/kg/day), resulted in an increase in the incidence of testicular Leydig cell adenomas and an increase in serum LH levels.[L6235] _In vitro_ mutagenesis assays demonstrated no evidence of mutagenicity. In an in vitro chromosome aberration assay, using Chinese hamster ovary cells, there was a slight increase in chromosome aberrations with much higher doses of finasteride.[L6235] \r\n\r\n**Overdose**\r\n\r\nThere were no reported significant adverse events in clinical trials of male patients receiving single oral doses of finasteride up to 400 mg and multiple doses of finasteride up to 80 mg/day for three months.[L6235] As there have been no cases of overdose or clinically significant toxicity with finasteride, there are no specific recommendations in case of an overdose.[L10565]\r\n\r\n**Significant adverse events**\r\n\r\nCommon reproductive adverse events seen with finasteride therapy include erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction, and loss of libido.[A178195] These adverse events tend to disappear after discontinuation or chronic use of the drug. Only causal adverse event occurring at the male reproductive system that is caused by finasteride is decreased ejaculatory volume because of the predominant action of DHT on the prostate.[A178195]\r\n\r\n**Special populations**\r\n\r\nFinasteride can be safely used in elderly patients or those with renal impairment with no specific dosing adjustment recommendations.[L10565] Finasteride is indicated for male patients only, and it is advised that exposure to finasteride is avoided in pregnant women carrying male fetuses as it may lead to abnormal development of external genitalia in male fetuses.[L6235]",
