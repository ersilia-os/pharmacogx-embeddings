    "description": "Apomorphine is a non-ergoline dopamine D2 agonist indicated to treat hypomobility associated with Parkinson's. It was first synthesized in 1845 and first used in Parkinson's disease in 1884.[A203618] Apomorphine has also been investigated as an emetic, a sedative, a treatment for alcoholism, and a treatment of other movement disorders.[A203597,A203618]\r\n\r\nApomorphine was granted FDA approval on 20 April 2004.[L13919]",
    "indication": "Apomorphine is indicated to treat acute, intermittent treatment of hypomobility, off episodes associated with advanced Parkinson's disease.[L13919,L13922]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Apomorphine is a dopaminergic agonist that may stimulate regions of the brain involved in motor control.[A203594,L13919,L13922] It has a short duration of action and a wide therapeutic index as large overdoses are necessary for significant toxicity.[L13919,L13922] Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of nausea, vomiting, daytime somnolence, hypotension, oral mucosal irritation, falls, hallucinations, psychotic-like behaviour, impulsive behaviour, withdrawal hyperpyrexia, and prolongation of the QT interval.[L13919,L13922]\r\n\r\nGiven the incidence of nausea and vomiting in patients taking apomorphine, treatment with [trimethobenzamide] may be recommended prior to or during therapy. Antiemetic pretreatment may be started three days prior to beginning therapy with apomorphine - it should only be continued as long as is necessary and generally for no longer than two months.[L41915]",
    "mechanism-of-action": "Apomorphine is a non-ergoline dopamine agonist with high binding affinity to dopamine D2, D3, and D5 receptors.[L13919,L13922] Stimulation of D2 receptors in the caudate-putamen, a region of the brain responsible for locomotor control, may be responsible for apomorphine's action.[A203594] However, the means by which the cellular effects of apomorphine treat hypomobility of Parkinson's remain unknown.[L13919,L13922]",
    "absorption": "Apomorphine has a plasma T<sub>max</sub> of 10-20 minutes and a cerebrospinal fluid T<sub>max</sub>.[A203549] The C<sub>max</sub> and AUC of apomorphine vary significantly between patients, with 5- to 10-fold differences being reported.[A203549,A203405]",
    "metabolism": "Apomorphine is N-demethylated by CYP2B6, 2C8, 3A4, and 3A5.[L13919] It can be glucuronidated by various UGTs,[L13919] or sulfated by SULTs 1A1, 1A2, 1A3, 1E1, and 1B1.[A203447] Approximately 60% of sublingual apomorphine is eliminated as a sulfate conjugate, though the structure of these sulfate conjugates are not readily available.[A203447,L13919] The remainder of an apomorphine dose is eliminated as apomorphine glucuronide and norapomorphine glucuronide.[L13919] Only 0.3% of subcutaneous apomorphine is recovered as the unchanged parent drug.[A203402]",
    "toxicity": "Patients experiencing an overdose of apomorphine may present with nausea, hypotension, and loss of consciousness.[L13919] Treat patients with symptomatic and supportive measures.\r\n\r\nThe intraperitoneal LD<sub>50</sub> in mice is 145\u00b5g/kg.[L14012]",
