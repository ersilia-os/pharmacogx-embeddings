    "description": "Nortriptyline hydrochloride, the active metabolite of [amitriptyline], is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA).[L11878] It is used in the treatment of major depression and is also used off-label for chronic pain and other conditions.[L11881]",
    "indication": "Nortriptyline is indicated for the relief of the symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD).[L11878] Some off-label uses for this drug include treatment of chronic pain, myofascial pain, neuralgia, and irritable bowel syndrome.[A191083,L11878]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Nortriptyline exerts antidepressant effects likely by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine at neuronal cell membranes. It also exerts antimuscarinic effects through its actions on the acetylcholine receptor.[L11878,L11881]",
    "mechanism-of-action": "Though prescribing information does not identify a specific mechanism of action for nortriptyline[L11878], is believed that nortriptyline either inhibits the reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin at the neuronal membrane or acts at the level of the beta-adrenergic receptors. It displays a more selective reuptake inhibition for noradrenaline, which may explain increased symptom improvement after nortriptyline therapy.[T28] Tricyclic antidepressants do not inhibit monoamine oxidase nor do they affect dopamine reuptake.[L11878] As with other tricyclics, nortriptyline displays affinity for other receptors including mACh receptors, histamine receptors, 5-HT receptors, in addition to other receptors.[A18198,A4909,T28] ",
    "absorption": "Nortriptyline is readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract with extensive variation in plasma levels, depending on the patient. This drug undergoes first-pass metabolism and its plasma concentrations are attained within 7 to 8.5 hours after oral administration.[L11899] The bioavailability of nortriptyline varies considerably and ranges from 45 to 85%.[A191167,L11911]",
    "metabolism": "Nortriptyline is metabolized via demethylation and hydroxylation in the liver followed by glucuronic acid conjugation. CYP2D6 plays a large role in nortriptyline metabolism, with contributions from CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4.[A15182,L11878,A14832] The main active metabolite is 10-hydroxynortriptyline exists in both cis and a trans form, with the trans form is higher in potency.  10-hydroxynortriptyline is the most frequently found in the plasma. Most of the other metabolites are conjugated, and are less potent.[L11911]",
    "toxicity": "The oral LD50 of nortriptyline in the rat is 405 mg/kg.[L11920]Symptoms of overdose with nortriptyline include cardiac arrhythmias, severe hypotension, shock, congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, convulsions, coma, and CNS depression.[L11878,L11899] Changes in the electrocardiogram, particularly in QRS segment, may be indicative of tricyclic antidepressant toxicity.[A191170] ",
