    "description": "A very toxic anthracycline aminoglycoside antineoplastic isolated from Streptomyces peucetius and others, used in treatment of leukemia and other neoplasms.",
    "indication": "For remission induction in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (myelogenous, monocytic, erythroid) of adults and for remission induction in acute lymphocytic leukemia of children and adults.\r\n\r\nDaunorubicin is indicated in combination with [cytarabine] for the treatment of newly-diagnosed therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC) in adults and pediatric patients 1 year and older.[L32843]",
    "pharmacodynamics": "Daunorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic and antineoplastic agent.[L32843] It acts by inhibiting cellular reproduction through interference with DNA replication although it may contribute to the induction of cell death by increasing oxidative stress through the generation of reactive oxygen species and free radicals. As an antineoplastic agent, daunorubicin carries significant toxicities including cytopenias, hepatotoxicity, and extravasation reactions. Like other anthracyclines, daunorubicin also exhibits cardiotoxicity in proportion with the cumulative dose received over time.",
    "mechanism-of-action": "Daunorubicin has antimitotic and cytotoxic activity through a number of proposed mechanisms of action: Daunorubicin forms complexes with DNA by intercalation between base pairs, and it inhibits topoisomerase II activity by stabilizing the DNA-topoisomerase II complex, preventing the religation portion of the ligation-religation reaction that topoisomerase II catalyzes.",
    "absorption": "Daunorubicin was found to have a tmax of 2 h and a cmax of 24.8 \u03bcg/mL after a 90 min infusion of the liposomal formulation at a dose of 44 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. [A237405]",
