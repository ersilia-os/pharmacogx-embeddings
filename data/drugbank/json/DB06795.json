    "description": "Mafenide is a sulfonamide-type antimicrobial agent used to treat severe burns. It acts by reducing the bacterial population present in the burn tissue and promotes healing of deep burns.[L36773] In 1998, mafenide acetate was approved under the FDA\u2019s accelerated approval regulations. In November 2022, the use of mafenide acetate (powder for 5% topical solution) was withdrawn by the FDA due to an unresolved confirmatory study required to fulfill the accelerated approval requirements.[L44251]",
    "indication": "Indicated for use as an adjunctive topical antimicrobial agent to control bacterial infection when used under moist dressings over meshed autografts on excised burn wounds.[label]",
    "pharmacodynamics": null,
    "mechanism-of-action": "The precise mechanism of mafenide is unknown. However, mafenide reduces the bacterial population in the avascular burn tissue and promotes spontaneous heeling of deep burns. ",
    "absorption": "Mafenide is absorbed through devascularized areas into the systemic circulation following topical administration.",
    "metabolism": "Metabolized to a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor.",
    "toxicity": "Since mafenide is metabolized to a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, metabolic acidosis could occur. ",
