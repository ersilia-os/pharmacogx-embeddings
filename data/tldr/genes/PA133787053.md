## Gene Summary
GSTO2, officially known as Glutathione S-Transferase Omega 2, belongs to the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family, which plays a key role in cellular detoxification by catalyzing the conjugation of glutathione to a wide variety of endogenous and exogenous electrophilic compounds. GSTO2, similar to other members of the GST family, is involved in the metabolism and detoxification of reactive oxygen species and xenobiotics. GSTO2 is expressed in various human tissues, including the liver, kidney, and brain, playing a potentially important role in the protection against oxidative stress and the detoxification of various substrates including heavy metals.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
GSTO2 has been studied for its role in various physiological and pathological processes. Research indicates involvement in the metabolism of arsenic, a known environmental toxin, which implicates potential relevance in arsenic-induced diseases. Moreover, the role of GSTO2 in detoxifying oxidative stress may link it to conditions like Alzheimer's disease and possibly other neurodegenerative disorders. Notably, its expression and activity could influence the pathology or progression of these diseases due to its involvement in handling oxidative products which are often elevated in such conditions.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, GSTO2's relevance is emerging, particularly concerning individual variations in response to drugs and susceptibility to toxicity. Although specific drug associations are not as extensively documented for GSTO2 as for some other genes in the GST family, its role in metabolizing environmental toxins like arsenic suggests potential implications for drugs with similar metabolism pathways or those generating oxidative stress. Understanding the genetic variations in GSTO2 could therefore be crucial in predicting patient responses to such drugs, especially in developing precision medicine approaches for treatments involving oxidative stress or heavy metal toxicity. Further research into GSTO2 could unveil more direct associations with pharmacological agents and their metabolism.
