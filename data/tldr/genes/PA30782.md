## Gene Summary
MGAT4A, or Mannosyl (alpha-1,3-)-glycoprotein beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase A, is involved in the glycosylation process,which is crucial for the function and structural integrity of proteins. Specifically, MGAT4A catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine to the mannose residues on nascent glycoproteins in the Golgi apparatus. This action is part of the formation of complex-type oligosaccharides in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins. MGAT4A expression varies, but it is prominently noted in the kidney and liver tissues.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
MGAT4A has been implicated in the pathway of protein glycosylation, specifically in the N-glycan biosynthesis process. Impairments or modifications in this pathway can affect protein folding, stability, and cell-cell interaction. Although directly MGAT4A has not been linked to specific diseases, its general pathway involvement suggests potential implications in disorders characterized by glycosylation defects, which may include certain types of congenital glycosylation disorders, muscular disorders, and neurological diseases.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there is limited specific pharmacogenetic data on MGAT4A relating to its direct interactions with drugs. However, understanding the gene's function in glycoprotein biosynthesis can be critical in the broader context of biotherapeutics, particularly in designing and improving the efficacy and safety profile of glycosylated therapeutic proteins. Drugs that target pathways involving protein glycosylation might indirectly be affected by the activity of MGAT4A, although direct associations and impacts need further elucidation through clinical and pharmacogenomic research.
