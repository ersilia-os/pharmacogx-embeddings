## Gene Summary
ABL1, or Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1, encodes a protein that is involved in various cellular processes including cell differentiation, division, adhesion, and stress response. The ABL1 protein is a tyrosine kinase, which contributes to its role in signaling pathways that regulate the cell cycle and apoptosis. This gene is highly expressed in a variety of tissues but is particularly noted in neuronal tissues. The protein's activity is negatively regulated via its SH3 domain, and dysregulation can lead to oncogenic effects.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ABL1 is famously implicated in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), where a chromosomal translocation produces the BCR-ABL fusion protein, possessing constitutively active tyrosine kinase activity that is central to the pathogenesis of CML. The gene is also associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The main pathway involving ABL1 is the tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, crucial for cell cycle and apoptosis regulation. ABL1â€™s role in cancer is primarily due to its impact on cell proliferation and survival, making it a significant target for anticancer drugs.

## Pharmacogenetics
ABL1's pharmacogenetic profile is prominently marked by its interaction with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), specifically in the treatment of CML. Drugs like Imatinib, Dasatinib, and Nilotinib target the BCR-ABL fusion protein, which results from the t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation involving ABL1 gene. The response to these drugs can vary based on specific mutations within the ABL1 kinase domain, influencing treatment outcomes. For instance, the T315I mutation in ABL1 confers resistance to Imatinib and other first-line TKIs, necessitating the use of the more potent inhibitor Ponatinib. Understanding these pharmacogenetic variables is crucial in optimizing therapeutic strategies and outcomes in leukemia treatment involving ABL1 and its fusion proteins.
