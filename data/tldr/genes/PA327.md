## Gene Summary
SLC19A1, also known as solute carrier family 19 member 1, is a gene that encodes a protein functioning primarily as a transporter of folate vitamins and antifolates. It is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues with high expression levels seen in the liver and kidneys. The SLC19A1 protein is integral to the cellular uptake of folate, which is critical for numerous biochemical processes including DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation. This gene plays a vital role in maintaining normal cellular function and development.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SLC19A1 is directly involved in the transport and effectiveness of certain drugs, especially those used in chemotherapy such as methotrexate, a commonly used antifolate drug. This gene is also associated with diseases related to folate metabolism, such as megaloblastic anemia, and more broadly impacts conditions that involve rapid cell division. It impacts various metabolic pathways including the folate metabolism pathway and folate bioavailability, which are crucial in epigenetic modifications and during periods of rapid cellular division such as during embryonic development.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, SLC19A1 is significant due to its role in drug efficacy and toxicity, particularly in the context of methotrexate treatment. Variants in SLC19A1 have been linked to differences in methotrexate pharmacokinetics and response rates, influencing both therapeutic outcomes and adverse effects in treatments of cancers and autoimmune diseases. For instance, certain polymorphisms in SLC19A1 can lead to altered drug transport activity, potentially resulting in decreased drug effectiveness or increased toxicity. This relevance makes SLC19A1 a target for therapeutic drug monitoring and a candidate for personalized medicine approaches, particularly in optimizing methotrexate dosing in cancer therapy and rheumatoid arthritis management.
