## Gene Summary
CFAP44, or Cilia and Flagella Associated Protein 44, is a gene involved in the structure and function of cilia and flagella. Cilia and flagella are slender, microscopic structures that extend from the surface of many animal cells. They play crucial roles in motility, fluid dynamics, and sensory functions. CFAP44 is specifically linked to the assembly and stability of the axonemal dynein arms, which are essential for the beating functions of cilia and flagella. While details about its expression patterns are still being elucidated, it is known to be crucial in cells that possess cilia or flagella, including respiratory epithelial cells and sperm cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in CFAP44 have been associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder characterized by chronic respiratory tract infections, abnormal organ positioning, and fertility issues due to impaired motility of cilia and flagella. The clinical manifestations of PCD result from the failure of cilia to effectively clear mucus and debris from the respiratory tract and the dysfunction in the flagellar movement of sperm cells. CFAP44 operates within the signaling pathways that govern the proper formation and function of cilia, engaging in the dynamic regulation of the dynein arm complexes necessary for ciliary beat frequency and waveform.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there is limited information available on the direct pharmacogenetic associations involving CFAP44 and specific drugs. Research in this area is still in the early stages, primarily focusing on understanding the genetic pathways and cellular mechanisms influenced by CFAP44. As knowledge of the gene's function expands, potential pharmacogenetic applications might emerge, especially concerning treatments targeting ciliary function and health in diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia. Future pharmacogenetic insights could lead to personalized medical approaches based on genetic profiles involving CFAP44 mutations or variants.
