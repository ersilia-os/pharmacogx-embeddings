## Gene Summary
TANC1, or tetratricopeptide repeat, ankyrin repeat and coiled-coil containing 1, is a gene encoded in humans on chromosome 13. TANC1 is primarily involved in synaptic functions, neuronal development, and is implicated in the regulation of dendritic morphology and synaptic plasticity. The protein encoded by TANC1 contains multiple functional domains, including tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), ankyrin repeats, and a coiled-coil domain, suggesting a role in mediating protein-protein interactions within neuronal cells. The geneâ€™s expression is mostly detected in brain tissues, particularly in regions associated with cognitive functions and memory formation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
While not extensively linked to specific drugs or diseases in mainstream databases, TANC1 plays a significant role in neurological development pathways. Studies have suggested its involvement in pathways that influence synapse organization and dopamine receptor signaling, which are crucial for neural transmission and brain functionality. Mutations or dysregulation in the expression of TANC1 could potentially lead to neurological phenotypes, impacting cognitive and synaptic functions although direct associations with specific diseases require further clinical validation. 

## Pharmacogenetics
As of the current research, TANC1 has not been significantly highlighted in the context of pharmacogenetics with direct associations with therapeutic drugs. It hasn't been documented extensively in pharmacogenetic databases or described in terms of individual variations influencing drug response or efficacy. However, given its involvement in synaptic signaling pathways, future research could potentially explore TANC1 as a candidate for influencing responses to neuroactive drugs, such as those used in treating psychiatric or neurological disorders. Further studies are needed to establish any pharmacogenetic implications fully.
