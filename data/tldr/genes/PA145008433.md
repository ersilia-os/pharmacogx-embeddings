## Gene Summary
METTL21A, officially known as Methyltransferase Like 21A, is a gene involved in the methylation of target proteins, which plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression, protein function, and protein-protein interactions. The METTL21A enzyme specifically acts as a protein lysine methyltransferase, modifying histones and potentially other substrates to influence their activity, stability, and localization. Expression of METTL21A has been found in various tissues, with notable levels in muscle tissues, playing pertinent roles in muscle function and maintenance.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
While METTL21A has not been extensively linked with specific drugs or major diseases directly, its role in post-translational modifications implicates it in essential biological pathways and possible muscle-related phenotypes. The enzymatic activity of METTL21A in histone methylation suggests a significant contribution to the epigenetic regulation mechanisms that can influence cellular functions and potentially impact disease states or developmental processes. Further studies could elucidate its specific roles in disease mechanisms or drug responses, especially concerning muscle physiology and related disorders.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, detailed pharmacogenetics associations involving METTL21A are sparse. This gene has not yet been significantly tied to variations affecting drug response or metabolism in standard clinical settings. However, given its biochemical function as a methyltransferase, future discoveries may link METTL21A to pharmacogenetic profiles, particularly concerning drugs that affect chromatin dynamics or muscle function. Continued research could potentially uncover relevant METTL21A variations influencing the individual responses to such therapies, paving the way for more effective, personalized therapeutic strategies.
