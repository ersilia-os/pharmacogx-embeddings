## Gene Summary
CYP4F8 is a gene that encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes, which are involved in the oxidation of various substrates in the metabolism of xenobiotics and drugs. Located mainly in epithelial cells of the prostate, skin, and cornea, CYP4F8 specifically contributes to the omega-hydroxylation of fatty acids and leukotriene B4, a potent mediator of inflammation. The gene falls within a cluster of cytochrome P450 genes on chromosome 19.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CYP4F8 is implicated in the metabolic processing of eicosanoids, which play extensive roles in inflammation, and in skin and eye diseases owing to its expression in related tissues. Mutations and dysregulation of this gene have been associated with disorders like essential fatty acid metabolism issues and change in drug efficacy and toxicity in personalized medicine approaches. Pathways involving CYP4F8 include fatty acid metabolism, and pharmaceutical drug metabolism, especially in localized tissues such as the skin and prostate.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, CYP4F8 does not have as prominent a role in drug metabolism as other CYP450 enzymes, but it does contribute to the metabolism of specific drugs, influencing their efficacy and toxicity on a personalized level, especially in tissues where it is highly expressed. Its activity can potentially alter leukotriene B4 levels, influencing anti-inflammatory drug responses. However, explicit drugs that are major substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of CYP4F8 are currently less well documented compared to other CYP enzymes. Research continues to uncover more about how variations in this gene affect drug metabolism and therapeutic outcomes in specific tissue contexts.
