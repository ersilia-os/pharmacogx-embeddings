## Gene Summary
MISP, also known as C19orf21 (chromosome 19 open reading frame 21), codes for the mitotic spindle positioning protein. MISP primarily functions in the regulation and organization of spindle orientation during mitotic cell division. It is crucial for accurate cell division and plays a role in maintaining the proper alignment and attachment of the mitotic spindle to the cell cortex. MISP is expressed in various tissues, but it is particularly significant in those with a high rate of cell division.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
MISP is implicated in the normal mitotic process, and disruptions in its function can lead to anomalies in cell division and orientation, contributing potentially to developmental disorders and cancer. It influences pathways associated with mitotic spindle assembly and positioning, interacting with key proteins like PLK1 and PAK1, which are known to be involved in cell cycle processes and tumor progression. Though not directly linked with specific genetic disorders, its fundamental role in mitosis suggests a latent association with cancerous growth where cell division becomes uncontrollable.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there is limited information on direct pharmacogenetic associations involving MISP with respect to specific drugs. Given its role in mitosis, drugs that target microtubule dynamics or cell cycle checkpoints may theoretically interact with MISP function, impacting drug efficacy and toxicity. However, specific interactions and effects need further clinical and genetic studies to define any significant pharmacogenetic implications. Thus, while MISP presents an intriguing target due to its essential function in cell division, more research is required to develop a robust pharmacogenetic profile.
