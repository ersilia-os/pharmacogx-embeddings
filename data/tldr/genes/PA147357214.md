## Gene Summary
TMEM165 (Transmembrane Protein 165) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the biology of the Golgi apparatus, particularly in glycosylation processes. The TMEM165 protein is localized in the Golgi membrane and is implicated in the homeostasis of ions like Ca2+ and Mn2+, critical for proper glycosylation. Dysfunctional TMEM165 affects glycosylation pathways and has been linked to a type of congenital disorders of glycosylation, highlighting its role in cellular processing and trafficking.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The dysfunction of TMEM165 has been primarily associated with Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG), specifically a subtype known as TMEM165-CDG (formerly CDG-IIk). These disorders present clinical features such as developmental delay, skeletal abnormalities, and other systemic complications, stemming from deficient glycosylation of proteins. The gene is part of critical cellular pathways managing the ionic environment within the Golgi apparatus, essential for the proper function of glycosylation enzymes. This has implications not just in developmental biology but also in understanding diseases linked to glycosylation errors.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic associations of TMEM165 are not well-documented with respect to direct interactions with specific drugs. The primary research focus remains on understanding the gene's role in disease pathology rather than drug response or resistance. However, knowledge of TMEM165-related disorders could potentially inform therapeutic strategies, particularly in managing symptoms or correcting glycosylation deficiencies in affected individuals. In terms of therapeutic interventions, more studies are necessary to explore if modulation of TMEM165 function or compensating for its dysfunction can be targeted pharmacologically. This could involve the use of chaperones or other agents that might help in restoring or enhancing the glycosylation process in patients with TMEM165-CDG.
