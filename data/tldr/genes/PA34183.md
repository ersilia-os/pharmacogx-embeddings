## Gene Summary
RAF1, also known as Raf-1 proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase, plays a critical role in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. It acts within the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, which is pivotal for processes like cell division, differentiation, and secretion. RAF1 is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in the adrenal gland, kidney, and brain. The protein encoded by this gene is involved in transmitting signals within cells and is essential for the regulation of growth and development. Mutations in RAF1 have been associated with Noonan syndrome and LEOPARD Syndrome, both of which affect multiple systems throughout the body.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The involvement of RAF1 in the MAPK/ERK pathway makes it significant in various types of cancer, including melanoma, colorectal cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. This gene's activation plays a role in cellular pathways controlling proliferation and survival, which can lead to oncogenesis if misregulated. RAF1's function in cardiac hypertrophy and hyperplasia also ties it to cardiovascular disorders. The gene's mutations have been implicated in developmental disorders such as Noonan syndrome and LEOPARD Syndrome, characterized by distinctive facial features, heart defects, developmental delays, and other phenotypic abnormalities.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of RAF1 is particularly relevant in the context of targeted cancer therapies. RAF1 is a target for kinase inhibitors used in treating cancers with aberrant MAPK pathway activity. Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor used primarily in renal and hepatocellular carcinomas, targets several kinases including RAF1. The effectiveness and toxicity of such drugs can be influenced by variations in the RAF1 gene, impacting patient outcomes. In clinical settings, testing for RAF1 mutations can guide the use of RAF inhibitors, adapting treatment plans to individual genetic profiles to enhance efficacy and reduce adverse effects. Understanding RAF1 interactions with drugs helps in developing personalized medicine strategies, particularly in oncology.
