## Gene Summary
The official symbol for the gene in question is PGR, which stands for Progesterone Receptor. PGR is a nuclear hormone receptor and transcription factor that is activated by the steroid hormone progesterone. It is primarily involved in the regulation of gene expression and affects cellular proliferation and differentiation in target tissues. The protein encoded by this gene has two main forms via alternative splicing, PRA and PRB, which differ in their influence and roles within different tissues. PGR is predominantly expressed in the reproductive tissues like the uterus, mammary gland, and ovarian stroma, and plays a critical role in the reproductive system, particularly in maintaining pregnancy and menstrual cycle regulation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
PGR is significant in its contribution to various reproductive conditions, most notably endometriosis, uterine fibroids, breast cancer, and other hormone-related disorders. The role of progesterone and its receptor in cancer, especially in breast and endometrial cancers, is well-established, influencing both disease progression and therapeutic strategies. PGR is involved in multiple signaling pathways, including the steroid hormone receptor signaling pathway, which influences cell cycle modulation, apoptosis, and cellular growth response. Dysfunction or alterations in the expression of PGR have been associated with a range of phenotypical impacts such as infertility, irregular menstrual cycles, and increased risk for certain types of cancers.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of PGR primarily revolves around its influence on the efficacy and safety of hormonal therapies used in various diseases, especially in oncology and gynecology. Notably, in breast cancer treatment, the status of PGR (together with ER - estrogen receptor) is crucial in determining the suitability and expected efficacy of endocrine therapy options like tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors. PGR status is routinely assessed in clinical oncology to tailor therapy plans for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients. For disorders like endometriosis and menstrual irregularities, synthetic progestins and other progesterone-related treatments are modulated based on PGR interactions. The geneâ€™s polymorphisms can influence the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of these drugs, affecting drug response variability among individuals.
