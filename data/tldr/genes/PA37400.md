## Gene Summary
XBP1, or X-box binding protein 1, plays a crucial role in the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, which is activated in response to stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The gene is involved in regulating the transcription of genes that maintain ER function, protein folding, and degradation machinery. XBP1 is also significant in the development and functioning of several types of cells in the immune system, particularly plasma cells. It exists in two isoforms, resulting from a splicing event; an unspliced form (XBP1u) and a spliced form (XBP1s), which acts as a transcription factor enhancing ER stress response elements.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
XBP1 is implicated in multiple pathways including protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum and response to ER stress. It is noteworthy in the context of diseases such as multiple myeloma, where XBP1s is essential for the growth and survival of the plasma cells. XBP1 dysfunction is linked with broader implications in oncogenesis, inflammatory diseases and more subtly in metabolic disorders like diabetes and lipid metabolism. Due to its role in ER stress, it potentially intersects with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease, although direct connections may require further investigation.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, XBP1 has gained attention mainly in the context of treatment responsiveness in multiple myeloma. The transcriptional activity of XBP1s makes it a pivotal element in the survival of plasma cells, and thus influences the effectiveness of proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib, which are commonly used in multiple myeloma treatment. Studies have demonstrated that the level of XBP1 splicing can affect the sensitivity of myeloma cells to these drugs, suggesting that XBP1 splicing status could potentially serve as a biomarker for proteasome inhibitor responsiveness. Furthermore, as ER stress modulators, small molecule inhibitors targeting the XBP1 pathway are considered prospective therapeutic strategies in diseases related to protein misfolding.
