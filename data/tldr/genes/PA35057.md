## Gene Summary
HLA-C, or Human Leukocyte Antigen C, is part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules encoded on chromosome 6. HLA-C plays a critical role in the immune system by presenting peptides derived from intracellular proteins to cytotoxic T cells. This presentation mechanism is fundamental for immune detection and response to infected or transformed cells. HLA-C is highly polymorphic, which influences its peptide binding preference and consequently impacts immune recognition. The expression of HLA-C is ubiquitous but relatively lower and more variable on different tissues compared to other MHC class I molecules.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
HLA-C is implicated in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases and immune-related conditions, such as psoriasis, HIV infection control, and transplant rejection. Its variations influence the susceptibility to and prognosis of these conditions due to differences in immune response efficacy. For example, certain alleles like HLA-C*06 are strongly associated with psoriasis. HLA-C interactions are also critical in cancer immunosurveillance. Pathway involvement includes antigen processing and presentation, a key pathway in adaptive immunity, where HLA-C participates in presenting endogenously synthesized antigens to CD8+ T cells.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, HLA-C has notable associations with drug hypersensitivity reactions. The allele HLA-C*06:02, for instance, is linked to adverse drug reactions with the antiviral agent abacavir used in HIV treatment. Patients carrying this allele have a significantly increased risk of developing abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome, which can be life-threatening. Therefore, genetic testing for HLA-C*06:02 is recommended before initiating abacavir treatment. Other drugs may also interact with different HLA-C variants affecting drug efficacy and toxicity, thus highlighting the importance of considering HLA-C alleles in precision medicine and individualized drug therapy planning.
