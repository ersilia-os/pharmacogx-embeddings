## Gene Summary
SLCO1B1, officially known as Solute Carrier Organic Anion Transporter Family Member 1B1, is crucial in hepatic uptake of various endogenous and xenobiotic compounds, including bile acids, hormones, and drugs. The protein encoded by SLCO1B1 is an organic anion-transporting polypeptide, part of the larger solute carrier family. This transporter is predominantly expressed in the liver and plays a significant role in the hepatic clearance of drugs from the blood. Variations within this gene have been linked to alterations in drug pharmacokinetics and treatment outcomes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SLCO1B1 is implicated in multiple clinical scenarios due to its role in drug transport. Its function affects the disposition and efficacy of a wide range of drugs including statins, antivirals, and cancer chemotherapeutics. Polymorphisms in this gene are associated with several disease phenotypes, notably statin-induced myopathy and differences in drug metabolism leading to adverse drug reactions or altered therapeutic effects. The transporter is involved in numerous physiological and pharmacological pathways, with a key role in drug detoxification processes, impacting both pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic relevance of SLCO1B1 is significant, particularly concerning the metabolism of statins such as simvastatin. Variants like the c.521T>C (also known as p.Val174Ala) polymorphism have been extensively studied for their impact on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, where this particular genetic alteration leads to a reduced transport function, increasing plasma concentration of the drug and risk of myopathy. Additionally, this gene affects the effectiveness and toxicity of other important drugs like atorvastatin, repaglinide, and rifampin. Patients carrying specific SLCO1B1 genotypes may require dose adjustments or alternative therapies to mitigate risks of adverse effects or therapeutic failures.
