## Gene Summary
BDKRB1, or Bradykinin Receptor B1, encodes a receptor for bradykinin, which is a peptide involved in inflammation and pain signaling. BDKRB1 is generally expressed at low levels under normal circumstances, but its expression is upregulated in response to tissue injury, inflammation, and certain cytokines. This receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), which activates various intracellular signaling pathways once bound by bradykinin, primarily those associated with the release of nitric oxide and prostaglandins, thereby contributing to the inflammatory response and vasodilation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
BDKRB1 is implicated in numerous inflammatory responses and related conditions such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and other pain-related phenomena. The receptor has been studied for its role in vasodilation, pain perception, and edema. Activation of BDKRB1 pathways is suggested to play roles in the progression of various inflammatory diseases, potentially making it a target for therapeutic interventions. The pathways linked to this gene include the Inflammatory mediator regulation of Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels and signaling by GPCR.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, BDKRB1 is essential as it may influence the response to drugs that act on the inflammatory and pain pathways. Although there are no major drug associations currently established exclusively with BDKRB1, understanding its role and genetic variations can potentially guide the therapeutic use of bradykinin receptor antagonists and other related anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs. Research in this area could pave the way towards personalized medicine approaches in treatment regimes for inflammation and pain management, especially in conditions where BDKRB1 expression is significantly altered.
