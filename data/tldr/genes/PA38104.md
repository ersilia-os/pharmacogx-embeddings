## Gene Summary
WNT5B (Wnt Family Member 5B) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the Wnt family, a group of signal transduction proteins that play critical roles in regulating embryonic development and maintaining homeostasis in adult tissues. These proteins function through the canonical beta-catenin-dependent pathway and non-canonical beta-catenin-independent pathways, modulating cell fate and behavior. WNT5B is specifically involved in the non-canonical signaling pathways, influencing processes like cell migration and polarity. The gene shows expression in multiple tissues, most notably in the lungs and placenta, suggesting its importance in organ development and function.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
WNT5B has been investigated for its involvement in several physiological and pathological conditions. Dysregulation of WNT5B expression has been implicated in diverse diseases such as obesity, cancer, and disorders of bone metabolism. In cancer, for example, altered WNT5B signaling is thought to contribute to the progression and metastasis of tumors. The gene is also associated with metabolic pathways that regulate adipogenesis, thus linking it to obesity and metabolic syndromes. The pathogenic influence of WNT5B arises primarily due to its role in controlling developmental processes and signaling cascades essential for cell differentiation and migration.

## Pharmacogenetics
Current pharmacogenetic insights related to WNT5B primarily focus on its potential role in influencing the effectiveness and toxicity of drugs targeting Wnt pathways, although specific drug interactions and implications are still under extensive research. Given the geneâ€™s involvement in signaling pathways essential for cellular proliferation and migration, drugs modulating Wnt signaling could potentially be affected by variations in WNT5B expression or function. However, as of now, clear pharmacogenetic associations involving specific medications and WNT5B have yet to be definitively established in clinical pharmacogenomics. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate how genetic variations in WNT5B could be harnessed to tailor therapeutic strategies, particularly in oncology and metabolic disorders.
