## Gene Summary
**ARG1** encodes arginase 1, a liver cytosolic enzyme that plays a crucial role in the urea cycle, which is essential for the detoxification and elimination of ammonia and nitrogenous wastes in mammals. ARG1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of arginine to ornithine and urea, representing one of the final steps in the cycle. Expression of ARG1 is primarily hepatic, but it is also found in red blood cells and other tissues. The enzyme's activity is critical for maintaining the balance of nitrogen and its deficit leads to argininemia, a disorder characterized by elevated levels of arginine in the blood.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ARG1 deficiency is directly linked to the disease argininemia, which can cause severe effects such as progressive neurological impairment, episodic hyperammonemia, and growth retardation. The ARG1 enzyme is part of the larger urea cycle, which is crucial for the removal of excess nitrogen produced during amino acid metabolism. In terms of phenotype, mutations in the ARG1 gene commonly result in high levels of arginine and ammonia in the blood, along with other symptoms associated with urea cycle disorders. This gene is also studied for its role in conditions outside of the liver, particularly its involvement in immune regulation and tumor metabolism, suggesting alternative pathways that ARG1 might influence.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, ARG1 is notable mainly in the context of managing argininemia and investigating its role in tumor resistance to immune therapy. No specific drugs target ARG1 directly; however, management of argininemia often involves dietary adjustments and nitrogen-scavenging drugs to manage ammonia levels. Beyond its role in metabolic disease, ARG1 expression is being explored in oncology, as it has been implicated in the suppression of anti-tumor immune responses, promoting tumor growth. The drugs modulating the arginine metabolism or indirectly affecting ARG1 activity could therefore potentially be useful in enhancing cancer immunotherapies. These findings highlight the relevance of ARG1 not only in genetic and metabolic disorders but also in broader contexts like oncology.
