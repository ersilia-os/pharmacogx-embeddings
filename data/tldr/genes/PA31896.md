## Gene Summary
OCRL, which stands for "Oculocerebrorenal Syndrome Of Lowe," encodes an inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase. This enzyme is involved in phosphatidylinositol signaling pathways, particularly acting on phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) at the 5-position of the inositol ring, resulting in its conversion to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P). The OCRL protein is vital in various cellular processes, including membrane trafficking, signaling, and cytokinesis. It is predominantly expressed in the kidney, brain, and eyes, areas that correspond to the symptoms observed in diseases associated with mutations in this gene.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in OCRL are primarily associated with Oculocerebrorenal Syndrome of Lowe, a rare X-linked disorder characterized by major symptoms including congenital cataracts, cognitive impairments, and renal tubular dysfunction. The gene is also linked to Dent disease, a milder renal disorder with some overlapping features such as kidney stones and renal failure. Pathway involvement of OCRL includes its crucial role in endocytosis and actin cytoskeleton organization, phosphoinositide metabolism, and in the regulation of cellular responses to growth factors.

## Pharmacogenetics
Given that OCRL is directly linked to specific genetic disorders like Lowe Syndrome and Dent disease, pharmacogenetic applications are mainly centered on therapeutic strategies that can potentially bypass or mitigate the effects of loss-of-function mutations in this enzyme. Currently, no direct drug interactions are known to be influenced specifically by variants in OCRL. Research is ongoing into understanding how modulation of phosphoinositide pathways can influence treatment strategies for the associated diseases. The study of OCRL pharmacogenetics is more focused on supportive and symptomatic care rather than targeted drug therapy due to the nature of the disorders it involves.
