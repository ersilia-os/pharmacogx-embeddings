## Gene Summary
INSR, short for Insulin Receptor, is a crucial gene involved in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. The encoded protein is a receptor tyrosine kinase belonging to the insulin receptor superfamily and is integral in the insulin signaling pathways. INSR mediates the pleiotropic actions of insulin in regulating carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. Upon insulin binding, the receptor undergoes autophosphorylation and activates a cascade of downstream proteins including PI3K and AKT, leading to glucose uptake into cells. The INSR gene is expressed in various tissues but predominantly in tissues that are key targets of insulin action such as liver, muscle, and adipose tissue.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
INSR is directly implicated in several metabolic disorders, primarily type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as severe insulin resistance syndromes such as Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome and Donohue syndrome. These conditions typically arise from mutations leading to INSR dysfunction, which disrupts normal glucose and lipid metabolism, often resulting in hyperglycemia and associated complications. The gene's influence extends over pathways involved in glucose uptake, including the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which is crucial for metabolic processes and has implications in diseases beyond diabetes, such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of INSR is particularly relevant in the context of insulin therapies and potentially in treatments involving insulin sensitizers like metformin and thiazolidinediones. Variations in INSR can influence the efficacy and safety of insulin and other drugs used in the management of diabetes. For example, specific polymorphisms in the INSR gene have been linked to differential responses to insulin, indicating a need for personalized treatment approaches based on genetic makeup. Understanding these associations is vital for optimizing therapeutic strategies for diabetes and related metabolic disorders, aiming to improve patient outcomes by tailoring treatments to genetic profiles.
