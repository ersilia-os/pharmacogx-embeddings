## Gene Summary
SLC28A1, short for Solute Carrier Family 28 Member 1, encodes a sodium/nucleoside cotransporter predominantly expressed in liver, heart, and skeletal muscle tissues. This protein plays a critical role in the cellular uptake of nucleosides, which are basic building blocks for the synthesis of nucleic acids. SLC28A1 specifically facilitates the active transport of purine and pyrimidine analogs across cell membranes, utilizing a sodium gradient as its driving force for nucleoside uptake.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The SLC28A1 gene is implicated in influencing cellular uptake of various pharmacologically active nucleoside derivatives used in antiviral and anticancer therapies. The pathways associated with SLC28A1 include nucleoside metabolic processes and purine metabolism. The altered function or expression of this transporter can potentially affect the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity profiles of nucleoside drugs. Although there are no direct associations currently reported with specific diseases, variations in SLC28A1 expression and function could potentially influence disease progression where altered nucleoside metabolism is a factor.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, SLC28A1 is significant for its role in modulating the efficacy and toxicity of several antiviral drugs such as ribavirin and zidovudine. These agents are used in the treatment of conditions like Hepatitis C and HIV/AIDS, respectively. Variations in the SLC28A1 gene might influence the transporter's efficiency, directly impacting drug absorption, plasma concentrations, cellular uptake, and consequently, clinical outcomes. Thus, genetic polymorphisms in SLC28A1 could serve as biomarkers for predicting patient response to nucleoside analog therapies, optimizing dosing regimens and minimizing adverse effects in personalized treatment plans.
