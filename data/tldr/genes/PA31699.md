## Gene Summary
NPC1L1, or Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1, is a critical gene involved in cholesterol absorption. It encodes a protein expressed predominantly in the small intestine and liver, playing a pivotal role in the absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol from the intestinal lumen into enterocytes. NPC1L1 is characterized by its function as a cholesterol transporter; its inhibition directly correlates with a reduction in plasma cholesterol levels.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NPC1L1 is central to the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis, influencing both cellular and systemic cholesterol levels. It is closely linked to disorders of lipid metabolism such as hypercholesterolemia and contributes indirectly to atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Phenotypically, alterations in NPC1L1 function can lead to varying cholesterol levels, impacting cardiovascular disease risk. The primary pathway associated with NPC1L1 involves the enterohepatic circulation of cholesterol, key to maintaining lipid homeostasis. Key drugs targeting this pathway include ezetimibe, which specifically inhibits NPC1L1 to reduce intestinal absorption of cholesterol.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, NPC1L1's most notable association is with the efficacy and response to ezetimibe, a cholesterol-lowering drug. Variants in the NPC1L1 gene can influence the therapeutic outcomes of ezetimibe treatment. For example, certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NPC1L1 have been linked to differences in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) response among individuals treated with ezetimibe, either alone or in combination with statins. This has pivotal implications in personalized medicine, guiding clinicians in tailoring cholesterol management strategies based on genetic profiles to optimize treatment efficacy and reduce cardiovascular risk.
