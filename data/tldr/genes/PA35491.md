## Gene Summary
STMN1, short for Stathmin 1, is a protein-coding gene that plays a critical role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. As a key player in cell cycle progression and differentiation, STMN1 is involved in the destabilization of microtubules, thus controlling the process of mitosis and cell division. The protein encoded by STMN1 is also known as oncoprotein 18 (Op18) due to its role in tumor development and progression. This gene's expression is notably higher in many types of cancer cells compared to normal tissues, linking it strongly with oncogenic processes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
STMN1 is implicated in several pathways and diseases, predominantly associated with cancer. The gene's overexpression has been noted in a variety of cancers, including leukemia, breast cancer, and lung cancer, suggesting its role in tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. In terms of cellular pathways, STMN1 is crucial for the proper regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis. The protein affects the G2/M transition of the cell cycle and contributes to cell motility and invasion capabilities of cancer cells. By influencing microtubule dynamics, STMN1 indirectly plays a role in the effectiveness of microtubule-targeting anticancer drugs.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetics research involving STMN1 primarily focuses on how its expression level and genetic variations affect the efficacy and toxicity of anti-cancer drugs, particularly those that target microtubules, such as paclitaxel and vincristine. High levels of STMN1 expression have been correlated with resistance to these microtubule-stabilizing agents, suggesting a potential utility for STMN1 as a biomarker for treatment response. Moreover, studies suggest that modulating STMN1 expression or activity could enhance the effectiveness of microtubule-targeting therapies, laying the groundwork for possible therapeutic interventions that could overcome drug resistance related to the action of STMN1.
