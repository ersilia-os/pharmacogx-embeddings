## Gene Summary
FZD3 (Frizzled Class Receptor 3) is a gene encoding a member of the frizzled receptor family, which belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. FZD3 receptors are involved in the transduction of Wnt signaling, a pathway crucial for embryonic development, cell differentiation, and morphogenesis. The protein encoded by FZD3 is particularly implicated in the development of the nervous system, including axon guidance and neurogenesis. FZD3 expression is widespread but shows higher activity in neuronal tissues.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
FZD3 influences several pathways, most notably the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, playing a key role in processes such as cell fate determination and patterning during development. Disruption in FZD3 function has been associated with the susceptibility to neurodevelopmental disorders. Studies link FZD3 variants to schizophrenia and other psychiatric conditions, suggesting its involvement in brain development and function. Furthermore, FZD3 may have implications in cancer biology, particularly in types where Wnt signaling is known to be deregulated, although direct associations are less documented compared to other frizzled family members.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics aspects of FZD3 are not well-established compared to genes more directly associated with drug metabolism or response. However, the involvement of FZD3 in crucial signaling pathways suggests potential future relevance in therapeutic contexts, particularly in drugs targeting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Developments in this field might lead to targeted therapies, especially for conditions like cancer and neurological disorders linked to this pathway. Currently, no specific drugs targeting FZD3 are in clinical use, but understanding its role may inform the pharmacogenetics of Wnt pathway modulators.
