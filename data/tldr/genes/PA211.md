## Gene Summary
KCNE1, also known as potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E regulatory subunit 1, is a gene that encodes a protein essential for the proper function of the cardiac muscle. The product of KCNE1 is a potassium channel ancillary subunit, which regulates potassium ion permeability and kinetics by altering the properties of ion flow through the channel. This gene is predominantly expressed in the heart, particularly in the myocardial tissue, and plays a vital role in controlling the cardiac action potential and thus the heart rhythm.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations and variations in KCNE1 have been associated with several cardiac disorders, primarily Long QT Syndrome 5 (LQT5) and familial atrial fibrillation. The alteration in the function of the potassium channels due to mutated KCNE1 can lead to abnormal repolarization, which is crucial in the pathophysiology of arrhythmias. KCNE1 is important for the IKs channel function, a slow, delayed rectifier K+ current that contributes to the phase 3 of the cardiac action potential. The gene is involved in the cardiac action potential regulation pathway and has a significant implication in arrhythmogenesis through its effect on cardiac electrophysiology.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, the KCNE1 gene is critical due to its role in modifying the cardiac response to various drugs, particularly in the context of arrhythmias. Certain variants in KCNE1 can influence the cardiac response to drugs like antiarrhythmics (e.g., sotalol) and other medications that can prolong the QT interval. For instance, patients with certain KCNE1 mutations may exhibit increased susceptibility to drug-induced Long QT syndrome, a condition that can lead to torsade de pointes and sudden death. Pharmacogenetic testing can help in predicting drug response and tailoring medications to reduce the risk of adverse cardiac events in individuals with KCNE1 variants.
