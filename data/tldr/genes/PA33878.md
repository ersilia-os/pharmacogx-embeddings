## Gene Summary
PSMA4, which stands for "proteasome subunit alpha 4," is a component of the proteasome, a critical complex responsible for protein degradation involved in various cellular processes including the cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair. The encoded protein forms a part of the 20S core of the proteasome, where it has a role in degrading ubiquitinated proteins. PSMA4 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, highlighting its fundamental role in maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
PSMA4 is implicated in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, crucial for protein homeostasis. Alterations in this pathway can contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and inflammatory conditions. The proteasome is a target in cancer therapy, with inhibitors such as bortezomib and carfilzomib designed to disrupt cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting proteasome activity. Studies suggest a role for PSMA4 in modulating immune responses and possibly influencing disease states via its proteasomal degradation pathways.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, PSMA4 has been less studied directly for drug interactions compared to other proteasome subunits. However, given its role in the proteasome, variations in PSMA4 may impact the efficacy and toxicity of proteasome inhibitors. Bortezomib, used primarily for treating multiple myeloma, might have varying effectiveness depending on the functional status of the proteasome complex influenced by PSMA4. Thus, investigating polymorphisms or expression levels of PSMA4 could potentially guide tailored therapeutic strategies using proteasome inhibitors. Further research is needed to establish clear pharmacogenetic profiles linking PSMA4 variants to specific drug responses.
