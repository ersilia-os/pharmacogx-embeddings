## Gene Summary
ATP7B is the official symbol for the ATPase Copper Transporting Beta gene, which is crucial for copper transport within cells. It expresses a membrane-bound transporter protein that belongs to the P-type ATPase family, pivotal for maintaining intracellular copper levels. ATP7B actively transports copper ions from the cytosol into the trans-Golgi network for incorporation into copper-dependent enzymes and facilitates copper excretion into bile. The gene is predominantly expressed in the liver but also found in the kidney, placenta, and brain. Mutations in ATP7B lead to defective copper transport and accumulation, primarily affecting hepatic systems.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ATP7B plays a significant role in disorders related to copper metabolism, most notably Wilson disease, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by excessive deposition of copper in tissues, leading to hepatic and neurological symptoms. The gene influences several copper-dependent enzymes, such as ceruloplasmin, crucial for iron metabolism. Pathways associated with ATP7B include copper ion transmembrane transport and bile acid biosynthesis, emphasizing its role in liver function and systemic copper homeostasis. Research indicates implications in other copper-related neurological and hepatic conditions beyond Wilson disease, reflecting its broad physiological relevance.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, ATP7B is particularly relevant in the treatment and management of Wilson disease. Drugs commonly used include chelators such as D-penicillamine and trientine, which bind to copper and enhance its excretion, and zinc salts, which block the absorption of copper in the gut. The effectiveness of these treatments can vary widely among individuals due to differences in ATP7B mutations affecting the protein's function. Genetic testing of ATP7B can guide the choice and dosage of these therapies to optimize clinical outcomes, highlighting the importance of pharmacogenetic insights in managing copper-related disorders.
