## Gene Summary
CXCR2, or C-X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 2, is a gene located on human chromosome 2q35. It encodes for a protein of the same name that functions as a receptor for chemokines with a CXC motif. These chemokines, in particular, bind to CXCR2 and induce various cellular responses vital for immune function, including the directed migration of white blood cells towards sites of inflammation. CXCR2 is thus predominantly expressed in neutrophils but is also present in other cells involved in the inflammatory response such as monocytes and macrophages. This receptor plays a critical role in mediating neutrophil activation and migration to inflammation sites.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The CXCR2 receptor is notably involved in the pathology of various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases due to its role in leukocyte chemotaxis. It has been implicated in conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Activation of CXCR2 also contributes to the pathogenesis of cancer by supporting tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis especially in lung and breast cancers. Therapeutically, CXCR2 has been targeted by specific inhibitors aimed at controlling excessive inflammatory responses. This receptor is explored in the pathways including the chemokine signaling pathway, which is fundamental for immune cell trafficking and inflammatory responses.

## Pharmacogenetics
CXCR2's relevance in pharmacogenetics primarily revolves around its influence on the efficacy and reaction to drugs targeting inflammation and cancer growth. Specific responsive behaviors to inhibitors like reparixin, which is used in inflammatory conditions and cancer, could be potentiated through CXCR2 pathways. The polymorphisms in the CXCR2 gene might influence the pharmacodynamics of such drugs, altering how effectively these medications can bind and inhibit the receptor, thereby impacting drug efficacy and patient response. Thus, genetic variations in CXCR2 could serve as crucial determinants for personalized medicine strategies in treating inflammation-driven diseases and various cancers. Understanding these genetic variations aids in optimizing therapeutic approaches and managing potential adverse effects more effectively.
