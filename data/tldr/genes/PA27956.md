## Gene Summary
**FABP1**, also known as liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), is a gene that encodes the fatty acid-binding protein 1 which is expressed predominantly in the liver. It plays a critical role in the intracellular transport of long-chain fatty acids and their acyl-CoA derivatives. FABP1 is also involved in the binding and transport of other small hydrophobic substances such as bilirubin and drugs. Its expression can vary under different physiological and pathological conditions, affecting lipid metabolism and cell signaling pathways.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
FABP1 is implicated in several metabolic processes and pathways including fatty acid metabolism, PPAR signaling, and the regulation of lipid storage. Alterations in its function or expression have been linked to liver diseases, metabolic syndrome, and other conditions associated with abnormal lipid metabolism. Research has noted potential implications of FABP1 in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), diabetes, and obesity.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic associations of FABP1 primarily relate to its influence on the metabolism of various drugs, including those used to manage lipid levels and other metabolic conditions. Modifier effects of genetic variants in FABP1 might influence an individual's response to specific drugs by affecting drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Thereâ€™s a particular interest in examining how these variants could influence responses to treatments in disorders like hyperlipidemia, though specific widely recognized drugs modulated by FABP1 variants are not well delineated. As such, ongoing research is crucial to clarify these interactions and optimize therapeutic approaches based on genetic backgrounds.
