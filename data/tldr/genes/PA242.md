## Gene Summary
NR3C2, also known as the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), is a nuclear receptor gene that encodes a protein primarily involved in the regulation of electrolyte and water balance through its role in controlling sodium retention and potassium excretion in the kidneys. The protein functions as a ligand-dependent transcription factor and mediates the physiological effects of aldosterone and other mineralocorticoids. The expression of NR3C2 is notably high in the kidneys, specifically in renal distal tubule cells, but it is also present in other tissues, including the heart, brain, and colon.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NR3C2 is integral to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), a hormone system that regulates blood pressure and fluid balance. Mutations in this gene can lead to conditions such as autosomal dominant pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1), characterized by salt wasting and failure to thrive. This gene is also involved in several cardiovascular diseases and has a role in the physiological response to stress and the regulation of inflammation. NR3C2 influences various signaling pathways linked to ion transport, cardiovascular function, and stress response.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of NR3C2 mainly concerns its relationship with the effectiveness and metabolism of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) like spironolactone, eplerenone, and canrenone. These drugs are used in the treatment of conditions such as hypertension, heart failure, and conditions associated with excessive aldosterone production like Conn's syndrome. Variations in the NR3C2 gene can influence a person's response to these medications, affecting both therapeutic efficacy and the risk of side effects. Specifically, certain polymorphisms in NR3C2 have been associated with differential blood pressure responses to MRAs, suggesting the potential for personalized treatment strategies in hypertension and cardiovascular disorders based on NR3C2 genotypes. This highlights the importance of NR3C2 in precision medicine and its potential to guide the choice and dosage of MRAs in clinical settings.
