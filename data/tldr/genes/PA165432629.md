## Gene Summary
RPTOR, also known as the regulatory associated protein of mTOR complex 1 (Raptor), plays a crucial role in cellular growth and metabolism. It is an essential component of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which functions as a nutrient/energy/redox sensor and controls protein synthesis. The activity of this complex is instrumental in many cellular processes including autophagy, lysosome function, and apoptosis. RPTOR achieves this by helping to recruit substrates to the mTORC1 complex, which is a critical driver of cell growth in response to nutrients, growth factors, and other stimuli.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
RPTOR is fundamentally linked to several key biological pathways including the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and it directly interacts with mechanisms governing cell cycle control and energy homeostasis. Disruptions or alterations in RPTOR function and expression have been noted in contexts of metabolic disorders, obesity, diabetes, and certain types of cancers like breast and prostate cancer. It affects cellular processes that are pivotal in cancer biology such as growth, proliferation, and survival, thus making it a potential target for cancer therapy.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, RPTOR is mainly significant due to its role in the mechanism of action of drugs targeting the mTOR pathway, such as the well-known anticancer drug rapamycin (also known as sirolimus) and its analogs (rapalogs). These drugs bind to the FKBP12 protein, forming a complex that inhibits the mTORC1 complex, consequently causing a reduction in protein synthesis and cell proliferation. This action is particularly critical in cancer therapy, targeting tumor cell growth and survival. Studies involving variations in RPTOR could potentially influence the response to these therapies, indicating a need for personalized treatment strategies based on genetic makeup. Further understanding of RPTOR genetics could enhance the efficacy and safety profiles of mTOR inhibitors and aid in the development of novel therapeutics that harness this pathway.
