## Gene Summary
GSTO1, or Glutathione S-Transferase Omega 1, is a member of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family, which plays a crucial role in cellular detoxification. The enzymes in this family catalyze the conjugation of glutathione to a wide variety of endogenous and exogenous electrophilic compounds. This process is essential for the metabolizing and excretion of toxins and carcinogens. GSTO1 is distinct in its ability to bind to heavy metals and may also be involved in the metabolism of lipid oxidation products. The expression of GSTO1 is widespread but with variable levels across different tissues, notably including liver, kidney, and brain.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
GSTO1 has been implicated in several diseases and biologic processes, fundamentally due to its role in oxidative stress and detoxification. Conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and various cardiovascular diseases have shown associations with GSTO1 activity. The gene is also involved in significant metabolic and regulatory pathways, including those related to drug metabolism - cytochrome P450 and glutathione metabolism pathways. GSTO1's ability to metabolize arsenic compounds indicates its relevance in toxicology and pharmacology, especially concerning arsenic exposure.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of GSTO1 primarily focuses on how variations in this gene affect individual responses to drugs and susceptibility to toxicity. The gene may modulate responses to certain chemotherapy agents due to its overarching role in detoxification and metabolism. For example, variants in GSTO1 have been investigated for their influence on the effectiveness and side effects of drugs like cisplatin and carboplatin, common chemotherapeutic agents. These drugs are known to induce oxidative stress, implicating GSTO1 in the handling of drug-induced reactive oxygen species. Moreover, the gene's involvement in modulating arsenic pharmacokinetics suggests a pharmacogenetic angle in the treatment of arsenic poisoning, potentially impacting the efficacy and safety of detoxifying agents used in such treatments.
