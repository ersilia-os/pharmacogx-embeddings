## Gene Summary
NRG1 (neuregulin 1) is a gene that encodes a member of the neuregulin family of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like ligands, which are involved in a variety of cellular processes including growth and development. The protein produced by NRG1 is crucial for the development of the nervous system and the heart. It acts by binding to the ErbB family of receptors, specifically ErbB3 and ErbB4, initiating intracellular signaling cascades. This gene exhibits diverse splicing which leads to multiple isoforms, each having distinct functions, allowing for its diverse role which includes neural development, heart development and the regulation of cell growth.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NRG1 is implicated in several pathways, including those governing cardiac formation, maintenance of neural structures, and cell signaling. Disruptions or alterations in its expression or function have been associated with several diseases such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and various types of cancer, particularly breast cancer. Neuregulins, including NRG1, also play a significant role in the nervous system by influencing synaptic plasticity, which impacts learning and memory processes. Their role in both the central and peripheral nervous systems underscores their importance in maintaining neuronal function and integrity.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of NRG1 primarily concerns its association with the treatment of psychiatric disorders and cancer. In schizophrenia, variations in the NRG1 gene might alter the effectiveness or the risk profile of antipsychotic drugs although specific agents directly influenced by NRG1 variations are yet to be definitively identified. In cancer therapy, particularly breast cancer, the Neuregulin-ErbB pathway is a significant target. Drug interactions with this pathway can influence the efficacy of ErbB receptor inhibitors such as trastuzumab, an antibody used in the treatment of breast cancer. Moreover, ongoing studies are exploring the efficacy of neuregulin peptides and their receptor modulators, which could further expand the relevance of NRG1 in pharmacogenetics.
