## Gene Summary
CARD16, also known as Cardinal 16, is a member of the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) family of proteins, which are known to play integral roles in apoptosis and inflammation signaling pathways. CARD16 functions specifically as an inhibitor in these pathways, acting to modulate the activity of certain caspases and thereby impacting cell death and inflammatory responses. This gene is primarily expressed in human tissues known for their role in immune responses.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CARD16 is substantially involved in pathways relating to inflammation and immune system responses. Malfunctions or variations in its expression or function can be linked to inflammatory diseases, although specific diseases directly associated with CARD16 have not been robustly characterized in the available literature. This gene's role as a modulator of caspase activity places it within a broader context of apoptotic regulation, which is crucial in many disease processes including cancer and autoimmune disorders.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of CARD16 has not been as extensively documented as some other genes more directly targeted by specific drugs. Due to its role in regulating inflammation and apoptosis, variations in CARD16 could potentially influence the efficacy or safety of drugs used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases or cancer. However, no direct associations with specific drugs have been strongly established as of the current knowledge, leaving an area open for further investigation in how CARD16 might affect drug response in clinical practice.
