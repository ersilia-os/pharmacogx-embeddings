## Gene Summary
FCN2, short for 'ficolin (collagen/fibrinogen domain containing lectin) 2', is a gene that encodes for a protein belonging to the ficolin family of proteins, which are characterized by collagen-like and fibrinogen-like domains. These proteins are involved in the innate immune system as part of the lectin pathway of complement activation, which contributes to the first line of defense against pathogens. FCN2 specifically binds to certain sugar molecules on the surface of pathogens and apoptotic cells, which can activate the complement system and enhance phagocytosis. FCN2 is primarily expressed in the liver, and its protein product circulates in the blood.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The FCN2 protein is crucial in modulating immune response mechanisms, particularly in recognizing and clearing pathogens. Dysregulation or variations in this protein have been associated with susceptibility to several infectious diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis, and respiratory tract infections. Genetically, variants of the FCN2 gene have been studied concerning their roles in immune competence and disease susceptibility. In terms of biological pathways, FCN2 is a key component in the lectin pathway activation of complement system, mediating both immune cell recruitment and direct killing of pathogens.

## Pharmacogenetics
Research on the pharmacogenetics of FCN2 is less extensive compared to genes directly involved with drug metabolism or transport. However, given the gene's role in immune system modulation, genetic differences in FCN2 might influence the effectiveness or adverse effects of drugs that target immune components or rely on immune system competence. Notably, understanding variations in the FCN2 gene could impact the clinical management of infectious diseases and guide the use of immunomodulatory therapies. Clinical studies might, in future, explore the impact of FCN2 polymorphisms on the pharmacodynamics of certain vaccines or immune-targeted therapies, although currently, no specific drug interactions with FCN2 have been thoroughly established.
