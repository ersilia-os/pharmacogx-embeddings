## Gene Summary
HNRNPH2 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H2) is a gene that encodes a member of the HNRNP family, which is involved in RNA processing and mRNA metabolism. HNRNPH2 is a part of the hnRNP group of proteins that have a key role in the splicing of pre-mRNA and the biogenesis of mRNA. The protein encoded by this gene contains four repeats of an RNP-1 (ribonucleoprotein 1) motif, which are important for RNA binding. HNRNPH2 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues but shows higher expression levels in certain regions of the brain.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
HNRNPH2 has been associated mainly with neurodevelopmental disorders and intellectual disability. Mutations or alterations in this gene are particularly linked to disorders such as intellectual developmental disorder with or without epilepsy or cerebellar ataxia and other related phenotypes. The gene's influence extends to RNA processing pathways, and its dysregulation can lead to defects in mRNA splicing, potentially resulting in aberrant protein production, leading to disease.

## Pharmacogenetics
As of the current knowledge, HNRNPH2 has not been prominently associated with pharmacogenetics in terms of direct interactions with specific drugs or influence on drug metabolism. The gene's primary significance in medicine pertains to its role in congenital disorders affecting neural development. However, understanding the molecular mechanics of HNRNPH2 might inform future therapeutic strategies or interventions for treating the associated neurodevelopmental disorders.
