## Gene Summary
SLC28A3, or Solute Carrier Family 28 Member 3, is part of the solute carrier family, specifically involved in the sodium-coupled nucleoside transport. This gene encodes a protein known as a concentrative nucleoside transporter, which predominantly facilitates the cellular uptake of nucleosides and nucleoside analogs, along with sodium ions, primarily in the liver and kidney. The expressed transporter exhibits specificity mainly towards purine nucleosides, pyrimidine nucleosides, and their analogs, playing a crucial role in the salvaging and metabolism of nucleosides.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The function of SLC28A3 is significant in contexts where nucleoside analogs are used, such as antiviral and anticancer therapies. Its activity affects the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of drugs like ribavirin, which is used against hepatitis C and certain viral hemorrhagic fevers. Additionally, alterations in the expression or function of this transporter can influence drug toxicity and resistance. The gene is also relevant in understanding conditions associated with disrupted nucleoside metabolism and transport, such as certain types of renal diseases.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of SLC28A3 is critical particularly in the administration of ribavirin and other nucleoside analogs. Variations in the SLC28A3 gene can lead to differences in drug absorption and clearance, impacting drug efficacy and the risk of adverse effects. For instance, certain polymorphisms in SLC28A3 have been investigated for their role in modulating ribavirin treatment outcomes in hepatitis C patients, affecting therapy responses and the manifestation of anemia as a side effect. This highlights the importance of considering SLC28A3 genotypes in personalized medicine, particularly in treatments involving nucleoside analogs.
