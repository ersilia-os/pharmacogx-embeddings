## Gene Summary
CD58, also known as Lymphocyte Function-associated Antigen 3 (LFA-3), is a gene that encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface glycoprotein involved in the processes of cell adhesion and immune response. The protein binds to CD2 (LFA-2) on T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells, facilitating intercellular communication crucial for the immune response. CD58 is extensively expressed in different body tissues but predominantly found on the surface of antigen-presenting cells, endothelial cells, and hematopoietic cells. This gene plays a vital role in enhancing cellular immune reactions by promoting T-cell activation and NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CD58 is implicated in a number of autoimmune diseases and conditions involving immune dysfunction, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In multiple sclerosis, the interaction between CD58 on brain tissue and CD2 on immune cells is thought to influence the inflammatory response which damages the myelin sheath. Also, studies have shown that variations in the CD58 gene are associated with susceptibility to these autoimmune conditions, highlighting its role in disease pathology. Pathway analysis reveals that CD58 is heavily involved in the immune system pathways, particularly those regulating the activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes and NK cells. Additionally, CD58-mediated signaling is crucial for strengthening synapse formation between T cells and antigen-presenting cells during an immune response.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of CD58 involves its role in modulating the efficacy and therapeutic response of treatments in immune-related diseases. Although direct associations with specific drugs are less documented, understanding genetic variations in CD58 contributes to personalized treatment approaches in diseases like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. For instance, treatments that target T-cell activation could be influenced by the expression and function of CD58, as it is a critical co-stimulatory molecule in immune cell interactions. Therefore, genetic studies that identify variants of the CD58 gene could help predict patient responses to immunomodulatory therapies or the development of biologic agents that specifically enhance or inhibit CD58-CD2 interactions, thereby modulating the immune response in a controlled manner. This makes the gene a candidate for further pharmacogenetic research, which could lead to more effective, tailored therapies for autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.
