## Gene Summary
GNMT, or glycine N-methyltransferase, is a critical gene involved in the regulation of methionine and homocysteine levels in the liver. It encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the methylation of glycine using S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) as the methyl donor, resulting in the product S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). GNMT plays a pivotal role in maintaining the balance of methyl group transfer and is key in preventing the accumulation of excess methionine and toxic derivatives. This enzyme is predominantly expressed in the liver and pancreas, influencing various metabolic pathways.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The function of GNMT is crucial in pathways involving methionine metabolism and methyl group transfer, with implications in the one-carbon metabolism pathway. Dysregulation or mutations in GNMT have been associated with several metabolic disorders. Notably, it has been linked to diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma due to its role in detoxification and liver function. Alterations in GNMT expression or function can lead to abnormal methylation patterns and metabolic profiles, influencing disease states and susceptibility.

## Pharmacogenetics
While GNMT is not directly targeted by specific drugs, its role in methionine metabolism makes it indirectly influential in the action and efficacy of agents affecting or relying on methylation processes. For instance, its interactions with SAMe are of interest since SAMe is used as a supplement for liver health and as an antidepressant. Variability in the GNMT gene can potentially alter SAMe levels, thus affecting its therapeutic impacts. There is also ongoing research into how GNMT's activity could modulate responses to other drugs through its effect on liver metabolism and general health, suggesting a broader, though currently less defined, pharmacogenetic role.
