## Gene Summary
ADCY9 (Adenylate Cyclase 9) is a gene that encodes a member of the adenylate cyclase family, which plays a crucial role in catalyzing the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP) and pyrophosphate. cAMP acts as a second messenger involved in the activation of protein kinases and regulates various physiological processes including metabolism, memory, and cardiac function. ADCY9 is predominantly expressed in the brain and heart, showing the significant role it potentially plays in neurological and cardiovascular systems.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The activity of ADCY9 is linked with several key pathways including cAMP signaling pathway and downstream signaling cascades related to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are pivotal in transmitting various cellular responses to hormones and other external stimuli. Due to its involvement in these fundamental pathways, abnormalities in the expression or function of ADCY9 are associated with various diseases including mood disorders and potentially impacts cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure. Its modulation has also been implicated in influencing adiposity and energy balance, indicating a possible linkage to metabolic syndromes.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic studies have investigated the relationship between ADCY9 polymorphisms and response to therapies in cardiovascular diseases. Notably, genetic variation in ADCY9 has been studied in the context of response to antiplatelet therapy, particularly concerning the effectiveness of the P2Y12 inhibitor ticagrelor used in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes. Research suggests that individuals with certain ADCY9 genotypes may exhibit different responses to this drug, which can influence clinical decisions on the choice of antiplatelet therapy. While specific drugs targeting ADCY9 directly are not well-known, the geneâ€™s product, influenced by its genetic variations, plays a significant role in mediating the efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions targeting pathways in which ADCY9 is involved.
