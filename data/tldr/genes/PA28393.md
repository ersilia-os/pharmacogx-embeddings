## Gene Summary
ALDH1L1, or Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family Member L1, is a gene that encodes an enzyme of the folate-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase family. It primarily participates in carbon metabolism, specifically in the folate pathway where it catalyzes the irreversible conversion of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and CO2. ALDH1L1 is highly expressed in the liver and kidney, and plays a critical role in regulating folate metabolism. The expression of ALDH1L1 has also been identified as a marker for astrocytes in the central nervous system, indicating its importance outside of metabolic functions.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ALDH1L1 has been implicated in a variety of metabolic regimes and pathways, mainly centered on folate metabolism which is crucial for DNA synthesis and repair. Dysregulation of this gene and the folate pathways in which it participates can potentially contribute to diseases such as neural tube defects and other congenital deformities associated with folate metabolism dysfunction. Additionally, as a marker for astrocytes, ALDH1L1 is studied in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, where changes in astrocyte function and neuroinflammation are often observed. The gene's role in cell cycle regulation and migration is also of interest in cancer studies, particularly in glioblastoma.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic role of ALDH1L1 is less prominent as direct associations between this gene and specific drugs are not well-documented or widely studied. However, any modulation of folate metabolism by drugs, such as antifolates used in chemotherapy (e.g., methotrexate), could theoretically be influenced by the function or expression of ALDH1L1. For example, individuals with variations in the ALDH1L1 gene might exhibit different responses to treatments affecting folate levels. Understanding the genetic variations of ALDH1L1 could contribute to more personalized treatment strategies where folate modulation is crucial, particularly in the context of cancer treatment and prevention of chemotherapy-induced toxicity. However, specific pharmacogenetic relationships involving ALDH1L1 remain an area requiring further research and investigation.
