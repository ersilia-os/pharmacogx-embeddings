## Gene Summary
OPRL1, or opioid related nociceptin receptor 1, is a gene that encodes the nociceptin receptor, also known as the NOP receptor. This receptor is a member of the opioid receptor family and is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system. It binds the endogenous neuropeptide nociceptin, also referred to as orphanin FQ, and is involved in a wide range of biological functions, including pain modulation, stress response, and anxiety. The OPRL1 receptor differs from other opioid receptors in that it does not bind classical opioid peptides like endorphins, but it is sensitive to its unique ligand, nociceptin.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The activation of the OPRL1 receptor by nociceptin influences numerous physiological processes and has been implicated in various pathophysiological states. The primary role of OPRL1 is in pain perception and management; hence, it is a potential target for developing new analgesics. Additionally, studies suggest roles in mood regulation, suggesting potential therapeutic implications for mood disorders. The OPRL1 pathway involves the modulation of intracellular cAMP and various ion channels which mediate its effects on neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release. There is also increasing evidence linking OPRL1 to the regulation of immune functions and feeding behavior.

## Pharmacogenetics
OPRL1's involvement in pain and anxiety pathways makes it a compelling candidate for pharmacogenetic studies focusing on individual responses to pain medications and potential treatments for mood disorders. Currently, selective NOP receptor agonists and antagonists are being examined for their therapeutic potential, and variations in the OPRL1 gene could influence individual responses to these drugs. For instance, AT-121 is a novel bifunctional nociceptin and mu-opioid receptor agonist showing promise in non-human primate models for pain management and addiction treatment without typical opioid-induced side effects. Understanding genetic variations in OPRL1 could help in tailoring these emerging therapies to enhance efficacy and safety for individual patients, though more detailed human studies are needed to establish robust pharmacogenetic correlations.
