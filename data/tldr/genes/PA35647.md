## Gene Summary
SEMA3C, or Semaphorin 3C, is a gene that encodes a member of the semaphorin III family of secreted signaling molecules. SEMA3C is primarily involved in the regulation of axonal guidance in the nervous system, influencing the growth of axons and the formation of neural connections. It also plays a role in the development of various organs, including the heart and lungs, by mediating angiogenesis and other developmental processes. SEMA3C functions by binding to neuropilin and plexin receptors, initiating signaling cascades that control cellular migration and positioning.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SEMA3C is implicated in several developmental and disease pathways. These include its role in cardiovascular development and associated anomalies, such as congenital heart defects. Disorders in SEMA3C expression or function have also been linked to cancer progression, particularly in facilitating tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. The gene is involved in the semaphorin signaling pathway, which affects nerve and vascular patterning. There is research suggesting its involvement in developmental syndromes characterized by neural and cardiac defects.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of SEMA3C is not as extensively documented as for some other genes, particularly those directly linked to drug metabolism. However, understanding SEMA3C's function in angiogenesis and cancer progression suggests potential implications in treatments that target these pathways. For instance, its role in tumor growth and metastasis may make SEMA3C a target for cancer therapeutic strategies aimed at inhibiting semaphorin-mediated pathways. Although no specific drugs targeting SEMA3C are currently well-established, ongoing research into its pharmacological manipulation, particularly in oncology, may reveal significant associations in the future.
