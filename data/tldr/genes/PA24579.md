## Gene Summary
ADK, or Adenosine Kinase, is an enzyme predominantly involved in cellular energy and nucleotide metabolism. Expressing ubiquitously in mammalian tissues, it is vital for the phosphorylation of adenosine, a nucleoside, converting it to adenosine monophosphate (AMP). ADK acts as a key regulator in preserving the adenosine balance, which is crucial for managing energy metabolism, neurotransmission, and cellular responses to stress signaling. High ADK expression is mainly observed in the liver and brain, particularly influencing neurological activities and developmental processes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The ADK gene has been explored for its implications in various neurological diseases due to its regulatory role in neurotransmitter systems. Disorders like epilepsy have been associated with variations in adenosine metabolism, potentially linked to altered ADK activity. Furthermore, overactivity of ADK in the brain is hypothesized in contributing to conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The gene's product, adenosine kinase, links to the purine metabolism and adenosine signaling pathways, essential for maintaining cellular energetics and homeostasis. Changes in these pathways can influence disease phenotypes and may be targets for therapeutic interventions.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, alterations in the ADK gene may impact the effectiveness and toxicity of drugs that rely on purinergic mechanisms. Although specific pharmacogenetic associations of ADK with drugs remain relatively under-researched compared to genes directly involved in drug metabolism pathways, its role in neurotransmission suggests a potential influence on the therapeutic outcomes of neuropsychiatric medications. For example, drugs that modulate adenosine levels indirectly affect ADK activity, potentially altering drug efficacy and safety profiles. Understanding genetic variations in ADK could enhance the development of tailored therapies in neurological disorders, aiming to optimize adenosine modulation.
