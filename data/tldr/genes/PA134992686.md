## Gene Summary
YEATS4, also known as Gas41, is a gene that encodes the YEATS domain-containing protein 4. This transcriptional enhancer activator is primarily involved in the regulation of gene expression. YEATS4 is part of chromatin modification complexes and interacts with transcriptional activation and elongation machinery. Expression of YEATS4 is ubiquitously found across various tissues but is notably high in rapidly dividing cells, suggesting its important role in cell cycle regulation and cellular proliferation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
YEATS4 has been implicated in several oncological conditions. Its overexpression has been observed in multiple types of cancers, including glioblastoma, lung cancer, and acute leukemia, indicating a potential role in tumorigenesis. This gene is involved in the regulation of apoptosis and cell cycle progression, pathways critical for cancer development and progression. Due to its involvement in these pathways, YEATS4 may influence tumor growth and response to therapy. Furthermore, its role in chromatin modification hints at broader implications in epigenetic regulation which can affect various biological processes and diseases.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, research concerning YEATS4 is still emerging. Given its association with several cancers, YEATS4 could become a target for therapeutic interventions, particularly in oncology. Drugs targeting pathways associated with chromatin modification and apoptosis could potentially be affected by variations in the YEATS4 gene. However, specific pharmacogenetic associations involving direct interactions between YEATS4 and drugs have not been extensively documented yet. Continued research may illuminate specific gene-drug interactions and help in the development of personalized therapeutic strategies, especially in cancer treatment.
