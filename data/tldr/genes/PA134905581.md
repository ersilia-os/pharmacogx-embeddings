## Gene Summary
NCOA7, or Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 7, is involved in the regulation of gene expression. It acts as a coactivator for estrogen receptors and possibly other nuclear receptors. This gene is important for various cellular processes, including regulation of metabolism, cell proliferation, and development. NCOA7 is widely expressed in human tissues, with notable expression in organs such as the brain, lung, and liver. The gene potentially plays a role in modulating the transcriptional activity by interacting with other proteins and serving as a bridge to the general transcription machinery.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NCOA7 has been studied in the context of its role in various diseases but is particularly noted for its involvement in ovarian cancer and neurological disorders. The modulation of estrogen receptor activity by NCOA7 suggests a potential role in hormone-related cancers. In terms of cellular pathways, this gene is involved in estrogen signaling and possibly other pathways mediated by nuclear receptors. The expression levels and function of NCOA7 are crucial in maintaining normal cellular function and disruptions can lead to phenotypic alterations potentially linked to disease states.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics related to NCOA7 is still under exploration. Given its role as a coactivator for estrogen receptors, it is conceivable that variations in NCOA7 could influence the efficacy and safety of drugs that act through these and potentially other nuclear receptors. However, as of the last update, there are no specific drugs known to have a pharmacogenetic association exclusively linked through NCOA7. Future research may establish more concrete associations, particularly in the context of therapies for estrogen receptor-positive cancers and possibly in treatments involving modulation of nuclear receptors.
