## Gene Summary
IL2RA, also known as the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain, is a gene that encodes a protein which is part of the IL-2 receptor complex. This complex plays a pivotal role in the immune response by regulating the activities of white blood cells known as lymphocytes, which are essential for the immune system's response to infections and malignancies. IL2RA is predominantly expressed in the immune system, particularly in T lymphocytes. It is essential for the high-affinity binding of interleukin-2 (IL-2), a cytokine that promotes the growth and differentiation of T cells. The IL2RA gene itself can be induced in low-affinity situations but requires the presence of other chains (β and γ) to form a high-affinity site.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The IL2RA gene is associated with multiple immunologically related disorders. Notably, genetic variations and expression levels of IL2RA have been linked to autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes. Its expression is also relevant in the context of allograft rejection in transplant medicine, where its modulation might alter immune tolerance. The IL2RA protein is targeted in clinical strategies using drugs like basiliximab and daclizumab, which are monoclonal antibodies used to prevent acute rejection in transplant patients by blocking IL-2-mediated T-cell activation. Pathway-wise, IL2RA is significant in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway and has implications in the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, which transduces many cytokine-mediated signals.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, IL2RA’s relevance primarily emerges through its involvement in the modulation of immune responses via IL-2. The antibodies targeting IL2RA, such as basiliximab and daclizumab, are used to mitigate excessive immune reactions in transplant patients. By blocking the interaction between IL-2 and its receptor, these drugs help prevent the body from rejecting transplanted organs. Variability in the expression or function of IL2RA could potentially influence the efficacy and safety profile of these treatments, thus impacting dosing regimens or therapeutic effectiveness. Additionally, because autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes have been linked to variants in the IL2RA gene, there is interest in understanding how these variations might influence the outcomes of treatments that modulate the immune system through mechanisms involving IL-2 and its receptor.
