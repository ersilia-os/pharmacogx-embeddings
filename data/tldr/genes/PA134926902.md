## Gene Summary
CYP2D7, or Cytochrome P450 Family 2 Subfamily D Member 7, is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of a wide variety of substrates, including drugs, xenobiotics, and endogenous compounds. CYP2D7 is a pseudogene in humans, meaning that it does not produce a functional enzyme due to the presence of inactivating mutations or insertions/deletions within its sequence. This gene is located on chromosome 22, near the functional gene CYP2D6, which is highly polymorphic and plays a critical role in drug metabolism. Despite being a pseudogene, CYP2D7 shares high sequence homology with CYP2D6, suggesting an evolutionary relationship.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Given that CYP2D7 is a pseudogene, it is not directly involved in the metabolism of drugs or associated directly with diseases. Its closest relative, CYP2D6, however, is extensively studied for its role in metabolizing approximately 25% of clinically used drugs. CYP2D7 does not code for an active enzyme and thus does not participate in metabolic pathways directly affecting pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The analysis or study of CYP2D7 primarily provides insights into the evolutionary aspects and gene duplication events related to the CYP2D family, especially in relation to CYP2D6.

## Pharmacogenetics
CYP2D7 does not have active pharmacogenetic implications because it is a pseudogene and does not produce a functional protein. Therefore, it is not involved in the metabolism of pharmaceutical substances, nor is it linked to variance in drug response commonly assessed in pharmacogenetics studies. Research in the area of CYP2D7 often focuses on its genomic context and relationship to CYP2D6, helping to understand the complex genetic basis for the high variability observed in CYP2D6 activity among different individuals or populations. This contextual information can contribute indirectly to understanding pharmacogenetic implications of the CYP2D family overall, particularly in genetic structuring and the potential for misannotation in genetic tests.
