## Gene Summary
SLCO1C1, or Solute Carrier Organic Anion Transporter Family Member 1C1, is a gene that encodes a member of the organic anion transporter (OAT) family. This family of transmembrane proteins facilitates the transport of a broad range of drugs, metabolites, and endogenous substrates across cell membranes. SLCO1C1 specifically impacts the transport of thyroid hormones and potentially other substrates, playing a crucial role in their distribution and metabolism. The expression of SLCO1C1 is predominantly observed in the blood-brain barrier, particularly in endothelial cells surrounding the brain, suggesting an essential function in regulating thyroid hormone access to the central nervous system.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SLCO1C1 is directly associated with the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of thyroid hormones, mainly thyroxine (T4), which influences various physiological processes such as metabolism, growth, and development. Dysregulation or genetic variations in SLCO1C1 can potentially impact thyroid hormone levels, implicating the gene in related disorders such as hypothyroidism, although direct associations with specific diseases require further investigation. The geneâ€™s role in transporting thyroid hormones places it within critical endocrine and neurological pathways, potentially influencing several phenotypic outcomes related to cognitive function and neurological health.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of SLCO1C1 involve its influence on the transport and efficacy of thyroid hormones, particularly in the context of drug interactions that may affect thyroid hormone levels. While specific drugs that directly interact with SLCO1C1 are not well-characterized, substances that alter thyroid hormone levels could hypothetically affect the function of this transporter. Additionally, genetic polymorphisms in SLCO1C1 may alter its transporter activity, potentially modifying the therapeutic effects of drugs that are substrates of other related transporters, or affecting thyroid hormone therapy in diseases like hypothyroidism. Understanding these interactions is crucial for optimizing therapeutic strategies that involve the modulation of thyroid hormone levels.
