## Gene Summary
SPECC1L, also known as Sperm Antigen With Calponin Homology And Coiled-Coil Domains 1 Like, is a gene involved in the morphogenesis of various structures within the organism, particularly craniofacial development. It encodes a cytoskeletal protein that plays a critical role in maintaining cell shape and structure. SPECC1L is known to be involved in cytoskeletal organization and cell-cell adhesion, influencing epithelial cell polarization and migration. Expression of SPECC1L is vital during embryonic development, and mutations in this gene are linked to defects in craniofacial and other organ formations.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in SPECC1L have been associated with several congenital disorders, most notably oblique facial clefts and Tessier number 7 clefts. The geneâ€™s role in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal arrangement implicates it in the developmental pathways important for proper facial morphogenesis. The disruption in SPECC1L expression can lead to syndromic forms of craniofacial anomalies, which are severe enough to affect vital functions such as breathing and feeding. Research also indicates a broader implication in potentially influencing epithelial tumors, although direct connections are still under investigation.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there are no direct pharmacogenetic associations involving SPECC1L concerning specific drug responses or treatments. This gene is primarily studied in the context of developmental biology and genetics rather than pharmacotherapy. Future research might reveal potential targets within the pathways affected by SPECC1L for therapeutic interventions, particularly in the field of regenerative medicine or gene therapy aimed at correcting congenital defects. Understanding the gene's precise mechanism and interaction with other molecular pathways could provide insights that are relevant for developing new therapeutic strategies.
