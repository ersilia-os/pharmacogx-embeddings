## Gene Summary
KCNMB2 is the official symbol for the gene encoding the potassium calcium-activated channel subfamily M regulatory beta subunit 2. It primarily functions as a regulatory subunit of large conductance, voltage, and calcium-sensitive potassium channels (BK channels), enhancing channel activity in response to changes in intracellular calcium. KCNMB2 plays a critical role in modulating the electrical excitability of neurons and smooth muscle cells, impacting a broad range of physiological processes. Expression of KCNMB2 is notably found in the brain and cardiovascular system.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
KCNMB2 is implicated in influencing the functioning of cardiovascular and neural systems, potentially linking it to conditions like hypertension, epilepsy, and other neurological disorders. Phenotypes associated with variations in this gene may include alterations in smooth muscle tension and neuronal excitability, influencing both vascular tone and neurotransmission. Pathways involving KCNMB2 largely center around its role in potassium signaling that affects cellular excitability and muscle contraction.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the realm of pharmacogenetics, KCNMB2â€™s significance emerges from its modulation of BK channels which are crucial therapeutic targets in disorders like hypertension and stroke. Even though specific widely used drugs targeting KCNMB2 directly are not well-detailed, its influence on the efficacy of drugs that target related ion channels, particularly in the context of cardiovascular and neurological pharmacotherapy, is under investigation. Research into KCNMB2 could further elucidate its potential as a pharmacogenetic target, aiding in the development of more precisely tailored treatments that cater to individual genetic profiles.
