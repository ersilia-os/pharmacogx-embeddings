## Gene Summary
GSK3B (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 Beta) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in numerous cellular processes including metabolism, cell cycle regulation, and gene expression. GSK3B is expressed in a variety of tissues, with significant presence in the brain. This enzyme regulates various signaling pathways, notably the Wnt and insulin signaling pathways. It is involved in the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase, inhibiting glycogen synthesis, and also impacts cellular processes by phosphorylating other substrates including microtubule-associated proteins and transcription factors.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
GSK3B is involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases due to its role in key signaling pathways influencing cell growth, survival, and development. Notably, it has been implicated in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, by influencing tau hyperphosphorylation, which is a hallmark of the disease. GSK3B is also linked with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia through its effects on neural and synaptic functionalities. It influences pathways such as the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, crucial for cell survival and growth, and Wnt signaling, critical for developmental processes and diseases like cancer.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of GSK3B is significant due to its modulation by various drugs, primarily in the context of neurological disorders and cancer. Lithium, used prominently in the treatment of bipolar disorder, inhibits GSK3B activity, which is thought to contribute to its therapeutic effects by stabilizing mood through neurotransmitter pathways and neuroprotective effects. Research suggests this inhibition plays a crucial role in lithium's efficacy, particularly in mood stabilization. In cancer therapy, inhibitors targeting GSK3B are being explored due to the kinase's role in cell proliferation and survival pathways. Understanding individual genetic variations in GSK3B can potentially aid in tailoring treatments involving these inhibitors, enhancing efficacy and reducing adverse effects. This highlights the importance of considering GSK3B in the pharmacogenetic context, particularly in treatment approaches for both psychiatric and oncological diseases.
