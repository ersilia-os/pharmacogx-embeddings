## Gene Summary
**LTA** (lymphotoxin alpha), formerly known as TNF-beta (Tumor Necrosis Factor-beta), is a cytokine that belongs to the TNF superfamily. This gene is crucial in the regulation of immune responses and plays a significant role in inflammation and immune system development. LTA is primarily produced by lymphocytes and forms a crucial part of the lymphotoxin pathway, which impacts lymphoid tissue architecture and the development of secondary lymphoid organs. Expression of LTA can be induced under certain inflammatory conditions and it can function both as a soluble cytokine and as a membrane-bound protein.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
LTA is implicated in various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The gene's influence extends to the pathogenesis of several infectious diseases, highlighting its role in immune regulation and response. LTA interacts with receptors like TNFRSF1A to initiate signaling pathways that lead to NF-ÎºB activation, which is essential for immune response regulation and cell survival signals. It is also involved in the TNF signaling pathway and plays a role in apoptosis and cell proliferation.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of LTA primarily involves its association with the susceptibility and treatment responses in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Variations in the LTA gene, particularly in its promoter region, have been linked to differential responses to treatments in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and SLE. Specific allelic variants of LTA are associated with altered response to immunomodulatory drugs such as corticosteroids and TNF inhibitors. These genetic variations can influence treatment efficacy and the risk of adverse effects, making LTA a potential target for personalized medicine approaches in inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.
