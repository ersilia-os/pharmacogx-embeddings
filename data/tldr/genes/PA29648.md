## Gene Summary
IFIT1 (Interferon-Induced Protein With Tetratricopeptide Repeats 1) is a critical component of the interferon-mediated antiviral response. This gene is predominantly expressed in immune system-related tissues and is rapidly upregulated in response to interferon stimulation. IFIT1 functions by inhibiting viral replication and modulating host immune responses. It can specifically recognize viral RNA lacking 2'-O-methylation on the cap, a modification that differentiates host from viral messenger RNA. This recognition prevents the translation of viral proteins by hindering the assembly of the translation initiation complex.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
IFIT1 plays a significant role in the immune response to viral infections and potentially impacts diseases characterized by viral etiologies, such as influenza, hepatitis, and other viral hemorrhagic fevers. Moreover, it's implicated in broader immune response dysregulations such as those seen in autoimmune disorders. The activation of IFIT1 is aligned with pathways related to interferon signaling and antiviral mechanisms, specifically the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which is pivotal for transmitting the antiviral effects of interferons within the cell. There is ongoing investigation into the varying expression levels of IFIT1 in autoimmune diseases, suggesting it might influence disease phenotypes.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of IFIT1 are primarily related to its role in modulating immune response during antiviral and immunomodulatory therapies. Although direct associations between specific drugs and IFIT1 genetic variations are not extensively documented, understanding IFIT1's function can inform treatment choices for viral infections. For instance, patients with different expression levels or genetic variants of IFIT1 might exhibit variable responses to interferon therapies used in diseases like multiple sclerosis and chronic hepatitis. Further research is needed to elucidate specific pharmacogenetic associations that could inform personalized medical approaches based on IFIT1 genetic profiles.
