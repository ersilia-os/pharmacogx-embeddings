## Gene Summary
CFH, or complement factor H, is a regulator of the complement cascade, which is part of the immune system that enhances the ability to clear microbes and damaged cells from an organism, promotes inflammation, and attacks the pathogen's cell membrane. It is predominantly expressed in the liver and secreted into the plasma. The protein encoded by CFH regulates complement activation on self cells by possessing both cofactor activity for the inactivation of C3b and C4b by factor I and decay-accelerating activity against the C3/C5 convertases, C3bBb and C4b2a.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CFH is critically involved in the pathogenesis of several disorders, particularly those related to the complement system dysregulation. Diseases associated with CFH include Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS), and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II (dense deposit disease). Dysfunction or abnormal regulation of CFH can lead to uncontrolled complement activation, which causes damage to host cells and contributes to disease. Pathways associated with CFH primarily involve the alternative pathway of complement activation, which plays a crucial role in innate immunity and inflammation.

## Pharmacogenetics
CFH has meaningful pharmacogenetic implications, especially in conditions like AMD and aHUS, where the complement pathway plays a significant role. Genetic variants in CFH, particularly the Y402H polymorphism, have been associated with an increased risk of developing AMD. This association informs the potential therapeutic strategies involving complement inhibitors. For aHUS, drugs targeting complement components, such as Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to complement protein C5, are influenced by CFH activity. Understanding the CFH genotype can potentially guide dosage and treatment strategies, reducing the risk of excessive complement activation and improving clinical outcomes.
