## Gene Summary
CDCA3 (Cell Division Cycle Associated 3) is a gene involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, specifically at the mitotic phase. It is part of a larger group known as the cell division cycle associated proteins, which play crucial roles in controlling cell cycle transitions. CDCA3 is recognized for its function in the activation of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a critical event for the progression from metaphase to anaphase during mitosis. It is expressed in various tissues with higher expression levels typically seen in proliferating tissues due to its role in cell division.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CDCA3 has been associated with several cellular pathways predominantly related to its role in cell cycle regulation and mitosis. This gene interacts with components like SKP1 and CUL1, involved in the SCF complex, playing an essential role in ubiquitination and protein degradation necessary for cell cycle progression. While CDCA3 itself is not directly linked to specific drugs or disease phenotypes in common clinical settings, its dysregulation has been observed in various cancers, suggesting that it plays a role in tumor progression and malignancy. 

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic relevance of CDCA3 is relatively unexplored, with no direct associations between CDCA3 gene variations and drug response or susceptibility currently established in the standard clinical pharmacogenetic databases or literature. However, given its pivotal role in cell cycle regulation, there is potential for CDCA3 to be implicated in future studies focused on the effectiveness or toxicity of drugs that target cell division, particularly in oncology settings where regulation of mitosis is a common therapeutic target. Research into CDCA3 could reveal important insights into personalized treatment strategies for cancer based on the genetic makeup of a patient's CDCA3 gene or its expression levels.
