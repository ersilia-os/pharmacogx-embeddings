## Gene Summary
HTR1A is the official symbol for the serotonin receptor 1A, a key member of the G protein-coupled receptor family involved in various neuromodulatory processes. HTR1A regulates serotonin, an important neurotransmitter and hormone influencing mood, anxiety, and cognition. Primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and amygdala, HTR1A mediates inhibitory neurotransmission and plays a crucial role in stress response, thermoregulation, and circadian rhythms.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
HTR1A is associated with numerous psychiatric and neurological disorders, including depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Its connection to serotonin activity ties it to phenotypes related to mood and anxiety levels. The gene also has implications in pharmacology and neurophysiology research, particularly concerning mood regulation and emotional responsiveness. Pathways involving HTR1A include several neural signaling mechanisms and pharmacodynamic pathways for antidepressants and anxiolytics.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, the HTR1A gene is important for understanding individual differences in the responses to various psychotropic drugs. Genetic variations in HTR1A have been linked to differential responses to several antidepressants, such as citalopram and escitalopram, which are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These associations are particularly relevant in treating mood disorders, which may be influenced by an individual's specific HTR1A gene variants, affecting both drug efficacy and susceptibility to side effects. The gene's role in the serotonin system makes it a target for SSRIs and potentially for novel therapeutic agents in psychiatric conditions.
