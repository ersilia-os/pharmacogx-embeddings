## Gene Summary
NRG3 (Neuregulin 3) is a member of the neuregulin family, which plays a critical role in neural and cardiac development. NRG3 is closely related to other neuregulins: it interacts with the ERBB family of receptors, predominantly ERBB4, to elicit important cell signaling processes. NRG3 is primarily involved in the development and function of the nervous system, including roles in neural development, differentiation, and synaptic plasticity. The expression of NRG3 is primarily noted in the central nervous system but also occurs in other tissues, although at lower levels.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NRG3 has been implicated in several neural and psychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Research suggests a potential role in neural crest cell differentiation and may impact several cellular pathways related to cell communication and migration. While the pathways involving NRG3 include PI3K-Akt signaling and the regulation of various aspects of cellular metabolism and survival, its specific contributions to disease phenotypes are mediated largely through its interaction with the ERBB4 receptor and subsequent intracellular signaling cascades.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of NRG3 is an emerging field, primarily connected to its implications in psychiatric disorders. Although no direct drug associations are currently established in mainstream treatment regimes directly targeting NRG3, its role in modulating ERBB4 activity suggests potential indirect pharmacogenetic implications in drugs targeting the ERBB signaling pathways. These could pertain to innovative treatments for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder that might modify ERBB4 receptor interactions or function. Ongoing research is likely to further elucidate the pharmacogenetic relevance of NRG3, potentially leading to targeted therapies that address the specific mechanisms by which NRG3 influences disease.
