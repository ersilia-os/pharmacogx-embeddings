## Gene Summary
CDH4, also known as Cadherin 4 or R-cadherin, is a member of the cadherin superfamily. Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion glycoproteins, which play crucial roles in maintaining proper cell-cell boundary formations and tissue architecture. CDH4 is specifically involved in the organization of cells into tissues due to its adhesive properties. The expression of CDH4 is prevalent in the central nervous system and is pivotal during neural segmentation and development.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
While CDH4 has not been directly linked to specific drugs, its involvement in disease pathways is notable, particularly in relation to developmental and neurological disorders. Mutations and dysregulation of CDH4 have been implicated in contributing to developmental anomalies, particularly those affecting the brain and spinal cord. The gene also has a role in cancer biology, influencing tumor progression and metastasis in certain types of cancer through its effects on cell adhesion and migration. CDH4's primary involvement in pathways focuses on cell adhesion mechanisms, critical during embryonic neural development.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of CDH4 is not as extensively characterized as those of more prominent pharmacogenetic targets like CYP450 enzymes. However, understanding its genetic variants can be important in the context of developmental therapeutics, especially those targeting neural tissue repair and regeneration. No specific drug interactions have been deeply studied or documented primarily based on CDH4 variations, but research into the broader implications of cadherin function may, in the future, influence therapeutic interventions in both developmental disorders and cancer. Hence, ongoing research may uncover more direct relationships between CDH4 genetic variations and responses to certain therapies, particularly in personalized medicine for cancer or neuropsychiatric disorders.
