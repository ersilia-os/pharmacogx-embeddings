## Gene Summary
NFKB2 (Nuclear Factor Kappa B Subunit 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the NF-kappa-B complex, which is a pivotal transcription factor in inflammation, immunity, cell growth, and apoptosis. The NFKB2 protein is crucial for diverse biological processes including the immune response, overall homeostasis, and cellular communication. It is expressed in a variety of cell types and tissues, often being activated by various stimuli such as cytokines, free radicals, ultraviolet irradiation, and bacterial or viral antigens.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NFKB2 mutations and dysregulation are associated with several diseases, particularly those involving the immune system. This includes conditions such as common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), multiple myeloma, and certain forms of Hodgkin's lymphoma. Moreover, aberrant NF-kappa B signaling linked to NFKB2 is implicated in autoimmune disorders and inflammatory conditions. The NFKB pathway itself is essential for immune responses, inflammation processes, and plays a role in cancer progression and apoptosis resistance mechanisms. 

## Pharmacogenetics
From a pharmacogenetic perspective, NFKB2 stands out due to its central role in inflammatory and immune pathways which are targeted by various drug therapies. Drugs that modulate the NF-kappa B pathway, indirectly affecting NFKB2 activity include glucocorticoids, proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib used in multiple myeloma treatment), and IKK inhibitors. These interactions are significant in providing therapeutic strategies for diseases involving aberrant NF-kappa B signaling. The variation in response to these drugs may be influenced by individual genetic differences in the NFKB2 gene, thus highlighting its pharmacogenetic importance. Understanding these variations can lead to more personalized treatments in diseases like cancers and immune disorders.
