## Gene Summary
MMP1, also known as matrix metallopeptidase 1, encodes an enzyme belonging to the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family, involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in normal physiological processes such as embryonic development, reproduction, tissue remodeling, and disease processes, such as arthritis and metastasis. MMP1 is known for its ability to cleave collagen, the major component of the extracellular matrix. This gene is expressed in various tissues but is particularly prominent in connective tissues. MMP1 activity is regulated at several levels including transcription, proenzyme activation, and inhibition by endogenous inhibitors known as tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs).

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
MMP1 is implicated in numerous pathological conditions including cancer, arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, and fibrosis due to its role in collagen degradation and tissue remodeling. In cancer, MMP1 can facilitate tumor invasion and metastasis by degrading the extracellular matrix. Its expression is also involved in inflammatory pathways and has been linked to conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis where degradation of joint tissues occurs. MMP1 is a part of the signaling pathways that deal with cytokine and growth factor activities, influencing cell behavior relevant to inflammation and cancer progression.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic investigations into MMP1 often focus on its role in drug responses for diseases involving excessive extracellular matrix remodeling, such as cancer and fibrotic diseases. Specific genetic polymorphisms in the MMP1 gene promoter, like the 1G/2G polymorphism, have been studied to understand variations in gene expression and activity among individuals, which can influence the effectiveness and safety profiles of certain drugs targeting MMP pathways. Understanding these genetic variations helps in tailoring therapies involving MMP inhibitors, potentially enhancing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing adverse effects in diseases like cancer and fibrosis where MMP1 expression is a critical factor.
