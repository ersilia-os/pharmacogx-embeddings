## Gene Summary
KNG1, or Kininogen-1, is an essential component in the kallikrein-kinin system, primarily responsible for producing kinins, key peptides that are involved in blood pressure regulation, inflammation, and pain. KNG1 encodes for high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK), which acts as a substrate for the enzyme kallikrein. When HMWK is cleaved by kallikrein, it releases bradykinin, a potent vasodilator. The gene is expressed in the liver and circulates in the plasma as a multifunctional glycoprotein involved in several biological and pathological processes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
KNG1's involvement in the biochemical pathway of blood coagulation positions it as a critical player in managing blood clotting and vascular integrity. The protein interactions primarily include the prekallikrein to kallikrein conversion and subsequent bradykinin production, which significantly impacts vascular permeability and smooth muscle tone. Disturbances or deficiencies in KNG1 have been tentatively linked to increased risks of hypertension and other cardiovascular disorders. Moreover, abnormal levels of kininogens might contribute to inflammatory conditions, due to the role of bradykinin in inflammation.

## Pharmacogenetics
KNG1's pharmacogenetic significance primarily stems from its involvement with bradykinin production. Drugs that modulate the kallikrein-kinin system, such as ACE inhibitors - widely used in hypertension management - can indirectly influence KNG1 activity. Adverse drug reactions involving KNG1 include cases where ACE inhibitors cause angioedema, a rapid swelling of the skin and mucosa, presumptively linked to increased bradykinin levels due to reduced degradation. Understanding genetic variations in KNG1 could potentially help predict individual susceptibility to such conditions and guide more personalized treatment strategies in the use of ACE inhibitors and other related therapies.
