## Gene Summary
PPP2R5D is the official symbol for the gene "protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit B'delta". This gene encodes a regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) enzyme, which is one of the four major Ser/Thr phosphatases involved in the negative control of cell growth and division. PP2A is known to regulate various cellular processes such as signal transduction pathways, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. PPP2R5D is primarily expressed in tissues like the brain and heart, suggesting its importance in both neural and cardiac functions.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
PPP2R5D has been implicated in several key pathways including the regulation of cell growth, division, and apoptosis through interaction with major signaling pathways such as AKT/mTOR, Wnt, and MAPK/ERK. Mutations and alterations in the expression of this gene are associated with various disease states including cardiac anomalies and neurodevelopmental disorders. Specifically, variants in PPP2R5D have been linked to intellectual disability and developmental delays, often grouped under the umbrella of "PPP2R5D-related intellectual disability".

## Pharmacogenetics
At the present, pharmacogenetic data specifically associating PPP2R5D mutations with responses to pharmaceutical drugs are limited. However, given its role in multiple signaling pathways that are common drug targets (e.g., AKT/mTOR in cancer therapy), it's conceivable that future research could reveal relevant associations. Research into the pharmacogenetics of PPP2R5D might focus on how variations in this gene affect the efficacy and toxicity of drugs targeting pathways like mTOR inhibitors in cancer treatment or other conditions that involve dysregulated cell cycle and growth signaling.
