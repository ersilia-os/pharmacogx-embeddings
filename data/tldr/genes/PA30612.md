## Gene Summary
MAP4K4, also known as Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4, is a serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in various cellular processes. It plays a critical role in the regulation of apoptosis, cell proliferation, cytoskeleton reorganization, and immune response. MAP4K4 is widely expressed in human tissues, but with higher levels in the heart and skeletal muscle. Its activity is essential in mediating signal transduction for several major intracellular pathways, including those involved in stress and inflammatory responses.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
MAP4K4 is associated with several pathways including JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinases) activation, Toll-like receptor signaling, and TNF signaling pathway, which are crucial for immune responses and inflammation. Dysregulation of these pathways can contribute to various pathological conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes. The gene's implication in these pathways makes it a potential target for therapeutic intervention in diseases characterized by aberrant cell signaling such as cancer and inflammatory disorders.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of MAP4K4 are being explored in the context of its role in disease pathways, particularly in cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Although there are currently no direct pharmacogenetic associations involving specific drugs targeting MAP4K4, its central role in crucial signaling pathways makes it a potential indirect target for drugs aimed at modulating these pathways. Research into MAP4K4 inhibitors is ongoing in clinical trials, particularly in oncology settings to test their efficacy and safety, which may uncover significant pharmacogenetic interactions in the future. Drugs that target pathways influenced by MAP4K4 activity could potentially be affected by genetic variants of this kinase, affecting drug response and patient outcomes.
