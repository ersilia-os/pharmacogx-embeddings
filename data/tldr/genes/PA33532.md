## Gene Summary
POR, or Cytochrome P450 Oxidoreductase, is a critical enzyme in the metabolism of drugs and synthesis of steroids. It formally serves as an electron donor in the cytochrome P450 system, which includes over 50 enzymes responsible for the biotransformation of many substances, including endogenous markers and xenobiotics. POR is widely expressed in many tissues but predominantly in the liver and adrenal gland. This gene's product is an essential component in the P450-containing systems which metabolize drugs and help in cholesterol, steroids, and other lipids synthesis.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
POR interacts with various drugs through its role in drug metabolism, principally via its involvement in the function of multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes. It is implicated in several metabolic pathways including, but not limited to, drug metabolism, steroid biosynthesis, and cholesterol metabolism. Genetic mutations in POR have been associated with disorders such as Antley-Bixler syndrome, a congenital malformation syndrome, and disordered steroidogenesis manifesting as adrenal hyperplasia. These health issues underscore the gene's crucial role in normal physiological development and hormonal balances.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic research around POR is chiefly focused on how variations within this gene affect drug metabolism, which can lead to differences in drug efficacy and toxicity among individuals. POR mutations can alter the metabolic activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, affecting the metabolism of drugs such as statins, anticoagulants, and antiepileptics among others. For example, a specific variant of POR, *p.A287P*, has been noted to significantly decrease the metabolic activity of CYP3A4, influencing the metabolism of drugs like cyclophosphamide and the immunosuppressant tacrolimus. This makes POR a notable gene in the context of tailored pharmacotherapy, providing insights into personalized medicine approaches to optimize drug dosing and reduce adverse drug reactions.
