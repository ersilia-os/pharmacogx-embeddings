## Gene Summary
DSP, or Desmoplakin, is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for the proper function of desmosomes, which are specialized structures in cell membranes that mediate adhesion between cells, particularly in the epithelial and myocardial tissues. DSP is extensively involved in the linkage of the cytoskeleton to the cell membrane, playing a critical role in maintaining cell structure and tissue integrity. It is most abundantly expressed in tissues that experience intense mechanical stress such as the heart and skin.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations and dysregulation of DSP are primarily associated with a spectrum of disorders, mainly focusing on cardiocutaneous syndromes. It is a key gene involved in diseases such as arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C), which is characterized by the replacement of myocardial cells with fibrofatty tissue and can lead to heart failure and sudden cardiac death. DSP also plays a role in skin disorders such as keratoderma, which involves abnormal skin thickening. The protein encoded by DSP is part of the desmosomal pathway which includes interaction with other related proteins like plakoglobin and plakophilin, vital for cellular adhesion and integrity.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, most pharmacogenetics information related to DSP pertains to how its genetic variability can affect disease predisposition rather than direct associations with specific drugs. However, understanding the genetic variations within DSP is vital as it might influence the effectiveness of treatments aimed at managing ARVD/C and related cardiocutaneous syndromes. Based on the disease associations, therapies might involve the use of skin condition treatments and cardiac function support in a personalized manner. Nevertheless, concrete pharmacogenetic relationships involving direct drug interactions remain underexplored and could be a potential area for future research in targeting therapy to manage the dysfunctions arising from DSP mutations.
