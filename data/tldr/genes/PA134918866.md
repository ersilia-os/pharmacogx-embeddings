## Gene Summary
DOCK8, or Dedicator of cytokinesis 8, plays a critical role in the regulation of immune system functions. It is predominantly known for its involvement in the actin cytoskeleton organization, influencing both cell shape and movement. DOCK8 primarily impacts immune cell functionality, particularly in lymphocytes and dendritic cells, where it supports cellular processes such as migration and activation. It also has a notable role in signal transduction pathways that activate immune responses and influence cell survival.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
DOCK8 is deeply involved in the pathogenesis of several immunological disorders. Mutations in this gene are primarily linked to a rare condition known as DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome, which is characterized by recurrent viral infections, allergies, and an increased risk of malignancies. This syndrome is described as a combined immunodeficiency disorder affecting multiple aspects of the immune system, particularly the adaptive immune response. Pathways associated with DOCK8 include those related to actin cytoskeleton organization, and immune response signaling, highlighting its role in maintaining immune cell functions and overall immune surveillance.

## Pharmacogenetics
Research into the pharmacogenetics of DOCK8 is relatively limited, primarily focusing on its implications in the context of immune dysregulation rather than direct associations with specific drugs. However, treatments targeting the symptoms or complications of DOCK8 deficiency, such as infections and immune dysregulation, might be influenced by genetic variations in DOCK8. Immunomodulatory therapies, including those for managing viral infections or correcting immune deficiencies, could potentially be affected by the genetic status of DOCK8. No specific drugs have been directly linked as yet in pharmacogenetics studies focusing solely on DOCK8. Further research could unveil potential pharmacogenetic effects impacting the effectiveness or safety of treatments in individuals with DOCK8 mutations.
