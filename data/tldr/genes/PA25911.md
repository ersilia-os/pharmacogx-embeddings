## Gene Summary
C5, also known as Complement Component 5, is a gene in humans that encodes the protein complement component 5, a part of the complement system, which is critical for immune response and inflammation. This protein is involved in the cleavage to C5a, an anaphylatoxin that plays a role in enhancing inflammatory responses, and C5b, which forms part of the membrane attack complex that can cause lysis of pathogens or damaged cells. C5 is primarily produced in the liver and is expressed in many tissues throughout the body, modulating not only immune functions but also potentially influencing neurodegenerative and autoimmune processes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
C5 is predominantly associated with immune response-related diseases due to its central role in the complement pathway. Defects or dysregulation in C5 function can lead to susceptibility to infections and contribute to the pathology of autoimmune conditions such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. This gene is also implicated in age-related macular degeneration and certain types of hemolytic uremic syndrome. The complement pathway, in which C5 is a key component, involves several other complement proteins and interacts with various other immune response pathways, influencing inflammation and cellular lysis.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, C5 is significant due to its role in determining the efficacy and response of individuals to certain drugs, particularly those targeting the complement pathway. Drugs such as Eculizumab and Ravulizumab, which are monoclonal antibodies that inhibit C5, have been used in the treatment of diseases like paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. The varying response to these drugs among individuals can be influenced by genetic variations in the C5 gene. As such, understanding the specific genetic makeup of C5 can aid in tailoring personalized treatment plans that improve efficacy and minimize adverse effects in diseases mediated by complement activation.
