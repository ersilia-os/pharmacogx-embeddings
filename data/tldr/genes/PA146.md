## Gene Summary
DPYS, also known as dihydropyrimidinase, is an enzyme encoded by the DPYS gene in humans. This gene is involved in the catabolism of pyrimidine, specifically the degradation of uracil and thymine. DPYS catalyzes the second step in the process, which is the hydrolytic ring opening of dihydrouracil and dihydrothymine. Expression of DPYS can be detected in a variety of tissues, but is particularly high in the liver and kidney, which are central to pyrimidine degradation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The DPYS gene is notably associated with dihydropyrimidinase deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder. This deficiency can lead to a buildup of dihydropyrimidines, which may cause convulsions and epileptic seizures, motor and mental retardation, and autistic features depending on the severity. The buildup of toxic metabolites due to enzyme deficiency is particularly concerning in patients who receive fluoropyrimidine-based drugs, which are metabolized by the pyrimidine degradation pathway. As for pathways, DPYS is a crucial part of the pyrimidine degradation pathway, which is essential for the breakdown and reuse of nucleotides.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, variations in the DPYS gene have implications primarily for patients treated with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and capecitabine, which are commonly used in the treatment of various cancers. DPYS mutations can lead to a reduced or absent activity of dihydropyrimidinase, which can increase the risk of severe toxicity when patients with such mutations are exposed to these drugs. This toxicity manifests due to an accumulation of toxic breakdown products in the body, leading to severe side effects or potentially life-threatening conditions. Testing for DPYS genotypes can be beneficial in adjusting chemotherapy doses and avoiding adverse drug reactions, thereby optimizing patient safety and treatment efficacy.
