## Gene Summary
CA10, also known as Carbonic Anhydrase 10, is a member of the carbonic anhydrase (CA) family of enzymes, which are crucial for the reversible conversion of carbon dioxide and water into carbonic acid, protons, and bicarbonate ions. Although sharing significant sequence similarity with other CA genes, CA10 is catalytically inactive due to the absence of certain key amino acid residues normally essential for enzymatic function. Primarily expressed in the brain, it is suggested that CA10 might play a role in neural signal processing or axon guidance due to its expression in nerve terminals.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
As a pseudogene in terms of its enzymatic capability, CA10 diverges from typical CA functions, focusing possibly on neurological development or functionality given its expression profile. However, specific diseases, conventional drugs, or pathways that are broadly recognized and directly linked to CA10 are not well-established in the typical pharmacological context as of the present knowledge. Studies might be oriented towards understanding its non-enzymatic role in neuronal tissue.

## Pharmacogenetics
Regarding pharmacogenetics, there is minimal to no established direct association between CA10 and specific drug responses or adverse drug reactions. The geneâ€™s inactivity in catalysis suggests a limited or atypical interaction with pharmacological agents that traditionally target active CA family enzymes. Therefore, any potential pharmacogenetic implications of CA10 would likely be non-traditional, possibly related to its neurological roles rather than through typical metabolic pathways impacted by other active CAs. Future research could unravel any indirect effects or novel pharmacogenetic roles of this gene.
