## Gene Summary
NCOA3, also known as nuclear receptor coactivator 3, is a member of the p160/steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family, which includes NCOA1 and NCOA2. This gene plays a critical role in the transcriptional coactivation of various nuclear receptors and other transcription factors such as estrogen receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, and others. NCOA3 is widely expressed in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, and heart. It is crucial for mediating the effects of these receptors on gene expression which influences various cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and metabolism.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NCOA3 has been linked to several cancers, predominantly breast cancer, due to its role in hormone receptor signaling pathways. The gene supports the transcriptional activation of genes involved in cellular growth and proliferation, thereby influencing cancer progression and phenotype. Pathways associated with NCOA3 include estrogen signaling, androgen and thyroid hormone signaling, which play significant roles in the metabolic and developmental processes. Variations in expressions and mutations in this gene have also been studied in connection with obesity and other metabolic syndromes.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, NCOA3 has not been as prominently featured as some other genes in direct drug interactions or modifications. However, it has an indirect influence on therapeutics, especially in the context of hormone-related cancers like breast cancer. Drugs targeting hormone receptors, such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors (e.g., letrozole), may have their efficacy influenced by the functionality of NCOA3, due to its role in hormone receptor coactivation. Understanding individual variations in the NCOA3 gene could contribute to predicting responses to these therapies in cancer treatment, potentially guiding more personalized therapeutic approaches.
