## Gene Summary
CXCL8, also known as interleukin 8, is a chemokine gene that encodes the IL-8 protein, playing an essential role in the immune response. IL-8 is primarily involved in the chemotaxis of neutrophils to sites of infection or inflammation. The protein is produced by macrophages and other cell types such as epithelial cells, airway smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells. CXCL8 is noted for its pro-inflammatory actions, eliciting its effects by binding to its receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CXCL8 is implicated in various inflammatory conditions and has been studied in the context of diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, bronchitis, and various types of cancer, including melanoma. In these disease states, elevated levels of IL-8 contribute to the progression and exacerbation of inflammatory responses. It also plays a critical role in angiogenesis and thus influences tumor growth and metastasis. Pathways associated with CXCL8 include cytokine signaling, inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathway, and JAK-STAT signaling pathway. CXCL8â€™s involvement in these pathways makes it a target for therapeutic interventions in inflammatory diseases and cancer.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of CXCL8 primarily revolves around understanding how variations in its genetic makeup and expression impact response to therapies aimed at managing inflammation and tumor growth. Drugs that potentially interact with CXCL8 or its mediated pathways include reparixin and navarixin, those that target CXCR1 and CXCR2 respectively. These interactions are significant in the context of diseases like metastatic breast cancer and other malignancies where IL-8 mediated angiogenesis and recruitment of tumor-associated leukocytes are key pathological processes. Efforts in targeting CXCL8 signaling are primarily aimed at modulating its activity to alleviate disease symptoms or progression, where the genetic variation in CXCL8 can influence therapeutic outcomes.
