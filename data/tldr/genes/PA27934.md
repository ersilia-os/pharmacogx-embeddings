## Gene Summary
EYA4 (Eyes Absent Homolog 4) is a member of the eyes absent (EYA) family of proteins, which are crucial in the development of various organs and tissues. EYA4, a human homolog of the Drosophila eyes absent gene, functions primarily as a transcriptional activator and plays a significant role in organogenesis, including auditory and renal systems. The protein encoded by EYA4 possesses a phosphatase activity that acts on tyrosine residues and contributes to DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. Expression of EYA4 is noted in several tissues but is most prominent in the heart and developing auditory structures.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in EYA4 have been closely associated with several types of hearing impairment, including autosomal dominant sensorineural hearing loss and age-related hearing loss. Furthermore, EYA4 mutations have links to dilated cardiomyopathy, suggesting a critical role in cardiac function and structure. Its involvement in pathways includes gene expression regulation, DNA damage response, and its interactions with other proteins like the SIX and DACH families, which together contribute to its roles in development and disease pathogenesis.

## Pharmacogenetics
Surrounding the pharmacogenetics of EYA4, there are no significant direct interactions reported between specific drugs and the gene in terms of drug response or drug metabolism. However, its influence in disease pathways, particularly in cardiomyopathy and hearing loss, could indirectly suggest considerations for therapeutic strategies. For instance, its role in cardiomyopathy might impact the response to cardiac drugs, while genetic screening for EYA4 mutations could be critical in the management or preemptive therapy of sensorineural hearing loss. As research continues, further details may elucidate direct pharmacogenetic associations.
