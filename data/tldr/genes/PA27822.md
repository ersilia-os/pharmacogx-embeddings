## Gene Summary
EPHA7 stands for Ephrin Type-A Receptor 7, a member of the Eph receptor family belonging to the protein-tyrosine kinases. The EPHA receptors are unique in that their ligands, ephrins, also function as receptors. EPHA7 mainly participates in developmental processes, managing cell migration and positioning, particularly in the nervous system. It is involved in neuronal cell guidance and communication, as well as vasculature development. Expression of EPHA7 is prevalent in tissues such as brain, placenta, lung, liver, kidney, and pancreas.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
EPHA7 plays roles in diverse biological pathways including axon guidance mediated by Eph receptors and ephrin ligands, developmental processes involving cellular migration and positioning, and influencing neuronal communication. The disruptions or alterations in EPHA7 signaling are linked to various pathological conditions. For instance, EPHA7 has been implicated in some cancer types due to its role in apoptosis and tumor suppression. Interestingly, altered expression of EPHA7 has been noted in several cancer types including leukemia and brain tumors, suggesting a potential role in oncogenesis and tumor progression.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there are limited direct pharmacogenetic associations involving EPHA7 in terms of drug response or drug interactions. Since the gene is mostly connected to developmental processes and cancer, research is more focused on its potential as a biomarker for disease progression or prognosis rather than direct drug targeting. However, ongoing studies in the realm of cancer therapy explore targeting Eph receptors, including EPHA7, to potentially interrupt cancer-related pathways. Understanding the pharmacogenetics of EPHA7 could lead to advancements in personalized medicine, particularly concerning cancer treatment strategies that hinge on modulating receptor tyrosine kinase activity.
