## Gene Summary
OPCML, or opioid binding protein/cell adhesion molecule-like, is a gene implicated in the encoding of the OPCML protein, part of the IgLON family which consists of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell adhesion molecules. The protein plays a significant role in various cellular processes including signal transduction and cell adhesion. OPCML is widely expressed in different tissue types but is predominantly noted in neural tissues. It is implicated in the modulation of a range of opioid receptors by serving as an opioid-binding protein.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
OPCML is associated with the pathophysiology of several cancers, particularly ovarian cancer. Its expression is often downregulated in ovarian and other cancers, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor gene. The underexpression of OPCML has been linked to a poorer prognosis in cancer patients, highlighting its potential significance in cancer progression and metastasis. The study of OPCML involves pathways related to cell adhesion, cellular signaling, and tumor suppression mechanisms. Due to its implications in cancer, OPCML is also a target for cancer biomarker research and therapeutic strategies.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the domain of pharmacogenetics, OPCML does not have a wide array of associations with specific drugs when compared to genes more directly involved with drug metabolism or drug targets. However, understanding the expressions and mechanistic action of OPCML may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic approaches, particularly in the treatment of cancers like ovarian cancer where it is significantly implicated. There are ongoing investigations into how modulation of OPCML, or pathways associated with it, could be therapeutically beneficial or used to enhance the efficacy of existing cancer treatments. The gene's role in cell adhesion and interaction with opioid receptors might also provide insights into tailored therapeutic strategies in pain management and neurological disorders in the future.
