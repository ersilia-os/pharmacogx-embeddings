## Gene Summary
CALCA, also known as calcitonin-related polypeptide alpha, plays a critical role in the regulation of numerous physiological functions, such as calcium homeostasis and vasodilation. This gene encodes two products via tissue-specific alternative RNA splicing: calcitonin and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Calcitonin is primarily produced in C cells of the thyroid and is involved in the reduction of blood calcium levels by inhibiting osteoclast activity in the bones and increasing calcium excretion in the kidneys. CGRP, on the other hand, is a potent vasodilator and is expressed predominantly in the nervous system.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CALCA's peptides, particularly CGRP, are linked to several pathological conditions, predominantly migraine and inflammation. CGRP's role in vasodilation has made it a key focus for migraine research, leading to the development of CGRP receptor antagonists and antibodies that target either the ligand or its receptor. Apart from migraines, variations in CGRP levels or function have also been connected to conditions such as hypertension, metabolic bone disorders, and potentially to inflammatory diseases due to its immunomodulatory effects. 

## Pharmacogenetics
Interest in the pharmacogenetics of CALCA primarily revolves around its product CGRP, which has led to advancements in migraine treatment. CGRP receptor antagonists, like erenumab, and ligand-targeting monoclonal antibodies such as fremanezumab and galcanezumab, have been developed to neutralize CGRP's effects. These drugs represent a novel class of migraine preventive treatments that have shown efficacy in reducing the frequency of migraine attacks in patients. However, the pharmacogenetic response to these treatments may vary, suggesting genetic variations in the CALCA gene or its pathway might influentially stratify patientsâ€™ responsiveness to therapy, although detailed genetic markers are still under investigation.
