## Gene Summary
EXO1, or Exonuclease 1, is a human gene essential for DNA repair, replication, and recombination. The protein encoded by EXO1 possesses 5'â†’3' exonuclease activity and participates critically in mismatch repair (MMR) to maintain genome stability and avoid malignant cell transformation. EXO1 can interact with other MMR proteins like MLH1 and MSH2 and is also involved in the processing of DNA double-strand breaks, making it integral to both the homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair pathways.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations and dysregulation of EXO1 have been implicated in various cancer types, emphasizing its role in genomic integrity. Loss of EXO1 function is particularly associated with increased susceptibility to colorectal and gastric cancers. The role of EXO1 in DNA repair pathways highlights its potential connection to cancer susceptibility phenotypes, specifically in Lynch syndrome where mismatch repair is compromised. Furthermore, EXO1 functions in a network of pathways that interact with a wide range of cellular processes including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic investigations of EXO1 have primarily focused on the implications of genetic variations impacting cancer treatment outcomes. Polymorphisms in EXO1, such as specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been studied for their effects on the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents especially those that induce DNA damage, such as platinum-based compounds. For example, variations in EXO1 can influence the response to drugs like cisplatin and carboplatin in patients with cancers where DNA repair capability is a determining factor for therapeutic efficacy. Understanding the influence of EXO1 variants on drug response and toxicity could guide personalized treatment strategies in oncology, particularly in enhancing the effectiveness of DNA-damaging agents.
