## Gene Summary
SULT1E1, or Sulfotransferase Family 1E Member 1, is an enzyme encoded by the SULT1E1 gene in humans. It primarily functions to catalyze the sulfation of steroids, a critical process for the metabolism and inactivation of estrogens. SULT1E1 is expressed in various tissues, but it is particularly abundant in liver and adrenal glands. The enzyme plays a crucial role in hormone homeostasis and has implications in steroid-related diseases.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SULT1E1 has a significant association with the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of hormones and hormone-like drugs. The gene is relevant in the context of diseases such as hormone-dependent cancers (e.g., breast and endometrial cancer), due to its role in estrogen metabolism. SULT1E1 is also implicated in other estrogen-related disorders like endometriosis and obesity. Regarding biological pathways, SULT1E1 is crucial in the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway, which influences various physiological processes and disease states through its regulation of hormone levels.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, the activity of SULT1E1 can profoundly affect the efficacy and toxicity of certain drugs, particularly those that are estrogens or that interact with estrogen pathways. The enzyme's ability to sulfate and thereby inactivate estrogens can influence the therapeutic outcomes of estrogen replacement therapies and contraceptives. Moreover, inter-individual variations in SULT1E1 activity, due to genetic polymorphisms, can affect drug response and susceptibility to side effects in treatments involving such drugs. This makes SULT1E1 a potential target for personalized medicine, especially in the treatment and management of estrogen-related conditions.
