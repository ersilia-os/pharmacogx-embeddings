## Gene Summary
NR1H3, also known as Liver X Receptor alpha (LXR-alpha), is a nuclear receptor and transcription factor involved in the regulation of several metabolic pathways, particularly those related to cholesterol, fatty acid, and glucose metabolism. It is expressed predominantly in the liver, adipose tissue, macrophages, and intestines. NR1H3 functions primarily by forming heterodimers with another nuclear receptor, RXR (retinoid X receptor), which then binds to specific response elements on DNA to regulate the transcription of target genes. This gene plays a critical role in the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis and the inflammatory response.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NR1H3 is implicated in the metabolic syndrome due to its regulation of lipid metabolism, and its modulation has therapeutic potential in the treatment of atherosclerosis, obesity, diabetes, and chronic inflammation. The receptor's activation influences the expression of genes involved in reverse cholesterol transport, fatty acid biosynthesis, and glucose metabolism, thereby impacting these metabolic processes. In disease contexts, NR1H3 has been associated with conditions such as cardiovascular diseases due to its role in regulating cholesterol levels and inflammatory response often seen in these pathologies.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of NR1H3 primarily involves its role as a target for modulators used in the treatment of metabolic disorders. Drugs such as T0901317 and GW3965 have been studied as LXR agonists, which activate NR1H3 to confer beneficial effects on lipid profile and glucose homeostasis. However, the development and use of these drugs are complicated by side effects like hypertriglyceridemia, emphasizing the need for selective agonists or alternative approaches to modulate NR1H3 activity therapeutically. Understanding individual genetic variations in NR1H3 might predict response to these treatments and tailor therapies to manage hypercholesterolemia and diabetes effectively.
