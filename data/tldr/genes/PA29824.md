## Gene Summary
IL23A, also known as Interleukin 23 Subunit Alpha, is a gene encoding the p19 subunit of interleukin-23 (IL-23). This cytokine is crucial for the functioning of a unique subset of T-cells known as Th17 cells, which are significant in inflammatory processes. IL23A forms a heterodimeric cytokine with IL12B, which together constitute IL-23. This cytokine is involved in the upregulation of the inflammatory response and has been found particularly active in the immune systems of the gut and skin. IL-23 has a critical role in autoimmune diseases due to its effects on cytokine production and immune cell proliferation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
IL23A is primarily associated with the pathogenesis of several chronic inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. This gene's product, IL-23, is a target for several immunomodulatory drugs designed to tame the inflammatory response in these conditions. Pathways involving IL23A include the Th17 cell differentiation and cytokine signaling in the immune system, highlighting its pivotal role in managing immune balance and inflammatory responses. These pathways are critical for understanding how dysfunctional immune regulation leads to chronic inflammation and autoimmunity.

## Pharmacogenetics
The expression and function of IL23A have direct pharmacogenetic implications, especially concerning the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Drugs like Ustekinumab and Guselkumab target the IL-23 pathway for treating conditions like psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Ustekinumab binds to the p40 subunit shared by IL-12 and IL-23, thereby inhibiting the activity of IL-23 and affecting the Th17 pathway. Guselkumab specifically targets the p19 subunit encoded by IL23A, which offers a more selective inhibition of IL-23. These pharmacogenetic insights are crucial for developing personalized medical interventions in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, substantially altering disease progression and patient quality of life by targeting specific aspects of the IL-23 mediated immune response.
