## Gene Summary
PROCR, which stands for Protein C Receptor, endoribonuclease also known as the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), is a gene involved in the protein C anticoagulation pathway. The encoded protein acts as a cellular receptor for protein C, a serine protease with potent anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective properties. PROCR is predominantly expressed in the endothelial cells of large blood vessels and plays a crucial role in modulating blood coagulation and inflammation. This receptor also supports the activation of protein C and its function in antithrombotic response, endothelial barrier protection, and anti-inflammatory activities.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
PROCR is pivotal in the pathway of blood coagulation, specifically impacting diseases linked to thrombosis and inflammatory states. It is directly related to the protein C pathway, where defects or deficiencies can lead to increased risk of thrombosis, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The geneâ€™s role extends to various inflammatory responses, making it relevant in the context of diseases such as sepsis where the regulation of inflammation and coagulation are critical. Additionally, mutations in PROCR have been associated with purpura fulminans, a rare and severe condition of intravascular thrombosis and skin necrosis.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of PROCR are primarily linked to its influences in coagulation and anticoagulant therapies. Variation in the PROCR gene can affect the efficacy and safety of anticoagulant drugs, particularly those that influence the protein C pathway. For instance, drugs that are used to manage thrombosis and sepsis may have variable effects depending on the genetic variants present in the individual's PROCR gene. This makes the role of PROCR significant for personalized medicine approaches in conditions involving thrombosis and inflammation. Further research is ongoing to elucidate more precise pharmacogenetic associations and to develop tailored therapeutic strategies that account for genetic variability in PROCR.
