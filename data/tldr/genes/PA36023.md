## Gene Summary
SORT1 (sortilin 1) is a gene that encodes the sortilin protein, which is a multi-ligand type-1 receptor with a broad expression profile, notably in heart, brain, and liver. Sortilin is involved in several cellular processes including intracellular protein transport, protein sorting, and signaling. It plays a significant role in the regulation of neurotrophin trafficking and apoptosis in neuronal cells. SORT1 is implicated in the metabolism of lipoproteins and influences cholesterol homeostasis and atherosclerosis development.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SORT1 is linked to various health conditions primarily connected to cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. The gene has been associated with alterations in lipid profiles, most prominently in the regulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, thus impacting atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. Pathways involving SORT1 include lipid metabolism, apoptosis, and endocytosis, highlighting its comprehensive role in cellular functioning. Genetic variations in SORT1 have also been explored for their phenotypic impacts on neuronal diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, given its role in neuronal viability.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, SORT1's interactions with drugs, particularly those used in the treatment and management of hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular diseases, are of interest. Although specific drugs targeting SORT1 directly are limited, its role in cholesterol metabolism makes it a potential target for statin therapy and possibly new therapeutic agents aimed at modulating LDL cholesterol levels. Research on SORT1 could lead to enhanced personalized medicine approaches, especially in predicting individual responses to lipid-lowering therapies and in the development of novel therapeutic interventions targeting cholesterol pathways influenced by sortilin actions.
