## Gene Summary
SULT1A3, or Sulfotransferase Family 1A Member 3, is an enzyme that belongs to the sulfotransferase family. These enzymes are involved in the sulfate conjugation of catecholamines, including dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine in the liver and gastrointestinal tract. This process plays a crucial role in the metabolism and detoxification of various xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. The expression of SULT1A3 is predominantly in the gut, with lower levels observed in the liver and other tissues. The enzyme contributes significantly to the presystemic metabolism of neurotransmitters and drugs taken orally.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SULT1A3 is primarily associated with the metabolism of drugs that act on the central nervous system, including antidepressants and antipsychotics. It is also implicated in the sulfation and inactivation of certain toxins and environmental chemicals. Disruption in the activity of SULT1A3 can influence susceptibility to neurological disorders and certain types of cancers, particularly those influenced by exposure to environmental toxins that are substrates of this enzyme. Moreover, polymorphisms in SULT1A3 have been linked to variation in blood pressure and hypertension, potentially through altered catecholamine metabolism.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of SULT1A3 involves its role in modulating the effects and efficacy of certain drugs through its sulfation activity. Altered function due to genetic variations can affect the therapeutic outcomes of drugs metabolized by SULT1A3. For example, polymorphisms in SULT1A3 might influence the metabolism and effectiveness of dopamine-active drugs used in psychiatric disorders, although specific drugs directly associated with SULT1A3 variations are still under investigation. Understanding SULT1A3 pharmacogenetics is important in personalizing treatment plans for diseases influenced by catecholamine pathways and in predicting response to toxins and drugs requiring metabolism through sulfation.
