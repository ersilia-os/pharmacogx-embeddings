## Gene Summary
DHRS13, or Dehydrogenase/Reductase 13, is a protein-coding gene involved in the metabolism of various substrates through its role in oxidoreduction processes. DHRS13 belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) family, which play critical roles in lipid, amino acid, carbohydrate, and steroid metabolism. The gene is expressed in various tissues, but its expression levels and functional implications vary widely across different types of human tissues such as the heart and liver. The specific substrates and biochemical pathways associated with DHRS13 are not comprehensively characterized.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
At this stage, the specific implications of DHRS13 in clinical diseases, drug interactions, or distinctive phenotypes are relatively unexplored in research. Given its enzymatic role, the gene could be implicated indirectly in metabolic pathways relevant to diseases associated with metabolism dysregulation. However, detailed pathways, drug targets, or direct disease correlations have not yet been robustly established or widely recognized in standard bioinformatics resources or clinical settings.

## Pharmacogenetics
Current knowledge on pharmacogenetic associations of DHRS13 with specific drugs is limited. There is no substantial evidence linking DHRS13 directly with pharmacogenetic outcomes affecting drug efficacy or safety at this point. This highlights a gap in the research and potentially an area for future explorations to determine how variations in this gene could influence individual responses to therapeutic agents, considering the geneâ€™s enzymatic activity and its possible roles in metabolic processes. Further studies are essential to establish any relevant pharmacogenetic interactions involving DHRS13.
