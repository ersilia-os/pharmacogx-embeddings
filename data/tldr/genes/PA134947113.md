## Gene Summary
RUSC1, also known as RUN and SH3 domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in neural functioning and development. The protein encoded by RUSC1 interacts with components of the vesicular transport pathway and with the PDZ domain-containing proteins. It is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions like the hippocampus, which is crucial for memory and learning. The RUSC1 protein has roles in directing endosomal trafficking, influencing neuronal growth, and potentially impacting synaptic plasticity.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
There is limited information on direct associations of RUSC1 with specific drugs or diseases. However, its involvement in neurological pathways suggests a potential link to neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual disabilities or neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Its role in neuronal wiring and synaptic structure implies its influence may extend to neurological disorders where these processes are disrupted. The pathways involving RUSC1 largely relate to neural development and signaling processes, emphasizing its importance in proper cognitive and neural function.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics profile of RUSC1 is not extensively documented, and there are no direct, well-established pharmacogenetic associations involving common drugs. Due to its function in neural processes, any pharmacogenetic implications would potentially relate to drugs affecting neurological function or psychotropic medications. Future research could reveal whether variations in RUSC1 could influence drug efficacy or susceptibility to side effects in treatments of neurological or psychiatric conditions. However, as of the last update, specific pharmacogenetic associations involving RUSC1 remain to be identified and documented in clinical settings.
