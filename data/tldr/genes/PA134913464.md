## Gene Summary
CYP26C1, officially known as Cytochrome P450 Family 26 Subfamily C Member 1, is a gene involved in the metabolism of retinoic acid (RA), a primary active metabolite of vitamin A. This gene encodes an enzyme that acts primarily in the oxidative metabolism of all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA), which is critical for regulating concentrations of RA in tissues and organs. CYP26C1 shares close similarity with other members of the CYP26 family but exhibits distinct expression patterns and substrate specificities. The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, where it potentially plays a role in embryonic development by regulating RA levels, thus influencing neural development and function.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CYP26C1 is vital in the retinoic acid metabolism pathway, which is crucial for cellular differentiation and organogenesis. Dysregulation of RA levels, possibly influenced by CYP26C1 activity variations, is implicated in developmental disorders and diseases such as microphthalmia and other congenital anomalies. Although not as extensively studied as other CYP26 family members, CYP26C1's role in modulating retinoic acid levels suggests its potential influence in disorders associated with vitamin A metabolism. The gene's expression and enzyme activity are critical during embryonic development, emphasizing its importance in mediating the effects of retinoic acid spatially and temporally within the embryo.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of CYP26C1 is relatively underexplored compared to more prominent CYP family members involved directly in drug metabolism. However, understanding variations within the CYP26C1 gene could be crucial for therapies involving retinoids, which are used extensively in dermatology and oncology. Retinoids such as isotretinoin and acitretin are metabolized by enzymes in the CYP26 family, and variations in CYP26C1 might affect the efficacy and toxicity profiles of these treatments. Further pharmacogenetic research is needed to delineate fully the impacts of genetic variants within CYP26C1 on the metabolism of retinoid medications and the consequent therapeutic outcomes.
