## Gene Summary
ZNF385D (Zinc Finger Protein 385D) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional regulation. The protein belongs to the zinc finger protein family, which particularly plays roles in DNA binding and interaction with other transcription factors. Being a transcriptional regulator, ZNF385D influences the expression of various target genes, which are involved in developmental and cellular processes. The specific mechanisms by which ZNF385D affects cellular functions are still under exploration, but it is known to be expressed in a variety of tissues, suiting its role as a general transcriptional modulator.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Research on ZNF385D has not yet extensively connected it to specific drugs or targeted therapeutic interventions. However, studies have shown some associations with diseases, particularly in the context of cancer biology. In terms of phenotypes, alterations in ZNF385D expression levels or mutation statuses have been implicated in the cellular processes that might affect cancer development and progression. The pathways involving ZNF385D generally relate to its role in gene expression regulation, although the detailed pathways are still being defined.

## Pharmacogenetics
As of the current scientific understanding, pharmacogenetic associations involving ZNF385D are relatively unexplored or undocumented. The gene does not have a direct link to pharmacogenomics databases for specific drug response variability. Further research is necessary to determine whether ZNF385D has pharmacogenetic relevance, potentially influencing drug efficacy, toxicity, or patient-specific treatment responses. As such, the exploration into the pharmacogenetics of ZNF385D remains a prospective area for future scientific studies.
