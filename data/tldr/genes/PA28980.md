## Gene Summary
GRIN2B (Glutamate Ionotropic Receptor NMDA Type Subunit 2B) is a gene that encodes a critical subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which are involved in excitatory neurotransmission through the synaptic signaling between neurons in the brain. These receptors are heterotetrameric protein complexes typically composed of multiple subunits, with GRIN2B providing specific properties related to channel kinetics, ion selectivity, and pharmacology of the receptor complex. GRIN2B is predominantly expressed in the brain and plays a vital role in synaptic plasticity, neuronal development, and neurodegeneration.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
GRIN2B has been implicated in various neurological disorders due to its crucial role in brain function and development. Diseases associated with mutations or dysregulation of GRIN2B include intellectual disability, epilepsy, autism spectrum disorders, and schizophrenia. The geneâ€™s influence on neuronal communication and plasticity makes it a critical player in learning and memory processes. Pathways involving GRIN2B often focus on neurotransmitter signaling, with particular emphasis on glutamatergic signaling and calcium signaling pathways that are fundamental to neuronal activity and survival.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, GRIN2B has been studied in the context of response to certain psychotropic drugs, though extensive clinically actionable pharmacogenetic data specific to this gene may still be developing. Memantine, an Alzheimer's disease medication that works as an NMDA receptor antagonist, indirectly affects the function of receptors containing the GRIN2B subunit. While direct associations between specific GRIN2B variants and drug response are limited, research continues into how genetic differences in GRIN2B might influence the efficacy and safety profiles of drugs that target NMDA receptor functions, particularly in the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders.
