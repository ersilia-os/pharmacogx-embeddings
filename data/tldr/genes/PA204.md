## Gene Summary
**ITGA2** (Integrin Subunit Alpha 2) encodes a protein that is a member of the integrin family. Integrins are heterodimeric integral membrane proteins composed of an alpha chain and a beta chain. The protein encoded by ITGA2 combines with the beta 1 subunit to form a receptor for collagen and related proteins. This protein plays a significant role in cell adhesion, migration, and cellular signaling, impacting various cellular processes including immune response, wound healing, and cancer metastasis. ITGA2 is widely expressed in tissues such as the heart, muscle, and platelets, and is also found on the surface of many cell types.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The ITGA2 gene is implicated in several diseases and pathological conditions primarily through its role in cell adhesion and migration. Abnormalities in ITGA2 expression and function have been associated with disorders such as coronary artery disease, thrombophilia, and various types of cancer including lung and breast cancer. The gene's involvement in cell attachment and interaction with the extracellular matrix makes it crucial in wound healing processes and immune response. In terms of pathways, ITGA2 is involved in collagen synthesis and deposition, integrin signaling pathways, and has roles in the activation of various signaling molecules and pathways that contribute to cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic research on ITGA2 has revealed associations primarily with diseases and their treatments rather than specific drug interactions. For instance, polymorphisms in ITGA2 have been linked to variability in the effectiveness and risk profiles of treatments in coronary artery disease and cancer. Certain variants of the ITGA2 gene might influence the prognosis or therapeutic outcomes in patients receiving treatments that affect cell adhesion and migration, including therapies aimed at inhibiting tumor metastasis or promoting wound healing. Although direct associations with specific drugs are currently less well-defined, understanding the genetic implications of ITGA2 in disease can potentially guide more personalized therapeutic strategies and impact the management of diseases associated with this gene's function and expression.
