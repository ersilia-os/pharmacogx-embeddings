## Gene Summary
BDKRB2 stands for "Bradykinin Receptor B2." It encodes a receptor for bradykinin, a physiologically and pharmacologically active peptide of the kinin group of proteins, particularly involved in inflammation and pain. BDKRB2 is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) associated with mediating increased endothelial permeability, smooth muscle relaxation, immune response, and other biochemical changes associated with inflammatory reactions. It is predominantly expressed in various tissues including the cardiovascular system, central nervous system, and in various cells involved in the inflammatory response. The gene plays a crucial role in signaling pathways that influence blood pressure regulation, pain sensation, and vascular tone.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Bradykinin, the ligand for BDKRB2, and its related pathways are implicated in several cardiovascular and inflammatory conditions. Dysfunction or aberrant signaling of this receptor can contribute to conditions such as asthma, anaphylactic shock, and other hypersensitivity responses. The BDKRB2 pathway's involvement in vasodilation and edema is particularly significant in the context of hypertension and myocardial infarction. Pharmacologically, BDKRB2 is a target for drugs aimed at treating these conditions by manipulating bradykinin levels or modifying receptor interactions to influence vascular smooth muscle contraction and blood vessel permeability.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, variations in BDKRB2 are examined for their potential to affect individual responses to drugs targeting the kallikrein-kinin system. The gene's variations might influence the efficacy and safety of these therapeutics, impacting clinical outcomes in diseases where bradykinin activity is a key pathological factor. For example, in the context of antihypertensive treatments that affect the renin-angiotensin system (such as ACE inhibitors), genetic variants of BDKRB2 can modulate the degree to which blood pressure is lowered. The study of these genetic associations aims to tailor therapeutic approaches based on genetic profiles to enhance efficacy and reduce adverse effects in treatments involving bradykinin-mediated pathways.
