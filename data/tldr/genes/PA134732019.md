## Gene Summary
ALG10 (Asparagine-linked Glycosylation 10 Homolog) is a gene involved in the glycosylation process, specifically in the protein N-glycosylation pathway. This gene encodes a protein that acts as a glycosyltransferase, responsible for the transfer of glucose molecules to the growing lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor. ALG10 primarily functions in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it catalyzes the addition of glucose residues to dolichol-linked oligosaccharides. This activity is crucial for proper folding and maturation of glycoproteins.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The function of ALG10 is particularly relevant in the context of congenital disorders of glycosylation, where defects in the glycosylation pathway lead to various clinical phenotypes. ALG10 deficiency can result in developmental delays, neurological impairments, and other systemic manifestations, highlighting the importance of precise glycosylation in human health. Research has shown that pathway dysregulation associated with ALG10 could potentially impact several physiological systems, influencing our understanding of both rare and common diseases where glycosylation plays a role.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic associations for ALG10 are not extensively documented in contrast to other genes more prominently linked with drug metabolism and efficacy. Due to its fundamental role in glycosylation, mutations or variants in ALG10 might indirectly affect the pharmacodynamics of glycoprotein-targeting drugs. This could potentially alter drug efficacy and safety, making it a potential area for future pharmacogenetic investigations, especially in therapies involving biological products where glycosylation status affects therapeutic outcomes. Understanding these interactions could lead to more personalized approaches in managing diseases that relate to glycosylation abnormalities, although current data is limited.
