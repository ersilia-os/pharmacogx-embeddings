## Gene Summary
XIRP2, officially known as Xin actin-binding repeat containing 2, is a gene that encodes a protein linked to the actin cytoskeleton. XIRP2 is primarily expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles and plays a crucial role in muscle cell differentiation and maintenance. Furthermore, it is involved in the structural integrity and function of striated muscles. The gene's protein product is known to interact with actin and modulate the cytoskeletal architecture, which is essential for muscle fiber stability and function.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
XIRP2 has been less extensively studied compared to other genes with respect to its involvement in diseases and drug interactions. However, mutations and malfunction of XIRP2 have been tentatively associated with muscle-related diseases due to its fundamental role in muscle cell function and integrity. For instance, it is thought to potentially contribute to cardiomyopathies and other muscle degenerative disorders. The pathways involving XIRP2 are predominantly those related to muscle development and maintenance, as well as those linking to cytoskeletal arrangement and cellular integrity.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics aspect of XIRP2 is relatively underexplored, with minimal direct associations currently established between XIRP2 and specific drug responses or pharmacological interventions. Due to its primary involvement in muscle structure and function, future research could potentially uncover its role in influencing the effectiveness or adverse reactions to treatments in muscle-related disorders, such as in the management of cardiomyopathies or muscle dystrophies. As of now, there are no specific drugs known to interact directly with XIRP2 or its pathways that are documented with robust pharmacogenetic data for clinical use.
