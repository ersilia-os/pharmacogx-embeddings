## Gene Summary
EPHA5, officially known as EPH Receptor A5, is a member of the Eph receptor tyrosine kinase family, which is notable for its roles in developmental processes, particularly in neurogenesis and neuronal migration. EPHA5 is expressed prominently in the nervous system. Its primary functions involve mediating developmental events, especially in the brain, through the interaction with membrane-bound ephrin ligands. This interaction is crucial for the spatial organization of cell assemblies and accurate neural mapping, which influences neuronal connectivity and plasticity.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
EPHA5's interactions and signaling pathways are significant in neuronal development and neural circuit formation. Alterations or mutations in EPHA5 and its signaling pathways can influence neural development disorders and have been implicated in several forms of cancer, such as lung and breast cancer, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis and tumor migration. Research suggests that EPHA5 might influence several cancer-related pathways, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions. In neurology, variations in EPHA5 have been studied in relation to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, although direct associations are still under investigation.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the realm of pharmacogenetics, research on EPHA5 primarily explores its role and implications in cancer therapy rather than direct associations with specific drugs. However, the understanding of EPHA5 functions in cancer pathways can guide the selective use of kinase inhibitors that might affect EPHA5 signaling. Given its involvement in tumor growth and progression, drugs targeting the Eph receptors or their ephrin ligands could potentially be influenced by the genetic variations in EPHA5. Although there are currently no specific drugs targeting EPHA5 directly approved for clinical use, its role in the pathology of diseases offers a promising avenue for future drug development and personalized medicine strategies.
