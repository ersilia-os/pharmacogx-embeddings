## Gene Summary
CHD1L, or chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 1-like, is a gene involved in the regulation of DNA packaging and modification of chromatin structures, thereby influencing transcription. The gene codes for an enzyme with helicase and DNA-binding activities that play a crucial role in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. CHD1L is particularly noted for its role in the response to DNA damage and the maintenance of chromosome integrity. The gene is expressed in various tissues, with significant implications in liver, kidney, and testicular functions.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CHD1L has been implicated in several pathways related to DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, and carcinogenesis. Due to its role in these fundamental cellular processes, mutations and alterations in the expression of CHD1L are associated with a number of disease states, particularly cancer. Notably, CHD1L is involved in the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and has been studied in the context of other cancers such as breast cancer and ovarian cancer. The gene's involvement in DNA repair pathways also suggests a broader implication in genomic stability and response to cellular stress.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of CHD1L is still an emerging field with limited specific drugs directly targeting its activity. However, understanding CHD1L's role in DNA repair and cancer pathways holds potential implications for tailored therapies in oncology, specifically in drugs targeting DNA repair mechanisms or chromatin remodeling processes. Research into CHD1L may influence the effectiveness and choice of chemotherapeutic agents, particularly in cancers where CHD1L is known to be overexpressed or mutated. Further studies are needed to precisely define pharmacogenetic interactions and to develop potential therapeutic interventions involving CHD1L in clinical settings.
