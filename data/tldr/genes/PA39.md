## Gene Summary
ADRB2 is the official symbol for the Beta-2 adrenergic receptor gene, which encodes a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. This receptor is located mainly in the smooth muscle of blood vessels and the airways, which are critical targets in the treatment of asthma, COPD, and vascular diseases. The ADRB2 gene plays a crucial role in the regulation of myocardial function, bronchial dilation, and glycogenolysis by mediating catecholamine-induced activation of adenylate cyclase. It is highly polymorphic, meaning that genetic variation within this gene influences receptor function and the physiological response to adrenaline.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ADRB2 is associated with multiple pharmacological and pathological contexts, primarily due to its impact on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. It is targeted by a variety of beta-blockers and beta-agonists, such as albuterol, which are used in the treatment of asthma, bronchospasms, and hypertension. This receptor is also involved in the physiological response to stress and the fight-or-flight (sympathetic) reaction, thus playing a role in conditions like heart failure and hypertension. Besides, ADRB2 is part of important signaling pathways such as the G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, which involves second messenger systems, and is vital in responses to hormones like adrenaline and noradrenaline. 

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of ADRB2 is especially relevant in the context of respiratory and cardiovascular therapies. Variants within ADRB2, such as Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu, have been shown to affect the responses to medications like albuterol in treatments for asthma and COPD. For instance, some polymorphisms lead to a decrease in response to these treatments, impacting clinical decisions regarding drug choice and dosage. The evidence suggests an association between specific ADRB2 genetic variants and differential response rates, enhanced or reduced efficacy, and variation in adverse effects profiles. Hence, knowing a patient’s ADRB2 genotype can potentially guide more personalized, effective, and safer therapy options in conditions involving the β2-adrenergic receptor.
