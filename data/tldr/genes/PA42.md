## Gene Summary
The official gene symbol AGT stands for angiotensinogen. It is primarily synthesized in the liver and circulates in the plasma. AGT serves as the precursor to angiotensin I, which is subsequently converted into angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor involved in blood pressure regulation and fluid-electrolyte balance. Angiotensin II functions through its effects on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), playing a crucial role in cardiovascular system regulation, having implications for hypertension and other cardiovascular disorders.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
AGT is strongly connected to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) pathway, a critical regulator of blood pressure and fluid balance. Abnormalities in this gene are associated with various cardiovascular diseases, primarily hypertension. Phenotypically, alterations in AGT expression or function can lead to increased vasoconstriction, sodium retention, and elevated blood pressure. This linkage underscores its involvement in disorders such as myocardial infarction and renal pathologies. Given its role in blood pressure regulation, AGT is also a target for pharmacological intervention, particularly in the development of antihypertensive drugs.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of AGT is especially relevant to antihypertensive therapy. Polymorphisms in this gene, such as the M235T variant, have been associated with variations in response to drugs targeting the RAAS pathway. Individuals carrying certain AGT variants may show different therapeutic outcomes when treated with ACE inhibitors (like enalapril and lisinopril), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs like losartan and valsartan), and renin inhibitors. The response to these drugs can vary based on AGT genetic variants, influencing treatment efficacy and the risk of adverse effects. Knowledge of an individual's AGT genotype can aid in personalizing treatment plans, optimizing drug choice and dosing to maximize therapeutic benefit and minimize potential risks.
