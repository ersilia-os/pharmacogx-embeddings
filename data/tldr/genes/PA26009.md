## Gene Summary
CACNA1E is the official symbol for the calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 E. This gene encodes one of the members of the alpha-1 subunit family, which is part of the voltage-dependent calcium channel complex crucial for calcium influx after depolarization. The CACNA1E-encoded protein is specifically involved in high voltage-activated calcium channels, primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in the cerebellum. It plays a critical role in neurotransmission and muscle contraction by mediating calcium entry into the cell, which is essential for initiating several signal transduction pathways.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CACNA1E mutations are linked to distinct neurological conditions, including epilepsy and developmental disorders. Specifically, it has been associated with disorders such as developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. This gene's involvement in calcium signaling impacts excitation-transcription coupling, which influences neuronal growth and development, and thus, its dysfunction can lead to various neurological phenotypic manifestations. The calcium channels formed with CACNA1E are also potentially significant in other areas, such as pain perception and cardiovascular function, leading to research into their involvement in broader physiological and pathological pathways.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of CACNA1E primarily involves its role in neurological disorders, influencing the therapeutic outcomes of various antiepileptic drugs. While specific drug interactions and guidance in pharmacogenetics for CACNA1E are still under investigation, it is of keen interest due to its potential in influencing responses to treatments like calcium channel blockers. These observations might drive personalized medicine approaches in treating associated epilepsy forms, particularly in precision dosing or choices amongst antiepileptic medications, though concrete associations with specific drugs are yet to be exhaustively defined in clinical contexts.
