## Gene Summary
INVS, also known as inversin, is a gene that encodes a protein vital for the development and function of cilia, which are microscopic, hair-like structures on the surface of cells. These structures play crucial roles in cellular signaling pathways and fluid movement across cell surfaces. The gene is particularly significant in the renal cells and other tissues, where defects in ciliary function are associated with a range of pathological conditions. By influencing the Wnt signaling pathway, INVS has implications in both developmental processes and diseases.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The dysfunction of the INVS gene is directly linked to nephronophthisis, a genetic disorder that primarily affects the kidneys and can lead to renal failure. This condition is characterized by the inflammation and degeneration of renal tubules, leading to fibrosis and the formation of cysts. INVS is part of a complex network involving multiple cellular signaling pathways, including Wnt signaling, which is crucial in developmental processes and in maintaining proper renal structure and function. The involvement of INVS in these pathways makes it a potential target for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating these pathways in various diseases.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of INVS primarily revolves around its role in the pathology of nephronophthisis and potentially related ciliopathies. While direct pharmacogenetic interactions with specific drugs have not been well-established or documented at this point, understanding how variations in the INVS gene affect disease progression and response to treatment could influence therapeutic approaches in nephronophthisis. Further research is needed to determine specific drug-gene interactions and the potential for utilizing INVS as a marker for responsiveness to treatment in renal and possibly other ciliopathic conditions.
