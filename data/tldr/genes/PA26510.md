## Gene Summary
CHUK, also known as conserved helix-loop-helix ubiquitous kinase, is a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family and the NF-kappa-B inhibitor kinase subfamily. It is essential for the activation of the NF-κB pathway, which plays a pivotal role in inflammation, immunity, cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. CHUK phosphorylates 'inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells, kinase beta' (IKBKB) on serine residues, which leads to the degradation of inhibitors of NF-κB and subsequently, the activation of NF-κB. The enzyme is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and has been implicated in regulating a variety of cellular pathways.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CHUK is associated with numerous cellular pathways primarily related to immune response and inflammation. Abnormalities in CHUK function and signaling can lead to various inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. Given its central role in NF-κB pathway activation, CHUK is implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and other inflammatory diseases. Research has also explored its involvement in oncogenic processes, suggesting potential implications in cancer therapies targeting NF-κB signaling.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic research involving CHUK primarily focuses on its role in modulating responses to treatments in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, where NF-κB plays a critical role. Although specific pharmacogenetic associations between CHUK and particular drugs are not widely documented, inhibitors that affect the NF-κB pathway may have varying effects depending on the genetic variations within CHUK. Understanding these associations could lead to more personalized approaches in managing diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or potentially in oncology, where pathway-specific therapies might be tailored based on an individual's CHUK genotype. Further studies are needed to better establish these pharmacogenetic relationships.
