## Gene Summary
GDNF, standing for Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, is a critical protein in the GDNF family of ligands which play a significant role in the survival and maintenance of various types of neurons. Key aspects of GDNF’s function include promoting the survival of dopaminergic neurons in the central nervous system, which are crucial for motor control and have implications in Parkinson's disease. GDNF also affects renal development and spermatogenesis. The gene is widely expressed in multiple human tissues, including the central nervous system, kidneys, and other peripheral organs.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
GDNF has been linked to several crucial pathways and biological processes such as neuronal survival and differentiation, response to injury in the nervous system, and has therapeutic implications in neurodegenerative diseases and injury recovery. In diseases, GDNF is prominently associated with Parkinson’s disease due to its neuroprotective effects on dopaminergic neurons. The protein also has implications in renal diseases and its therapeutic potential has been explored in cancer, particularly in reducing side effects of chemotherapy drugs that cause nerve damage.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the field of pharmacogenetics, GDNF has been considered mainly for its potential therapeutic use rather than typical drug-gene interactions. GDNF gene therapy has been explored as a possible treatment for Parkinson’s disease, aiming to deliver the neurotrophic factor directly to the affected dopaminergic neuronal populations to halt or reverse disease progression. Moreover, GDNF’s role in enhancing the survival and repair of peripheral neurons has implications in mitigating chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in cancer treatment, particularly with agents known to cause nerve damage. Nevertheless, direct pharmacogenetic associations involving specific drugs are currently limited, and more research is required to establish well-defined drug-gene interaction profiles involving GDNF.
