## Gene Summary
IKBKE, short for Inhibitor of Nuclear Factor Kappa B Kinase Subunit Epsilon, is a kinase that plays a crucial role in regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is pivotal for immune response, inflammation, and cell survival. IKBKE is also involved in the type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathways. The gene is expressed in various tissues but shows higher expression in immune cells. Dysregulation of IKBKE has been implicated in several inflammatory responses and has been studied extensively for its role in oncogenesis, particularly in breast cancer.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The IKBKE gene is linked to a variety of diseases, especially those related to inflammatory and oncogenic processes. These include breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and prostate cancer, where its overexpression can lead to enhanced cell proliferation and survival. In inflammation, IKBKE is seen to play a role in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and potentially in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, though specific associations are still under investigation. The gene is also involved in critical signaling pathways including NF-κB activation and IFN signaling pathways, both of which are central to inflammatory and immune responses.

## Pharmacogenetics
From a pharmacogenetics standpoint, IKBKE variants may influence the response to several therapeutic agents, particularly those used in cancer treatment. For example, inhibitors targeting the NF-κB pathway, where IKBKE plays a critical role, might show varied efficacy depending on the specific genetic makeup of the IKBKE gene in individual patients. However, as of the current state of research, specific drugs with pharmacogenetic associations directly connected to IKBKE variants are not well-documented and require further investigation. This relationship highlights the potential for personalized approaches in treating diseases associated with IKBKE, contingent on deeper understanding and validation of its pharmacogenetic profile.
