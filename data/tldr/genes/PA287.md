## Gene Summary
PTGER2 is the official symbol for the Prostaglandin E Receptor 2 gene. It encodes a member of the G-protein coupled receptor family and mediates the physiological effects of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PTGER2 is involved in various processes including inflammation, immune response, and pain perception. The receptor is expressed in a variety of tissues, including the brain, gastrointestinal tract, and uterus, where it plays roles in inducing smooth muscle relaxation, vasodilation, and facilitating processes such as fever response and parturition.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
PTGER2 is implicated in multiple physiological pathways mainly revolving around the prostaglandin synthesis and response. It is important for the modulation of inflammatory responses as well as reproductive functions and plays a role in diseases characterized by inflammation such as arthritis and asthma. Abnormalities in the function or expression of PTGER2 have also been linked to dysmenorrhea and certain types of cancer due to the role of prostaglandin E2 in promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis. Research continues to explore PTGER2 as a potential pharmacological target in managing pain and inflammatory diseases.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic associations of PTGER2 primarily focus on its role in mediating the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are often used to manage pain and inflammation by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. The response to NSAIDs, and specifically those targeting prostaglandin pathways (like COX-2 inhibitors), may vary based on genetic differences in PTGER2 among individuals. Understanding individual variations in this gene could lead to personalized treatment strategies optimizing NSAID therapy. Studies are actively exploring these associations to enhance the efficacy and safety of such treatments in pain and inflammatory conditions.
