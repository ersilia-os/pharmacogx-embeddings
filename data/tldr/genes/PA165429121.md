## Gene Summary
SKOR2, or SKI family transcriptional corepressor 2, is a gene involved in the transcription regulation processes primarily through its role as a transcriptional corepressor. This gene is a member of the SKI family and plays a significant role in neural development and functions. Although it is not as widely studied in comparison to other more prominent genes, SKOR2 is recognized for its functional implications in nervous system development and has been observed in brain tissues suggesting its significant role in these tissues.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Currently, explicit associations of SKOR2 with specific drugs or diseases have not been thoroughly delineated in the literature. Additionally, its direct involvement in pathways related to typical pharmacological interventions tends to be limited or not yet discovered. The primary focus of research around SKOR2 pertains more to its role in developmental processes rather than disease correlations. Given its role in neural development, there may be indirect implications or future discoveries relating to neurological conditions and potentially linked to phenotypic variations influencing neural functionalities.

## Pharmacogenetics
As of the current scientific understanding, the pharmacogenetics of SKOR2 has not been extensively studied or documented. There are no prominent pharmacogenetic associations connecting SKOR2 with the efficacy or metabolism of specific drugs. The research in this domain might still be embryonic, thus most of the potential implications of SKOR2 in pharmacogenetics remain exploratory and theoretical. Future studies may uncover its implications in drug response, especially concerning neurological conditions where it could influence drug efficacy or side effects, but as of now, no direct connections have been made.
