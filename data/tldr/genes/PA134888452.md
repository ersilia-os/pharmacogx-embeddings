## Gene Summary
SV2C (Synaptic Vesicle Glycoprotein 2C) is one of the three known isoforms of the synaptic vesicle protein SV2, with SV2A and SV2B being the others. SV2C is involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release at synapses. It plays a crucial role in the function of synaptic vesicles and has been particularly noted for its expression in brain regions strongly associated with motor control, such as the basal ganglia and substantial nigra. SV2C affects the modulation and release of neurotransmitters, including dopamine, which is critical in pathways associated with motion and coordination.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Research has indicated a significant involvement of SV2C in neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, notably Parkinson's disease and possibly influencing phenotypes related to movement disorders. The gene's influence on dopamine pathways links it to the pathophysiology of these conditions. Additionally, SV2C might interact with various signaling pathways critical for neuronal function and survival, influencing disease progression in neurodegenerative diseases. Its role in synaptic neurotransmitter release also implicates it in epilepsy and potentially other neurological disorders.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of SV2C is an emerging field primarily focused on its relationship with dopamine regulatory drugs used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. There is growing interest in understanding how genetic variations in SV2C may affect the efficacy and safety of these medications, potentially contributing to personalized medicine approaches in neurology. Additionally, as SV2C is implicated in the modulation of neurotransmitter systems, variations in this gene might influence responses to several neuroactive drugs, including anticonvulsants and neuroprotective agents. Understanding these interactions could lead to improved therapeutic strategies tailored to genetic profiles, enhancing drug efficacy and reducing adverse effects in neurological treatment regimes.
