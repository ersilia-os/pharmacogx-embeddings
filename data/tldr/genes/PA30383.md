## Gene Summary
LILRB5, or leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily B member 5, is a gene that encodes an immunoreceptor expressed predominantly on the surfaces of certain immune cells, including monocytes and natural killer cells. This receptor is involved in the regulation of immune responses by recognizing and binding to various class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, acting generally as an inhibitory receptor that helps to maintain immune system balance. LILRB5’s expression and functional roles in immune modulation suggest its involvement in immune tolerance and possibly the regulation of inflammatory responses.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The expression and function of LILRB5 are linked to its role in several immune-related pathways, primarily involving the inhibition of cell activation via its interactions with MHC class I molecules. Through these interactions, it can potentially impact the pathogenesis of diseases where immune regulation and inflammation are disrupted, such as autoimmune diseases, some forms of cancer, and infectious diseases. Although specific diseases directly attributed to mutations or dysregulation of LILRB5 are not well-documented, the gene’s role in immune regulation suggests it could be significant in conditions involving immune system dysfunction.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, specific pharmacogenetic associations involving LILRB5 and therapeutic drugs are limited, indicating a gap in current research that could be explored further as our understanding of immune checkpoint pathways in disease treatment, particularly in cancer immunotherapy, evolves. However, knowing the gene's regulatory role on the immune response offers a theoretical basis for considering it a potential target in developing treatments for diseases where the immune system plays a critical role. Future pharmacogenetic studies might reveal how variations in LILRB5 could affect individual responses to treatments, especially in therapies aimed at modulating immune checkpoints or treating autoimmune disorders and cancer.
