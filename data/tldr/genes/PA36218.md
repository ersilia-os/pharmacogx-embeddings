## Gene Summary
CDKL5, or Cyclin-Dependent Kinase-Like 5, is a kinase gene primarily associated with the regulation of neuronal development and function. It encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in various signal transduction processes. CDKL5 is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in the cortex and hippocampus, areas critical for cognitive and emotional functionality. The protein has a key role in the phosphorylation of neuronal substrates affecting neuron structure and activity.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CDKL5 is closely associated with a rare X-linked genetic disorder known as CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder (CDD), formerly known as Atypical Rett Syndrome. This condition is characterized by early-onset, difficult-to-control seizures, severe neurodevelopmental impairment, and other neurological issues. Research has shown that mutations leading to loss of function or altered function of the CDKL5 enzyme are primarily responsible for CDD. The gene is also implicated in broader neurodevelopmental disorders, potentially influencing synaptic function and plasticity pathways that are crucial in cognitive functions.

## Pharmacogenetics
CDKL5â€™s pharmacogenetic profile is still largely under research with a focus primarily on understanding how mutations influence response to treatments in disorders like CDD. Patients with CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder often require personalized treatment strategies to manage seizures and neurodevelopmental symptoms, and research is ongoing to determine whether specific genetic variations in CDKL5 could predict responsiveness to certain antiepileptic drugs or neurodevelopmental therapeutics. For instance, drugs commonly used in the management of seizures in other epileptic disorders may have varying levels of efficacy in CDD, potentially influenced by the specific CDKL5 mutations.
