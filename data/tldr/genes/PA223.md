## Gene Summary
KCNQ1 is a gene that encodes the voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv7.1. It plays a crucial role in repolarizing the cardiac action potential and in regulating the transport in epithelial tissues. The protein encoded by KCNQ1 partners with different beta subunits to assemble into a potassium channel. These channels are critical in influencing the electrical excitability of the heart, making them essential in maintaining normal cardiac function. KCNQ1 is expressed predominantly in the heart, but is also found in other tissues like the kidney, intestine, and pancreas.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The dysfunction or mutations in the KCNQ1 gene are linked to several cardiac diseases, most notably Long QT Syndrome types 1 and 2 (LQT1 and LQT2), which are characterized by prolonged cardiac repolarization and a propensity to develop arrhythmias. Other associated conditions include familial atrial fibrillation and Short QT syndrome, emphasizing its importance in cardiac electrical activity. The pathways involving KCNQ1 include those related to cardiac signaling and electrolyte balancing across epithelial cells.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetics of KCNQ1 focuses mainly on its implications in drug efficacy and safety in conditions like arrhythmias. Drugs such as beta-blockers are standard treatments used in managing Long QT Syndrome, and knowing the KCNQ1 genotype can help tailor these therapies more effectively, minimizing risks like drug-induced arrhythmias. Moreover, KCNQ1 interactions with other drugs that extend QT intervals, such as certain antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics, and antibiotics, are crucial, as these interactions can significantly impact the managing plans for susceptible patients. Given its role in drug-induced arrhythmias, KCNQ1 pharmacogenetics aids in identifying risks and adjusting therapies to mitigate severe adverse effects.
