## Gene Summary
XRCC4, or X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 4, is a gene that plays a crucial role in the repair of double-strand breaks in DNA, specifically through the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. This process is vital for maintaining genomic stability and preventing mutations that could potentially lead to cancer. XRCC4 forms a complex with DNA ligase IV, which is essential for the ligation of DNA strands during repair. The gene is expressed in various tissues, but it is particularly important in proliferative cells where DNA damage repair is critical.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
XRCC4 is implicated in several pathways related to DNA repair and has been studied in the context of cancer, particularly in terms of its role in resistance to radiation therapy and certain chemotherapeutic agents. Mutations or deficiencies in XRCC4 can lead to increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents and are associated with various types of cancers, including lymphomas and carcinomas. XRCC4 deficiency has also been linked to developmental disorders and immunodeficiency due to its crucial role in V(D)J recombination, a process essential for the maturation of immune cells.

## Pharmacogenetics
From a pharmacogenetic standpoint, research into XRCC4 largely focuses on how variations in this gene might influence individual responses to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in cancer treatment. While specific drugs targeting XRCC4 are not commercially available, understanding its function and interaction with existing chemotherapeutic agents can influence therapeutic strategies. For instance, patients with altered XRCC4 function might exhibit different responses to DNA-damaging agents such as cisplatin and doxorubicin, suggesting potential utility in personalizing treatment plans based on XRCC4 status to optimize efficacy and minimize adverse effects.
