## Gene Summary
KDR (Kinase Insert Domain Receptor) is also commonly known as VEGFR-2 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2). This gene encodes a key receptor tyrosine kinase involved in the regulation of angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, and endothelial cell growth. KDR is activated principally by VEGF-A, which leads to a cascade of different signaling pathways affecting cell proliferation, migration, and survival. The expression of KDR is mainly localized to endothelial cells, playing a crucial role in the formation of the vascular system.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
KDR is significant in the context of cancer, where its function contributes to tumor angiogenesis facilitating tumor growth and metastasis. It is also relevant in age-related macular degeneration, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetic retinopathy, which are linked to pathological angiogenesis. Key signaling pathways involving KDR include the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway that promotes cell survival and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathways, critical for new blood vessel formation. KDR's involvement in these multiple pathways makes it a valuable pharmacological target for diseases characterized by abnormal angiogenesis.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, KDR variants have been shown to influence the response to specific anticancer drugs like sunitinib and sorafenib, which target multiple tyrosine kinases including KDR. Polymorphisms in KDR can alter drug efficacy and the adverse effect profile in cancer treatment, affecting individual patient's responses to therapy. These aspects make KDR a significant focus in personalized medicine, helping to tailor therapies that inhibit angiogenesis in a way that is most effective for the genetic profile of the individual patient. Knowledge of KDR pharmacogenetics is used to potentially improve outcomes in cancer therapy by optimizing drug selection and dosing.
