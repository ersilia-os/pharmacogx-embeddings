## Gene Summary
TXNDC11 (Thioredoxin Domain Containing 11) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the oxidative stress response, primarily by influencing protein folding through its thioredoxin domains. The protein is part of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein processing pathway, implicating it in the proper folding and functioning of other proteins. TXNDC11 is expressed in multiple tissues, indicating its fundamental role in maintaining cellular function under stress conditions.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Though specific drugs directly targeting TXNDC11 are not well-defined, the geneâ€™s association with the regulation of oxidative stress and ER stress responses links it indirectly to diseases involving these processes. Disorders such as diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and some cancers could be influenced by the dysfunction of this protein due to its role in managing cellular stress. Pathways involving TXNDC11 include those related to the unfolded protein response (UPR) and managing ER stress, critical in conditions where protein misfolding is a problem.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, the pharmacogenetics of TXNDC11 is not extensively documented. However, its involvement in oxidative stress and the ER stress response suggests that variability in this gene could influence the efficacy and toxicity of drugs used in diseases where oxidative or ER stress is a significant contributing factor. For example, in conditions like cancer or neurodegenerative diseases, where ER stress-modulating drugs are used, genetic variations in TXNDC11 might impact treatment outcomes. Further research is likely required to establish clear pharmacogenetic associations.
