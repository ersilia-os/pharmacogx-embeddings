## Gene Summary
IL18, also known as Interleukin 18, is a gene that encodes a proinflammatory cytokine which plays an important role in the immune response. IL18 is a member of the IL-1 superfamily of cytokines and is involved in inducing cell-mediated immunity following infection by microbial agents. The protein encoded by this gene is synthesized as an inactive precursor that is processed into an active form by caspase 1 (CASP1). This cytokine is known for its ability to induce interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³) production and enhance the toxicity of natural killer (NK) cells and certain T-cells. IL18 is expressed in various cell types including macrophages, dendritic cells, and epithelial cells, and its expression is upregulated in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs).

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
IL18 has been implicated in a variety of inflammatory responses and is associated with several immune-related diseases. Its dysregulation is linked to conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and certain types of cancer. The cytokine plays a significant role in Th1 type responses, often influencing the development of autoimmune diseases. In cancer, IL18 can be a double-edged sword; while it enhances immunity against tumors, it also promotes angiogenesis and metastasis in certain contexts. Pathway-wise, IL18 participates predominantly in the NF-kappa B signaling pathway and the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway, both of which play pivotal roles in immune system regulation and inflammation.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of IL18 involves understanding how genetic variation in this gene influences the response to drugs that target inflammatory pathways. There are no direct drugs targeting IL18 extensively used in clinical practice; however, its role in mediating immune and inflammatory responses makes it a potential therapeutic target in diseases like autoimmunity and cancer. Recent studies have shown interest in targeting IL18 as part of cancer immunotherapy strategies, considering its effects on enhancing NK cell activity and promoting T-helper cell response. In autoimmune diseases, modulators of IL18 activity might help in reducing inappropriate inflammatory responses. Since IL18 levels and activity can vary between individuals based on genetic makeup, pharmacogenetic approaches could personalize treatments in conditions where IL18 plays a critical role.
