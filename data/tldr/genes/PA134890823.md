## Gene Summary
PIK3R5, officially named phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 5, is a gene encoding a regulatory subunit in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) complex. PI3Ks are crucial in various cellular functions including growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, survival, and intracellular trafficking. PIK3R5 specifically participates in the PI3K gamma complex, which predominantly exerts its effects in the immune and circulatory systems. This subunit is essential for stabilizing the overall complex and modulating its activity towards particular signaling pathways, often in response to chemical signals from outside the cell.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
PIK3R5 is linked to the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which plays a significant role in processes such as glucose metabolism, apoptosis, cell proliferation, transcription, and cell migration. Abnormal PIK3R5 function or expression is implicated in immune system disorders and may contribute to inflammatory responses. Disorders associated with dysregulation of this pathway typically include cancers, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Given its role in signaling and immune response modulation, PIK3R5 might also influence susceptibility to infectious diseases and inflammatory conditions.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of PIK3R5 is still an emerging field, and detailed relationships between PIK3R5 gene variants and drug responses or adverse drug reactions are under investigation. However, due to its role in the PI3K/AKT pathway, PIK3R5 may have indirect implications in the efficacy of drugs targeting this pathway. PI3K inhibitors, such as idelalisib and copanlisib, which are used in cancer therapy, particularly in treating hematologic malignancies, might be influenced by the genetic variants in PIK3R5. Understanding individual differences in this gene could potentially impact the dosing, effectiveness, and safety of these PI3K-targeted therapies.
