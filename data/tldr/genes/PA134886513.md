## Gene Summary
MOB3B, officially known as MOB kinase activator 3B, is a gene implicated in the regulation of kinase activity within the cellular context, particularly through interactions with NDR family kinases. It plays a role in various cellular processes including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. The protein encoded by MOB3B is part of the MOB kinase activator family, characterized by their ability to bind and activate specific NDR kinases, which are critical for proper cell division and development. Expression of MOB3B is noted in various tissues, suggesting a broad functional role.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The detailed functions of MOB3B in relation to specific diseases or phenotypes have not been heavily characterized in the current scientific literature. However, as a part of signaling pathways involving NDR kinases, MOB3B could be indirectly involved in pathways regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and possibly oncogenesis. The dysregulation of kinase signaling pathways can contribute to the pathogenesis of various cancers and other diseases where cell cycle dysfunction is prevalent. Its role may be crucial in understanding cellular responses to environmental stresses that influence these pathways.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is limited specific information on pharmacogenetic associations involving MOB3B. Currently, no direct links between MOB3B and pharmacologic responses or adverse drug reactions have been documented extensively. Research into MOB3B may uncover ties to medication effects or interactions in kinase-targeted therapies, potentially utilized in cancer treatment. However, more studies are necessary to establish any pharmacogenetic relevance and the implications of MOB3B variants on drug efficacy and safety.
