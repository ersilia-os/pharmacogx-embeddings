## Gene Summary
KLRD1 (Killer Cell Lectin Like Receptor D1), commonly known as CD94, encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the immune system, specifically in the regulation of natural killer (NK) and T-cells. The encoded protein, along with its various ligands (such as NKG2A, NKG2C, and NKG2E), forms heterodimeric complexes that interact with the nonclassical MHC class I molecule, HLA-E. The interactions between KLRD1 and its ligands on target cells modulate NK cell activity, including cytotoxic responses and cytokine release, aiding in immune surveillance and the response to viral infections and tumors.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
KLRD1's involvement in immune regulation links it to a variety of diseases, particularly those associated with immune dysfunction such as autoimmune diseases, inflammatory conditions, and cancers. In cancer, the expression of KLRD1 can influence the effectiveness of immune surveillance against tumor cells. The geneâ€™s pathway interactions chiefly involve the Natural Killer Cell Mediated Cytotoxicity pathway. The functionality of KLRD1 in immune recognition also ties it to viral infection responses, where dysregulation can impact disease severity and progression.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of KLRD1 is predominantly relevant in the context of cancer immunotherapy and treatments targeting the immune response. Variants in KLRD1 may influence the efficacy of treatments that modulate NK cell activity, including therapies that utilize NK cell checkpoints or monoclonal antibodies designed to enhance anti-tumor immune responses. The study of KLRD1 as a pharmacogenetic target is emerging, focusing on how its polymorphisms affect drug response, particularly in the strategic design of immunomodulatory therapies in oncology. Understanding the genetic variations in KLRD1 and their impact on drug efficacy could significantly enhance personalized treatment approaches in immune-related disorders and cancer.
