## Gene Summary
CHRM3, or Cholinergic Receptor Muscarinic 3, is involved in mediating the physiological effects of acetylcholine, a prominent neurotransmitter, in the central and peripheral nervous system. It encodes for a G protein-coupled receptor that participates in a variety of intracellular signaling pathways and is essential in modulating functions such as enzyme secretion, ion channel conductance, and smooth muscle contraction. CHRM3 is prevalently expressed in various tissues including the brain, lungs, prostate, and urinary bladder.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CHRM3 is implicated in several critical cell signaling pathways associated with muscle contraction, glandular secretion, and other muscarinic acetylcholine receptor activities. Dysfunction or abnormal expression of CHRM3 is linked to diseases like asthma, where muscarinic receptors play a role in airway smooth muscle contraction. Additionally, CHRM3 has associations with bladder dysfunctions and various neurological disorders due to its significant role in smooth muscle activity and neuronal signaling. The receptor can be targeted pharmacologically by antimuscarinic drugs which aim to manage conditions involving hyperactive bladder and respiratory tract constriction.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, the CHRM3 gene holds importance due to its influence on the efficacy and response rate of several drugs, particularly in the management of respiratory and urinary system disorders. Antimuscarinic drugs such as tiotropium, which is used as a bronchodilator in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interact with CHRM3. Variations in CHRM3 can affect individual responses to these treatments, suggesting a potential area for personalized medicine targeting these pathways. Such genetic differences in CHRM3 may foretell the therapeutic outcomes of using antimuscarinic agents in conditions like asthma and overactive bladder, marking its significance in both clinical and pharmacogenetic landscapes.
