## Gene Summary
NNMT, or Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase, is an enzyme that catalyzes the N-methylation of nicotinamide and other pyridines, a reaction involved in the biotransformation of many drugs and xenobiotic compounds. NNMT is primarily expressed in the liver, but also present in other tissues including adipose tissue and kidney. This enzyme plays a role in the metabolism of nicotinamide, modulating its availability and consequently affecting pathways related to cell metabolism and energy balance. 

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NNMT has been associated with the metabolic regulation and is linked to several metabolic and cardiovascular disorders, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis. It is involved in various metabolic pathways, primarily affecting the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics through its methylation activity. Overexpression of NNMT has been observed in certain cancers, suggesting a role in tumor progression and resistance to chemotherapy. The enzyme also participates in the methylation pathway as part of the folate and homocysteine cycles.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetics studies have shown that NNMT's activity influences the efficacy and toxicity of several drugs, primarily due to its role in drug metabolism. Specifically, NNMT modulates the response to drugs such as 5-fluorouracil, commonly used in cancer therapy. Variations in the NNMT gene can lead to differences in drug metabolism rates among individuals, affecting both drug efficacy and the risk of adverse effects. In cancer therapy, higher NNMT expression is generally associated with increased resistance to certain chemotherapeutics. Research is ongoing to better understand how gene variations of NNMT could guide personalized treatment approaches, especially in metabolic disorders and chemotherapy management.
