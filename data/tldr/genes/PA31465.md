## Gene Summary
NCF4 (Neutrophil Cytosolic Factor 4) is a gene encoding a protein that is a component of the multi-protein complex known as NADPH oxidase. This complex plays a crucial role in the immune response by generating superoxide radicals to target pathogens. The protein encoded by NCF4 is specifically involved in the regulation of the oxidase activity, acting as an adaptor to bind to membrane-bound cytochromes through its src homology 3 (SH3) domains. NCF4 is highly expressed in neutrophils, but also found in a range of other immune cells including monocytes and macrophages.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NCF4 is critical for the proper functioning of the phagocytic NADPH oxidase complex, which is vital in the defense against bacterial and fungal infections. Mutations or dysfunctions in NCF4 have been associated with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a disorder characterized by severe recurrent infections and inflammatory complications. This gene is also implicated in autoinflammatory disorders due to its role in producing reactive oxygen species that can modulate inflammatory responses. Its pathways include phagosome function, Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, and signaling events mediated by the NADPH oxidase complex.

## Pharmacogenetics
While direct pharmacogenetic associations of NCF4 with specific drugs are not extensively documented, the geneâ€™s role in modulating immune and inflammatory responses provides a theoretical basis for influencing the efficacy or toxicity of drugs used in inflammatory diseases. Drugs targeting similar pathways, such as those used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases (e.g., corticosteroids, methotrexate) or in managing infectious diseases, could potentially be impacted by variations in NCF4 function. Additionally, understanding the genetic variations in NCF4 could help in optimizing therapies for diseases involving oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. However, specific drug-gene interactions and guidelines in pharmacogenetics related to NCF4 remain an area for further research and exploration.
