## Gene Summary
ASS1, or argininosuccinate synthase 1, is a crucial enzyme in the urea cycle, primarily responsible for the synthesis of argininosuccinate from citrulline and aspartate. This reaction plays a central role in the detoxification of ammonia and in the production of arginine, an important amino acid for protein synthesis and nitric oxide formation. ASS1 is expressed in various tissues but is most abundantly found in the liver and kidneys, which are key sites for urea cycle activity.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in the ASS1 gene are linked to a rare autosomal recessive disorder called citrullinemia type 1, characterized by high levels of citrulline and ammonia in the blood, often leading to severe neurological impairment if untreated. This condition manifests early in life, typically presenting with symptoms that include lethargy, seizures, and potentially life-threatening metabolic crises due to ammonia intoxication. ASS1's role in the urea cycle and nitric oxide synthesis pathways implicates it in broader metabolic and vascular processes, although primarily its clinical significance arises from its association with citrullinemia.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of ASS1 is primarily focused on the management of citrullinemia type 1 and involves treatment strategies that lower blood ammonia levels. Key treatments include the administration of nitrogen-scavenging drugs such as sodium benzoate or sodium phenylbutyrate, and dietary management to restrict proteins that can contribute to ammonia production. Arginine supplementation is also commonly employed to enhance the function of the residual urea cycle. The effectiveness and required dosage of these treatments can vary depending on the specific mutations present in the ASS1 gene, highlighting the importance of genetic insights in guiding therapeutic approaches. In broader clinical contexts, variations in ASS1 might also influence the efficacy and toxicity of drugs impacting the urea cycle or those metabolized by pathways involving arginine and nitric oxide, such as certain cardiovascular drugs, although such associations are less well defined in clinical pharmacogenetics.
