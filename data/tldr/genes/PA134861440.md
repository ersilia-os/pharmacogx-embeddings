## Gene Summary
DDHD1, or DDHD Domain Containing 1, is a gene that encodes an intracellular enzyme primarily involved in lipid metabolism. It acts as a phospholipase, specifically targeting phosphatidic acids to generate diglyceride and phosphatidylserine, which are crucial for the maintenance of cellular membrane integrity and signaling. DDHD1 is expressed in various tissues, with significant expression in the brain, suggesting a role in neural function and development.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
DDHD1 has been implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders. Mutations in this gene are associated with a rare form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG28), characterized by progressive weakness and stiffness of the legs. This association underscores its importance in neuronal structure and function. The metabolic pathways linked to DDHD1 involve lipid metabolism and signaling processes, essential for maintaining cellular membrane dynamics and functionality within the nervous system.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of DDHD1 is an emerging field, primarily due to its recent association with neurological conditions. While specific drugs targeting DDHD1 directly are not well-documented, understanding its role in lipid metabolism and neurodegeneration could be pivotal in developing therapeutic agents aimed at modulating its activity. Given the gene's involvement in lipid signaling pathways, any future pharmacological interventions could involve modulators of lipid metabolism that indirectly affect DDHD1 function or expression in the context of treating or managing neurological disease.
