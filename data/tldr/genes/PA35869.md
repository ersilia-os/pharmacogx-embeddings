## Gene Summary
SLC27A1, also known as Solute Carrier Family 27 Member 1, encodes a protein involved in the transport of long-chain fatty acids across the plasma membrane. This protein, primarily expressed in the liver and kidney, plays a crucial role in fatty acid metabolism by facilitating the uptake of exogenous fatty acids for subsequent beta-oxidation or re-esterification into lipid pools. SLC27A1 serves as a key facilitator in cellular energy management and lipid homeostasis.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SLC27A1's activity impacts various metabolic diseases and conditions related to dyslipidemia and fatty acid metabolism disorders. Dysregulation or genetic variations in this gene are associated with conditions like Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and insulin resistance. Additionally, its role in hepatic lipid metabolism ties it to broader metabolic pathways, including those influencing the metabolism of drugs that target lipid processing or are modified by lipid interactions.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, the relevance of SLC27A1 centers mainly on its influence in lipid metabolism and potential implications in the efficacy and metabolism of lipid-modulating therapies. Although direct associations between specific drugs and SLC27A1 genetic variations are not extensively documented, understanding its function aids in the broader context of predicting responses to lipid-associated therapies in metabolic disorders treatment. Studies continue to explore the impact of its genetic variants on drug responses in metabolic conditions.
