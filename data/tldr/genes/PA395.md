## Gene Summary
ABCC5 (ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily C Member 5) is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily, which are integral membrane proteins involved in the transport of various molecules across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. ABCC5 primarily acts as an efflux transporter, facilitating the movement of organic anions and drugs out of cells. It is ubiquitously expressed but shows higher expression levels in the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. The protein encoded by ABCC5 can influence cellular processes by modulating the concentration of signaling molecules and metabolites, impacting cellular signaling and metabolism.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ABCC5 is linked with the handling and resistance to multiple drugs, particularly in the context of cancer chemotherapy. It is shown to transport substrates such as cyclic nucleotides, which have a role in cellular signaling pathways, including those involved in phosphodiesterase inhibitors action. Diseases associated with ABCC5 include various types of cancer, where its expression can be related to a reduction in the effective intracellular accumulation of chemotherapeutic drugs, thus contributing to multi-drug resistance. Additionally, its role in modulating the transport of crucial metabolites and drugs may implicate it in neurological disorders and cardiovascular diseases.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the realm of pharmacogenetics, ABCC5 has been studied for its effects on the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of several drugs, particularly in cancer treatment. It has been associated with alterations in response to anti-cancer agents like methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, and thiopurines. Variants in ABCC5 can alter the transporter activity, potentially influencing the efflux and thus the bioavailability and toxicity of these drugs. Research indicates that certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ABCC5 may correlate with the survival outcomes and adverse effects profiles in patients treated with specific chemotherapeutic regimens. Given its role in drug transport, pharmacogenetic testing for variants in the ABCC5 gene may help to predict patient responses to certain medications and guide personalized medicine approaches in oncology.
