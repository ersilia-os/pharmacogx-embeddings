## Gene Summary
SLC13A2, also known as the solute carrier family 13 member 2, is a protein-coding gene that primarily functions in the transport of dicarboxylates and sulfate ions across the cell membrane. It is especially active in the kidneys and plays a critical role in the renal handling of citrate and succinate, substances essential for energy metabolism and detoxification processes. Expression studies have shown its presence in other tissues including the liver, placenta, and intestine, suggesting a somewhat broader role in whole-body homeostasis.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SLC13A2 is associated with the metabolic pathways involving citrate, an important intermediate in the citric acid cycle. The disruption of these pathways can lead to various metabolic disorders. Notably, mutations in SLC13A2 have been implicated in disorders related to renal citrate metabolism, possibly influencing the formation of kidney stones due to altered citrate reabsorption. The gene's influence on citrate levels also connects it indirectly to conditions like metabolic syndrome and diabetes, where citrate metabolism can be significantly disrupted.

## Pharmacogenetics
Although SLC13A2 is less well-known in pharmacogenetic contexts compared to other solute carriers, its role in drug excretion and metabolism is beginning to be appreciated. The transporter can influence the renal clearance of certain drugs that are structurally similar to its natural substrates (dicarboxylates). For example, medications that are excreted through or affect the citric acid cycle could potentially be impacted by variations in SLC13A2 functionality. However, specific drug interactions and pharmacogenetic implications are currently under-researched and not as well established as those seen with other members of the solute carrier family. More detailed studies are required to exploit its potential in personalized medicine fully.
