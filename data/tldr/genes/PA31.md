## Gene Summary
ADD1, or Adducin 1, is a gene that encodes for the alpha subunit of adducin, a heterodimeric protein that consists of related subunits (alpha, beta, gamma). Adducin is a cytoskeletal protein involved in maintaining the structural integrity of the cytoskeleton and plays a crucial role in the assembly of the spectrin-actin network in erythrocytes and at sites of cell-cell contact in epithelial tissues. ADD1 is ubiquitously expressed but shows higher expression in tissues such as the brain and kidneys. It regulates the formation of membrane protuberances, cell adhesion, and migration, which suggests its importance in cellular dynamics and signaling.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ADD1 has been studied in various contexts concerning physiological functions and disease associations. It is particularly noted for its role in hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. Variations in ADD1 have been linked to altered ion transport and homeostasis, particularly sodium handling in kidney cells, which influences blood pressure regulation. In the realm of diseases, ADD1 polymorphisms have been associated with hypertension, heart disorders, and possibly complications in metabolic syndrome. Regarding signaling pathways, ADD1 is involved in the RHOA signaling pathway, impacting actin cytoskeleton dynamics and therefore affecting various cellular functions such as morphology, motility, and adherence.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the pharmacogenetic context, the ADD1 gene is of interest primarily because of its association with hypertension and the response to antihypertensive drugs. For instance, variants within the ADD1 gene have been shown to modify the effectiveness and side effect profiles of diuretics, which are commonly used in the treatment of high blood pressure. Studies have shown that individuals with certain genotypes of ADD1 may respond better to specific diuretics like hydrochlorothiazide. This gene serves as a potential biomarker for personalizing treatment plans in hypertensive patients to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects. Research into ADD1's pharmacogenetic applications continues to evolve, holding promise for more individualized and effective approaches to managing hypertension and related cardiovascular conditions.
