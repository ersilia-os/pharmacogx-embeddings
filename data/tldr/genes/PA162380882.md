## Gene Summary
CADM2, or Cell Adhesion Molecule 2, encodes a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. These molecules are involved in a wide range of cellular processes including cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation. CADM2 is primarily expressed in the central nervous system and has been implicated in synapse assembly, synaptic transmission, and plasticity, playing a crucial role in the regulation of neuronal signaling. Its expression is not limited to the nervous system, as it also appears in other tissues, though to a lesser extent.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CADM2 has been associated with various neuropsychiatric and behavioral phenotypes. Research has linked variations in this gene with susceptibility to autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Furthermore, its involvement in cognitive functions such as memory and learning has also been studied. CADM2 influences several signaling pathways critical for neural development and function, including those involved in neuroplasticity and neurotransmitter regulation. Although not directly targeted by any specific drugs, CADM2's role in these diseases makes it a potential target for therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating synaptic function.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of CADM2 primarily relates to its influence on disease risk and phenotype rather than direct interactions with specific drugs. Nonetheless, understanding variations in CADM2 can be crucial for developing personalized medicine approaches, particularly in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders. By better understanding how genetic variations in CADM2 affect the development and progression of these disorders, researchers can potentially identify new therapeutic targets or adapt existing treatments to better suit individual genetic profiles. Although specific drug associations are currently limited, the gene's broad impact on neuronal functions suggests that future pharmacogenetic applications may emerge as more is learned about its role in disease.
