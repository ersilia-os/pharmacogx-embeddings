## Gene Summary
SLC7A5, also known as solute carrier family 7 member 5, is a gene that encodes the large neutral amino acids transporter small subunit 1 (LAT1). This protein functions as part of a heterodimeric amino acid transporter complex facilitating the transport of certain neutral amino acids, including essential amino acids like leucine, across cellular membranes in a sodium-independent manner. SLC7A5 is highly expressed in various tissues, particularly in the blood-brain barrier and in cancer cells, where it plays a crucial role in supplying amino acids necessary for rapid growth and development.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SLC7A5 is implicated in several diseases due to its role in amino acid transport, particularly in cancer, where it supports the high metabolic demands of rapidly proliferating cells. Its expression has been associated with the progression and poor prognosis of various cancers, including breast, lung, and brain tumors. SLC7A5 is also key in brain function, influencing neurotransmitter synthesis and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier. This gene is involved in multiple metabolic pathways including amino acid transport and metabolism, and it plays a role in mTOR signaling, a pathway critical for cell growth, proliferation, mobility, and survival.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of SLC7A5 includes its role in mediating the efficacy and toxicity of certain drugs, especially in the context of cancer treatment. One significant pharmacogenetic interaction is with the drug JPH203 (also known as KYT-0353), which is an inhibitor of SLC7A5 and is under investigation for the treatment of various cancers that express high levels of this transporter. The effectiveness of JPH203 and similar drugs can be influenced by variations in the SLC7A5 gene, affecting how different patients' tumors might respond to these therapies. By targeting SLC7A5, these drugs aim to starve cancer cells of the essential amino acids necessary for their growth, thus providing a targeted therapeutic strategy.
