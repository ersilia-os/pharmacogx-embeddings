## Gene Summary
CD33, or Cluster of Differentiation 33, is a transmembrane receptor expressed on cells of myeloid lineage, including monocytes and myeloid-derived dendritic cells. The gene encoding CD33 is located on chromosome 19q13.3. Functionally, CD33 is involved in modulating cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis of myeloid cells, primarily through its immune receptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs which recruit phosphatases upon ligand binding, thereby dampening cellular activation. Its role is notable in the immune response regulation and has implications in both normal and pathological conditions of the myeloid lineage.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CD33 has been extensively studied in the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) due to its selective expression on leukemic blasts in most AML subtypes. This gene has become a significant biomarker for diagnosis and a therapeutic target in AML. Its pathways primarily involve cell signaling mechanisms that regulate immune responses and cellular apoptotic processes. In pathological conditions, aberrant expression or function of CD33 has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, specifically Alzheimerâ€™s disease, because of its role in microglial function and modulation of inflammation in the brain.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, CD33 is crucial due to its involvement in targeted cancer therapy. The monoclonal antibody drug gemtuzumab ozogamicin targets CD33, making it a significant treatment option for AML. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is an antibody-drug conjugate where the antibody is directed against CD33 on the AML cells, linked to a cytotoxic agent that induces cell death upon internalization and drug release. However, response to this therapy can vary based on the genetic and epigenetic characteristics of CD33 expression in different subtypes of AML, influencing treatment efficacy and patient outcome. Therefore, understanding individual variations in the CD33 gene can be essential for optimizing therapeutic strategies involving CD33-targeted agents in leukemia treatment.
