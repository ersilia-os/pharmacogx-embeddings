## Gene Summary
ZNF613, also known as Zinc Finger Protein 613, is a gene located on chromosome 19q13.43. This gene encodes a member of the Kruppel family of zinc finger proteins, which are typically involved in DNA-binding and gene regulation. As a largely understudied gene, the specific functions of ZNF613 remain somewhat vague, though it is presumed to play a role in transcriptional regulation due to its zinc finger motif characteristic, which commonly mediates DNA-binding activities. The expression patterns and regulatory processes involving ZNF613 are not well-documented, reflecting a need for further investigation to elucidate its roles in physiological and pathological conditions.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Currently, there is limited information available about the direct involvement of ZNF613 in specific drugs, diseases, or pathways. No major associations have been established with particular phenotypes either. As a zinc finger protein, it may indirectly be linked to genetic regulatory mechanisms commonly found in multicellular organisms, implicating potential roles in cellular processes and developmental pathways. However, its precise function in disease manifestation or therapeutic targeting remains to be clearly defined due to the scarce data on this gene.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of ZNF613 have not been extensively explored, and there are no well-documented associations between ZNF613 and pharmacogenetic responses to drugs. Given the current knowledge gap, ZNF613 does not appear in common pharmacogenetic testing panels nor is it targeted by specific pharmacological interventions. Future research may uncover relevant interactions of ZNF613's gene product that could influence drug effects, possibly contributing to interindividual differences in drug metabolism, efficacy, or toxicity, but such information is presently unavailable.
