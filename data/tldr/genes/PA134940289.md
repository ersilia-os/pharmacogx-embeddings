## Gene Summary
HSD3B7, officially known as hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase, 3 beta- and steroid delta-isomerase 7, plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of bile acids, vital for the digestion and absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins in the intestines. This enzyme is involved in the early steps of the classical bile acid synthesis pathway which converts cholesterol to bile acids in the liver. The expression is predominantly hepatic, implicating its primary function in liver metabolism and health.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in HSD3B7 are associated with congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 1 (CBAS1), a rare genetic disorder that leads to a failure in producing normal bile acids, resulting in severe cholestasis. This can lead to liver damage and failure to thrive in affected individuals. The pathway regulated by HSD3B7 is pivotal for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis and the digestion and absorption processes in the gastrointestinal tract.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of HSD3B7 is particularly significant in the context of treating liver diseases and managing cholesterol levels. Since bile acid synthesis defects can lead to severe hepatopathy, therapeutic intervention with bile acids like cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid is common. Pharmacogenetic analysis helps determine the optimal types and dosages of such treatments, tailoring them according to the individual genetic makeup and predicting the therapeutic response and adverse effects. Such insights can significantly improve management strategies for conditions caused by or affecting bile acid synthesis and metabolism.
