## Gene Summary
HOXC13, or Homeobox C13, is part of the HOXC gene cluster on chromosome 12, a key player in the development and differentiation of cells and tissues. This gene encodes a transcription factor involved in the morphogenesis of hair, nails, and skin. It is crucial in the transcriptional regulation during the development of epithelial appendages, especially in the hair follicle cycle. Expression of HOXC13 is predominantly seen in tissues with extensive ectodermal interactions such as the hair follicles and nails, indicating its specialized role in integumentary system development.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
HOXC13 has been linked to several key biological pathways involving the development and differentiation of keratinocytes, elements vital for skin, hair, and nail health. Mutations or dysregulation in the expression of this gene are associated with hair and nail developmental disorders. Specifically, genetic variations in HOXC13 have been identified as underlying causes of pure hair and nail ectodermal dysplasia (PHNED), a rare genetic condition characterized by sparse hair and nail abnormalities. The gene plays a potential role in skin diseases and could influence the condition of skin cancers, although direct associations are less clearly defined.

## Pharmacogenetics
While direct pharmacogenetic associations involving HOXC13 and specific drugs are not extensively documented, the geneâ€™s significant role in skin and appendage development may impact the efficacy and outcomes of treatments targeting skin conditions or cancers. As a key regulator in the integumentary system, variations in HOXC13 could influence patient responses to therapies in dermatological applications, particularly those involving regenerative medicine or targeted gene therapy, though specific drugs modulating HOXC13 activity have yet to be characterized widely in pharmacogenetic contexts. This emphasizes the potential for future research into the gene-drug interactions concerning integumentary health and treatment.
