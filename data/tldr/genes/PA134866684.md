## Gene Summary
EPHA6, also known as Ephrin type-A receptor 6, is part of the Eph receptor family, which belongs to the protein-tyrosine kinase family of receptors. These receptors are integral to numerous developmental processes, primarily in the nervous system. EPHA6 is characterized by its interactions with cell-surface-bound ephrin ligands, leading to contact-dependent bidirectional signaling into neighboring cells. This receptor predominantly influences neuronal mapping and targeting in the developing brain but is also expressed in various adult tissues, albeit at lower levels.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Though not prominently linked to specific diseases, variations in EPHA6 have been associated with general impacts on neural development and functions, potentially influencing neurodevelopmental disorders indirectly. The gene's role is critical in axon guidance, a key component of neuronal development and regeneration, where it participates in pathways such as the ephrin receptor signaling pathway. The gene's expression and function might influence phenotypic traits related to cognitive and neural integrity.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there are limited direct associations between EPHA6 and specific pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs. However, given its role in neural development and connectivity, understanding variations in EPHA6 could contribute to better personalized approaches in treating neurological conditions. Drugs that influence ephrin signaling might indirectly affect the behavior of EPHA6, although concrete examples of such drugs and their pharmacogenetic interactions with EPHA6 are yet to be fully elucidated in clinical settings. This opens avenues for further research into how modifying EPHA6 activity could impact therapeutic outcomes in neurological disorders.
