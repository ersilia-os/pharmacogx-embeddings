## Gene Summary
CSNK1E, or Casein Kinase 1 Epsilon, is a gene encoding an enzyme belonging to the casein kinase 1 (CK1) family of serine/threonine kinases. This enzyme is involved in diverse cellular processes including membrane trafficking, circadian rhythm, cell cycle progression, and DNA repair. CSNK1E phosphorylates key proteins implicated in the regulation of these pathways, influencing their stability and activity. It is broadly expressed in many tissues, with significant roles in both the central nervous system and peripheral tissues.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The protein encoded by CSNK1E interacts with several key signaling pathways, notably the Wnt signaling pathway, which is critical for developmental processes. Abnormal CSNK1E activity has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, owing to its role in phosphorylating tau proteins. Variants of CSNK1E have also been linked to cancer development, mood disorders, and metabolic syndromes, reflecting its widespread influence on cellular health and behavior. Research indicates its involvement in circadian rhythm regulation, making it a potential target for sleep disorders.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, CSNK1E exerts influence primarily through its role in modifying drug metabolism pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target in treating diseases linked to its dysregulation. Although there are not many direct pharmacogenetic associations involving specific drugs, the enzyme's modulatory effect on key signaling and metabolic pathways suggests that its genetic variations could alter the efficacy and safety of drugs that rely on these pathways. In Alzheimer’s disease, for instance, modulators of CSNK1E activity could influence disease progression and patient response to therapy targeted at tau phosphorylation. Further investigation into the pharmacogenetics of CSNK1E could enhance personalized medicine approaches for diseases it affects.
