## Gene Summary
GGH, or gamma-glutamyl hydrolase, is an enzyme primarily involved in folate metabolism by catalyzing the hydrolysis of polyglutamate folate derivatives to monoglutamate forms, facilitating renal reabsorption and cellular uptake. It is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in the liver and kidneys. By regulating folate availability, GGH plays a crucial role in DNA synthesis and repair as well as cellular proliferation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
GGH is implicated in the action and efficacy of antifolate drugs commonly used in chemotherapy, such as methotrexate. The enzyme’s activity influences drug toxicity and therapeutic outcomes in diseases like cancer, especially in treatments involving malignant tumors, leukemia, and autoimmune disorders. Altered expression of GGH can also impact physiological phenotypes related to folate metabolism, influencing susceptibility to conditions like neural tube defects and other congenital malformations which are associated with folate pathways.

## Pharmacogenetics
The genetic variation of GGH has significant pharmacogenetic implications, particularly in the context of methotrexate treatment. Polymorphisms in the GGH gene can affect the enzyme's activity and thus the processing of methotrexate, impacting the drug’s potency and toxicity. For example, certain variants are associated with increased toxicity in cancer therapy, affecting dosing requirements and therapeutic outcomes. The study of GGH pharmacogenetics helps in tailoring individual doses to optimize efficacy and minimize adverse effects, aiding personalised medicine strategies in oncology and rheumatology.
