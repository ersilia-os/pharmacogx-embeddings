## Gene Summary
AS3MT, or Arsenite Methyltransferase, is an enzyme-coding gene primarily involved in the biotransformation of inorganic arsenic into methylated metabolites, which are generally considered less toxic. This gene is expressed in various human tissues, including the liver and kidney, where it plays a critical role in arsenic detoxification. AS3MT catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to arsenic, which is a key step in the metabolism and excretion of this potentially harmful element.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The activity and expression of AS3MT are significant in the context of diseases related to arsenic exposure, such as skin lesions, cardiovascular disease, and various cancers, particularly bladder, lung, and skin cancers. Genetic variations in AS3MT have been shown to influence individual differences in susceptibility to arsenic-induced diseases. Research has shown that methylated arsenicals produced by AS3MT activity can have different toxicological profiles, influencing the pathogenesis of these conditions. Pathways associated with AS3MT include not only arsenic metabolism but also broader aspects of xenobiotic metabolism.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, AS3MT is notable for its influence on the toxicity and therapeutic effects of drugs that alter arsenic metabolism or are arsenic-based. For instance, variations in the AS3MT gene can affect the efficacy and safety of arsenic trioxide, which is used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Certain allelic variations in AS3MT have been associated with differential methylation activity, thereby influencing arsenic trioxide metabolism and therapeutic outcomes in APL treatment. Studies emphasize the potential of personalized medicine approaches that consider AS3MT genotype to optimize arsenic trioxide therapy, particularly by adjusting doses to improve efficacy while minimizing toxicity in individual patients.
