## Gene Summary
ECT2L, also known as epithelial cell transforming sequence 2 oncogene-like, is a gene involved in various cellular processes. Although less characterized compared to its counterpart ECT2, ECT2L plays roles in cytokinesis, the final step in cell division where the cytoplasm is divided between two daughter cells. Like ECT2, ECT2L is believed to function in the regulation of the cytoskeleton and act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), specifically affecting Rho/Rac family GTPases, prominent in reorganizing the actin cytoskeleton. The expression of ECT2L is prevalent in various tissues but most significant in proliferative cells which underscores its potential role in cell division and growth.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Research implicates ECT2L in the regulation of pathways involved in cell morphogenesis and division. Its interaction with molecular components of the mitotic apparatus suggests a substantial function in mitosis and cytokinesis. Current studies do not extensively connect ECT2L to specific diseases directly; however, owing to its functional similarities and interactions with ECT2, it could be implicated in cancer biology, especially in the context of cell overproliferation and tumor genesis. Understanding of ECT2L’s specific molecular pathways and interactions remains under investigation, which might later reveal more substantial connections to particular phenotypes or diseases.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of ECT2L are currently limited. There is no substantial evidence directly linking ECT2L with responses to specific pharmacological agents. However, given its potential role in cell cycle regulation, future research might explore the gene’s influence on the efficacy or toxicity of anticancer drugs, potentially those targeting the cell division machinery. Since ECT2, a closely related gene, has been studied in the context of cancer, drugs targeting mechanisms influenced by these genes may inadvertently affect pathways modulated by ECT2L. Thus, it remains a gene of interest for future pharmacogenetic research, particularly in oncology.
