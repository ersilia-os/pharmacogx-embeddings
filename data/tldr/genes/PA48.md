## Gene Summary
ALOX15, or arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase, is a member of the lipoxygenase family of enzymes, which principally catalyze the dioxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in lipids. ALOX15 specifically metabolizes arachidonic acid predominantly to 15S-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15S-HpETE), which is further metabolized to various bioactive lipids. It is expressed in a variety of tissues, including leukocytes, lung, and brain. This enzyme plays essential roles in the inflammatory response and regulation of cellular growth and differentiation. Variants of ALOX15 have also been implicated in lipid metabolism and inflammation-related disorders.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ALOX15 influences multiple biological pathways, particularly those involved with inflammation and immune system regulation. It is crucial in the synthesis of leukotrienes and lipoxins, which have various roles in inflammation and resolution processes. Conditions such as asthma, atherosclerosis, and other inflammatory diseases have demonstrated links to ALOX15 activity due to its role in immune-modulatory lipid mediator synthesis. BMI and metabolic syndrome display associations with variations in the expression and activity of ALOX15, affecting lipid metabolism pathways and disease phenotypes. Studies have correlated certain polymorphisms in ALOX15 with differences in susceptibility to diabetes and heart disease.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, ALOX15 is of interest because its modulation affects a wide array of inflammatory markers and pathways which are key targets in treating diseases like asthma and arthritis. While there are currently no drugs that specifically target ALOX15, understanding its pharmacogenetic impact may lead to better use of existing medications that affect lipoxygenase pathways indirectly, such as corticosteroids used in asthma or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) used in various inflammatory conditions. Closer exploration of ALOX15's involvement in drug efficacy and side effect profiles, especially in anti-inflammatory therapies, may offer a more tailored therapeutic strategy based on individual ALOX15 genotypes.
