## Gene Summary
HNMT, or histamine N-methyltransferase, is an enzyme encoded by the HNMT gene in humans. It is primarily involved in the metabolism of histamine, playing a crucial role in the inactivation of this biologically active amine by methylation. HNMT is predominantly expressed in the liver and kidneys, but it is also present in various other tissues, such as the central nervous system. The activity of this enzyme is important for regulating histamine levels throughout the body and thereby modulating immune responses, gastric acid secretion, and neuronal signaling.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
HNMT influences several physiological and pathological processes through its role in histamine metabolism. Abnormalities in HNMT expression or activity are associated with a variety of conditions, including allergies, asthma, and other histamine-related disorders. The enzymatic pathway primarily involves the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to histamine, producing N-methylhistamine, which is less biologically active. This pathway is crucial for maintaining homeostasis of histamine levels, which, if imbalanced, can contribute to allergic reactions and inflammatory responses.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of HNMT is particularly relevant in the context of allergy and asthma treatments. Polymorphisms in the HNMT gene can significantly influence the enzyme's activity and thereby affect individual responses to antihistamines. For instance, a common HNMT polymorphism, Thr105Ile (rs1801105), has been associated with altered enzyme activity and different clinical responses to drugs like diphenhydramine and other HNMT inhibitors. This genetic variation underscores the importance of considering HNMT activity in personalized medicine strategies, particularly in the management of histamine-mediated conditions. Understanding an individualâ€™s HNMT genotype can help in tailoring pharmacological interventions that more effectively manage symptoms related to abnormal histamine metabolism.
