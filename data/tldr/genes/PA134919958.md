## Gene Summary
UNC13D (Unc-13 Homolog D) is a gene which is crucial for the proper functioning of cytolytic granules in cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs and NK cells). It encodes a protein that is involved in priming these granules for fusion with the cell membrane prior to the targeted killing of cells, such as virus-infected or tumor cells. This gene is expressed prominently in hematopoietic tissues but can also be found in a variety of other tissues. UNC13D plays an essential role in the immune system's response to pathogens and malignantly transformed cells by enabling the exocytosis of cytotoxic granules.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
UNC13D has been predominantly linked to familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 3 (FHL3), a severe immune disorder characterized by uncontrolled activation of the immune system. This condition can lead to fever, cytopenias, hepatosplenomegaly, and neurological manifestations. Defects or mutations in UNC13D disrupt the normal function of cytolytic cells leading to the accumulation of these cells and excessive immune activation. This gene is also implicated in pathways relevant to vesicle-mediated transport and the regulation of exocytosis specially related to the immune response.

## Pharmacogenetics
The genetic variations in UNC13D are mainly of clinical significance concerning genetic predisposition to diseases rather than in pharmacogenetics in the classical sense of drug response. However, understanding these genetic variations can be crucial in managing diseases like FHL3, where bone marrow transplantation might be necessary, and exact genetic diagnosis can help guide treatment decisions. No direct associations with specific drugs are currently well-documented, but research into genetic variants of UNC13D might influence future therapeutic strategies, including potential gene therapy, for conditions like FHL3.
