## Gene Summary
PARP14 (Poly [ADP-ribose] Polymerase Family Member 14) is a multifunctional enzyme involved in various cellular processes including metabolism, gene regulation, and the response to environmental stress. This gene belongs to the PARP family, members of which are characterized by their enzymatic activity in poly-ADP-ribosylation, a post-translational modification of proteins. PARP14 is distinguished by its macro domains, which interact with ADP-ribose, and has been implicated in the regulation of transcription through modifying chromatin structure and recruitment of transcription factors. It is expressed in many tissues, with high levels in the spleen, thymus, and immune cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
PARP14 plays a role in several crucial signaling pathways, particularly in the regulation of inflammation and the immune response. The gene is implicated in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, influencing processes such as cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, making it relevant in both inflammatory diseases and cancer. Up-regulation of PARP14 has been observed in some cancers, suggesting a possible role in tumorigenesis. Additionally, its involvement in immune cell function links PARP14 to autoimmune conditions and inflammatory responses.

## Pharmacogenetics
Research into the pharmacogenetics of PARP14 is emerging, primarily focusing on its role in cancer and immune-related disorders. Given its role in DNA damage repair and cellular stress responses, PARP14 is a potential target for PARP inhibitors, which are already in use or in development for various cancers. For example, drugs like olaparib and rucaparib are PARP inhibitors that might interact with mechanisms influenced by PARP14. Pharmacogenetic studies could potentially reveal variations in the PARP14 gene that may predict responses to these treatments. Understanding individual differences in the function or expression of PARP14 due to genetic variation could lead to more personalized approaches in treating diseases associated with this gene.
