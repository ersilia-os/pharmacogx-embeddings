## Gene Summary
PARP11 (Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 11) is a member of the PARP family of proteins, which are known for their role in various cellular processes including DNA repair, genomic stability, and programmed cell death. PARP11 is characterized by its ability to modify proteins through the addition of ADP-ribose polymers, a post-translational modification known as poly-ADP-ribosylation. This enzyme is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues but shows a relatively higher expression in the testis and spleen. The specific cellular functions of PARP11 are less understood compared to other PARPs, but it is implicated in the regulation of cellular stress responses and immune signaling.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
PARP11's involvement in cellular pathways is linked primarily to its role in immune system regulation and the cellular stress response. Alterations in the function of PARP11 can potentially influence immune cell function and inflammatory responses. Although specific diseases directly attributed to PARP11 mutations or dysregulations are not widely documented, its role in crucial cellular processes suggests a potential indirect involvement in a broader spectrum of conditions, possibly including autoimmune disorders or cancer. The gene participates in broader PARP-related pathways, which are targets for cancer therapy compounds aiming at inhibiting PARP activity for managing tumor growth and enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, PARP11 has not been studied as extensively as other PARP family members like PARP1 and PARP2, which are well-recognized targets in cancer therapy (e.g., Olaparib and Rucaparib). However, the evolutionary conservation and functional roles of PARP11 suggest that it might influence the efficacy or toxicity of PARP inhibitors, although specific drug interactions or genetic variants influencing drug response involving PARP11 are yet to be clearly identified and characterized. As research in this area progresses, it may reveal significant pharmacogenetic associations that could be critical for personalized medicine applications, especially in the context of cancer therapy where PARP inhibitors are prominent. Further studies are needed to establish definitive pharmacogenetic profiles for PARP11.
