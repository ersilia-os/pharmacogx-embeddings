## Gene Summary
ZDHHC3, also known as zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 3, is a member of the DHHC protein family, characterized by a conserved DHHC cysteine-rich domain. ZDHHC3 primarily functions as a palmitoyltransferase, an enzyme that catalyzes the addition of palmitate, a type of fatty acid, to other proteins. This post-translational modification, known as palmitoylation, plays a crucial role in modulating the targeting and function of proteins within cell membranes. ZDHHC3 is broadly expressed in various human tissues, influencing various cellular processes including signal transduction and membrane trafficking.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ZDHHC3 has been implicated in several cellular pathways related to protein trafficking, membrane localization, and signal transduction. The enzymeâ€™s activity affects the function and localization of a variety of signaling proteins, thereby influencing pathways that regulate cell growth and apoptosis. While direct associations with specific diseases are limited in current literature, disruptions in protein palmitoylation, potentially influenced by ZDHHC3 dysfunction, are linked to broader cellular dysfunctions such as cancer development and neurological disorders. 

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic implications of ZDHHC3 are primarily theoretical at this stage but could be significant, considering the enzyme's role in the regulation of protein localization and function through palmitoylation. Drugs targeting signaling pathways, particularly in cancer and neurological disorders, might be affected by variations or alterations in the ZDHHC3 gene expression or function. However, specific drugs directly linked to ZDHHC3 in pharmacogenetic associations are not well-documented, making this an area ripe for further research. The understanding of ZDHHC3's pharmacogenetics could help in tailoring therapeutic strategies that consider individual genetic variations influencing protein palmitoylation processes.
