## Gene Summary
AMACR (alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase) is a gene that encodes an enzyme pivotal in the metabolism of branched-chain fatty acids and bile acid intermediates. AMACR alters the configuration of the R- and S-enantiomers of alpha-methyl-branched-chain fatty acyl-CoAs, which are important for the beta-oxidation pathway. The enzyme is highly expressed in the liver, kidneys, and various other human tissues. AMACR is involved in the metabolization of dietary fatty acids and pharmaceutical compounds, playing a critical role in lipid homeostasis.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
AMACR is significant in medical research due to its association with several diseases. Most notably, it is implicated in the pathology of prostate cancer, wherein its overexpression has often been noted. Additionally, deficiencies in AMACR are linked to a rare metabolic disorder known as alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase deficiency, which can lead to neurological deficits and an accumulation of pristanic acid. In terms of pathways, AMACR is involved in peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation, and dysregulation can affect lipid metabolism, influencing various metabolic disorders.

## Pharmacogenetics
AMACRâ€™s role in pharmacogenetics centers primarily on its metabolizing capability, which can influence the efficacy and toxicity of specific drugs, especially those that undergo fatty acid-like metabolism. Although specific drugs metabolized by AMACR are not well-documented, knowledge of its enzymatic activity suggests potential implications in drug metabolism pathways where branched fatty acids are involved. Understanding its pharmacogenetic profile can aid in optimizing drug dosing and reducing adverse drug reactions, particularly in treatments involving lipid-modifying therapies. Further research on its pharmacogenetic associations is essential for better clinical applications.
