## Gene Summary
F13A1, or coagulation factor XIII A chain, is a gene that codes for one subunit of the Factor XIII protein, a key protein in the blood coagulation system. Factor XIII is a transglutaminase enzyme that cross-links fibrin and stabilizes blood clots, which is essential for proper wound healing. The F13A1 gene produces the A subunit, which combines with the B subunit (encoded by the F13B gene) to form the active enzyme. This gene is expressed mainly in platelets and the placenta but is also present in a variety of tissues throughout the body at lower levels.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in the F13A1 gene can lead to blood clotting disorders, typically categorized under Factor XIII deficiency, a rare genetic disorder characterized by a lifelong tendency for bleeding and poor wound healing. This condition can manifest in various symptoms ranging from mild to severe bleeding episodes after surgery or injury. Factor XIII deficiency is often treated using blood transfusions and specifically Factor XIII concentrates. There are also known associations between variations in this gene and increased risk of thrombosis, where blood clots form inappropriately within blood vessels.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of F13A1 primarily involves its role in modulating responses to treatments in patients with factor XIII deficiency or other related coagulopathies. For instance, Factor XIII concentrate derived from plasma or recombinant sources is used in patients lacking sufficient functional protein due to mutations in the F13A1 gene. Understanding the genetic makeup of an individualâ€™s F13A1 can help in accurately dosing these products and potentially in anticipating adverse reactions. Though direct associations with standard anticoagulant or thrombolytic drug therapies (e.g., warfarin, heparin) are not clearly established in terms of response based on F13A1 genetic variations, the gene's central role in clot formation can provide insights into broader coagulation disorder treatments.
