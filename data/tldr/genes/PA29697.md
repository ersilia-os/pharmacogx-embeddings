## Gene Summary
**IGF1** stands for Insulin-like Growth Factor 1. It is a gene primarily involved in mediating growth and development processes in the human body. IGF1 encodes a hormone similar in molecular structure to insulin and plays a crucial role in childhood growth and continues to have anabolic effects in adults. The protein encoded by IGF1 is predominantly produced in the liver and acts by inducing cell growth and proliferation. Its activity is regulated largely by growth hormone (GH) from the pituitary gland, and it carries out its effects by binding to the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) which triggers intracellular signaling pathways.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
**IGF1** is implicated in several developmental and growth-related disorders. Abnormal levels of IGF1 are linked to growth disorders; low levels may lead to growth hormone insensitivity or dwarfism, whereas high levels can cause gigantism or acromegaly in the context of excessive pituitary release of GH. The gene's product is associated with a number of critical pathways including those involved in longevity, cell cycle control, and cellular senescence. Furthermore, IGF1 has been intricately associated with stem cell regeneration and repair imparting a critical component of wound healing and cellular replacement.

## Pharmacogenetics
In terms of pharmacogenetics, **IGF1** displays variability that can influence therapeutic outcomes particularly in treatments concerning growth disorders. Several drugs, especially growth hormone therapy, significantly interact with IGF1's expression or function to manage conditions like growth hormone deficiency, Turner syndrome, and non-growth hormone-deficient short stature. The effectiveness and safety of such treatments can vary depending on individual gene variations potentially affecting IGF-1 levels. Given its role in anabolic processes, there's ongoing research into how variations in the IGF1 gene may also impact the effectiveness and side effects of cancer treatments, as the IGF1 signaling pathway is closely linked to cellular proliferation and anti-apoptotic mechanisms.
