## Gene Summary
GSTCD, or Glutathione S-Transferase C-Terminal Domain Containing, is a gene located on chromosome 4. It encodes a protein that is believed to be involved in glutathione metabolism, similar to other members of the glutathione S-transferase family. This family of enzymes plays a critical role in detoxifying xenobiotics, products of oxidative stress, and in metabolizing drugs. The expression of GSTCD is not as well characterized as other members of the glutathione S-transferase family, but evidence suggests it may have specific tissue or condition-dependent expression patterns, potentially influencing various biological processes and disease states.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The biological pathways involving GSTCD are predominantly associated with the metabolism and detoxification of compounds through conjugation with glutathione. While direct associations with specific diseases are not extensively detailed, indirect involvement through its enzymatic activities suggests a possible influence on conditions where detoxification processes are compromised. Diseases influenced by oxidative stress and inflammation could see potential impact influenced by variations or dysfunction in this gene. However, precise roles in specific conditions require further research.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, the pharmacogenetics of GSTCD is not well defined. Unlike more commonly studied glutathione S-transferases like GSTP1 and GSTM1, GSTCD has not been extensively linked to specific drug response variations or adverse drug reactions. Its role in the metabolism of medications, potentially through conjugation reactions, suggests that there could be pharmacogenetic implications that are yet to be discovered or adequately studied. Thus, while it may play a role similar to other GSTs in influencing drug metabolism and response, specific drugs that are impacted by GSTCD variations are not well documented at this time. This area remains open for further discovery and clarification in pharmacogenomic research.
