## Gene Summary
ITGB3, or Integrin Subunit Beta 3, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the integrin beta chain family. Integrins are integral cell-surface proteins composed of an alpha chain and a beta chain, and they mediate cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. This protein is a receptor for fibronectin, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, vitronectin, and thrombospondin. It is primarily expressed in platelets and is crucial in the process of platelet aggregation, a key step in the formation of thrombi and hemostasis. Additionally, it is involved in various cellular processes including coagulation, wound healing, and tumor progression.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ITGB3 is majorly linked to diseases related to platelet aggregation and blood coagulation, such as Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, a rare genetic disorder characterized by bruising and a propensity to bleed. Altered ITGB3 function influences phenotypes associated with thrombosis and other cardiovascular conditions. Moreover, because of its role in cellular migration and proliferation, ITGB3 is also implicated in the progression of various cancers. The pathways related to ITGB3 include those focused on platelet activation, signaling, and aggregation, along with pathways mediating cell adhesion and the immune response. 

## Pharmacogenetics
From a pharmacogenetic viewpoint, ITGB3 has implications in the efficacy and safety of certain drugs, particularly those used in the management of thrombosis and other cardiovascular diseases. Notably, the platelet aggregation inhibitor clopidogrel has a well-established interaction with this gene. Variations in ITGB3 can affect the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel, thus impacting clinical outcomes such as susceptibility to cardiovascular events post-treatment. These genetic variations can guide the dosing and choice of antiplatelet therapy in treating cardiovascular conditions, ensuring personalized and more effective therapy management.
