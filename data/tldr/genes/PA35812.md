## Gene Summary
SLC15A2, also known as the solute carrier family 15 member 2, is primarily recognized for its role as a peptide transporter. It specifically functions as an H+/peptide symporter that facilitates the renal reabsorption and intestinal absorption of peptides by cotransporting a proton with dipeptides or tripeptides. This gene is crucial for the efficient use of dietary protein and peptide-based drugs. SLC15A2 is predominantly expressed in the kidney and to a lesser extent in the small intestine, which corresponds with its role in renal and gastrointestinal peptide handling.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The functionality of SLC15A2 has implications in various clinical contexts due to its essential role in transporting peptide-based substances. Abnormalities or variations in this transporter can influence the pharmacokinetics of several peptide-like drugs and could potentially contribute to various renal and gastrointestinal disorders. In the realm of metabolic pathways, SLC15A2 is pivotal in the renal handling pathway, facilitating the absorption and disposition of nutrients and medications.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, SLC15A2 is of particular interest because it is involved in the transport of several clinically important drugs, although it is less commonly studied compared to its relative SLC15A1. Known interactions include drugs such as Î²-lactam antibiotics, which are structurally similar to peptides and depend on efficient renal clearance mechanisms involving peptide transporters like SLC15A2. Genetic variants of SLC15A2 can affect the transport efficiency and could potentially lead to altered drug levels in serum and tissues, influencing both efficacy and toxicity of these drugs. Studies focusing on pharmacogenetic associations specifically addressing drug response variations and adverse effects due to SLC15A2 variances are still emerging, highlighting a need for deeper investigation in diverse populations.
