## Gene Summary
ALOX5, or arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase, is an enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes from arachidonic acid. These leukotrienes are involved in inflammatory and allergic responses. The gene is primarily expressed in leukocytes, including neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and macrophages, which are key players in the inflammatory pathway. ALOX5 functions in the conversion of arachidonic acid to 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE) and subsequently to various leukotrienes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ALOX5 is implicated in several inflammatory diseases such as asthma, rhinitis, and other allergic conditions. The pathways involving this gene are primarily related to leukotriene synthesis crucial for immune system signaling and inflammation. Dysregulation or mutation of ALOX5 has also been linked to enhanced susceptibility to conditions like atherosclerosis and different forms of cancer due to its role in inflammation-related pathways. Drugs targeting ALOX5 generally aim to modulate its enzymatic activity to control excessive inflammatory responses in such diseases.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of ALOX5 is particularly relevant in the context of drug responses in inflammatory diseases. Variants within the ALOX5 gene can influence the efficacy and safety of leukotriene modifiers, which are used predominantly in the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis. For example, the presence of certain polymorphisms in the ALOX5 promoter region is associated with a differential response to antileukotriene drugs such as montelukast and zileuton. Patients with specific genetic variants may experience less benefit from these medications, which can guide personalized treatment plans in clinical settings to optimize therapeutic outcomes.
