## Gene Summary
GSTK1, or Glutathione S-transferase kappa 1, is part of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family, which plays a crucial role in cellular detoxification. The gene encodes a protein involved in the catalysis of the conjugation of reduced glutathione to a variety of substrates. This process is vital for the detoxification of endogenous compounds such as peroxidized lipids, and maintenance of cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms. GSTK1 is widely expressed in various tissues, including liver and kidney, and is located in the mitochondria and peroxisomes, highlighting its role in the protection against oxidative stress.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
GSTK1 is implicated in multiple biological pathways primarily involving the metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 and the glutathione metabolism pathway. These pathways are crucial for the bodyâ€™s response to toxic environmental substances and drugs. Variations in this gene might influence individual susceptibility to conditions where detoxification processes are compromised or overwhelmed. Studies have suggested that polymorphisms in GSTK1 could be linked with different outcomes in diseases like cancer, where oxidative stress is a significant factor. However, direct associations with specific diseases are still under investigation.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, GSTK1's role is crucial in understanding individual differences in drug metabolism and response, especially concerning drugs that are substrates for glutathione conjugation. Although specific drug interactions and pharmacogenetic implications of GSTK1 are not as well-characterized as those of other GST family members like GSTM1 or GSTP1, the gene's involvement in detoxification suggests it could potentially influence the efficacy and toxicity of a broad range of drugs. Further research is needed to elucidate specific pharmacogenetic associations and could lead to more personalized approaches in medicine, particularly for drugs that are heavily reliant on glutathione pathways for metabolism and clearance.
