## Gene Summary
PROC, or protein C, is a critical anticoagulant protein encoded by the PROC gene located on chromosome 2. Protein C is synthesized in the liver as a precursor, which is then converted into its active form by thrombin in circulation. Active protein C functions primarily as a serine protease with anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective activities. By inhibiting factors Va and VIIIa, active protein C effectively regulates blood clot formation and prevents excessive coagulation. Its activity is enhanced by protein S, another vitamin K-dependent plasma protein.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Protein C deficiency, owing to variations in the PROC gene, results in an increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE). The conditions associated with PROC mutations may manifest as either congenital protein C deficiency, which can be a severe disorder in its homozygous form leading to life-threatening purpura fulminans in newborns, or a milder inherited predisposition to venous thrombosis in adults. Protein C is part of the protein C anticoagulant pathway, which plays a fundamental role in controlling thrombin formation and thus maintaining blood flow and preventing clotting disorders. Clinical management often includes the administration of protein C concentrates in severe cases of deficiency.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of the PROC gene is primarily concerned with its impact on the treatment and management of thrombotic disorders. Individuals with protein C deficiency may require tailored anticoagulant therapy. Warfarin, a commonly used anticoagulant, requires careful management in patients with protein C deficiency as it can reduce protein C levels and may paradoxically increase the risk of clotting initially in the treatment process, known as "warfarin-induced skin necrosis." Genetic testing for PROC variants can be crucial in predicting warfarin sensitivity and guiding dosage to minimize complications. Additionally, understanding individual genetic variations in PROC can help in determining the baseline risk for thrombotic events and the likely benefit from protein C replacement therapies.
