## Gene Summary
CES1, or Carboxylesterase 1, is primarily expressed in the liver and is involved in the metabolism of various xenobiotics and endogenous substrates. This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of ester and amide bonds of drugs such as procaine and cocaine, as well as various lipid-soluble compounds. CES1 plays a significant role in drug metabolism, particularly in the hydrolysis of ester prodrugs into active metabolites. The gene's expression and function can vary significantly among individuals, impacting both drug efficacy and toxicity.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CES1 is associated with the metabolism of several clinically important drugs. It is also implicated in disorders related to metabolism such as dyslipidemias and obesity. CES1's role in drug metabolism places it within several key biochemical pathways, including those involved in drug metabolism and lipid metabolism. Dysregulation or genetic variants of CES1 can alter drug levels and effects, potentially leading to drug toxicity or therapeutic failure. Additionally, it may be involved in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases through its role in lipid metabolism.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of CES1 is crucial in understanding variations in drug responses among individuals. Genetic polymorphisms within CES1 can significantly affect the metabolism of certain drugs, influencing their efficacy and safety. Notable examples include the anticoagulant drug clopidogrel and the ADHD medication methylphenidate. Variants of CES1 have been shown to alter the hydrolysis rate of clopidogrel's active metabolite, thus impacting its antiplatelet effect and influencing the risk of cardiovascular events. Similarly, variations in CES1 can affect the metabolism of methylphenidate, potentially altering its therapeutic outcomes and side-effect profile. Understanding these pharmacogenetic associations is essential for optimizing drug dosing and minimizing adverse effects.
