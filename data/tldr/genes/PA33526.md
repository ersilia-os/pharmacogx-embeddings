## Gene Summary
POMC, or Proopiomelanocortin, is a precursor polypeptide with several biologically active cleavage products. These products include adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), melanocyte-stimulating hormones (MSH alpha, beta, and gamma), and beta-endorphin, which are involved in a wide range of physiological functions. POMC is primarily expressed in the pituitary gland, with additional expression noted in other tissues, including the skin, immune cells, and peripheral nerves. It plays a crucial role in many biological functions such as stress response, immune responses, and energy homeostasis.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The cleavage products of POMC are implicated in various physiological pathways and conditions. ACTH, for instance, is essential in the regulation of the adrenal cortex and corticosteroid production. MSHs are involved in skin pigmentation and appetite regulation. Beta-endorphin acts as a natural pain reliever. Genetically, mutations in POMC are associated with obesity, adrenal insufficiency, and red hair pigmentation due to its impact on melanocortin receptors. The gene is part of the GPCR ligand binding pathway influencing various signaling pathways associated with the receptors it interacts with.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of POMC involve its role in influencing the efficacy and therapeutic response of certain drugs, particularly those affecting the endocrine and the central nervous system. For example, naltrexone, used in the treatment of opioid and alcohol dependence, may have variable efficacy based on POMC expression due to its role in regulating beta-endorphin. Variations in POMC expression and function can alter pain sensitivity and response to opioid analgesics. Research continues to explore POMC-related genetic variations that could predict responses to treatments for conditions like obesity and addictive behaviors, thereby guiding more personalized therapeutic strategies.
