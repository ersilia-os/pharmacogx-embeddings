## Gene Summary
SLC29A2 stands for solute carrier family 29 member 2, also known as equilibrative nucleoside transporter 2 (ENT2). This gene is a part of the equilibrative nucleoside transporters family, which plays a critical role in the transport of nucleosides and nucleobases across cellular membranes. ENT2 facilitates the bidirectional transport of nucleosides and is capable of transporting a broad spectrum of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides. SLC29A2 is expressed in a wide variety of tissues including the liver, intestine, heart, and brain. Its expression and functionality are pivotal for maintaining nucleoside homeostasis in cells and may influence various physiological processes such as purine and pyrimidine metabolism.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SLC29A2 influences the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are nucleoside analogs, which are commonly used as antiviral or anticancer agents. This gene is implicated in several cellular and biochemical pathways, primarily involving the metabolism and transport of nucleosides and nucleotides. Diseases associated with dysregulation or mutations in SLC29A2 include certain types of cardiac abnormalities and sensitivity to infectious diseases, due to its role in nucleoside transport and metabolism. Its involvement extends to phenotypes related to drug absorption and metabolism, which can significantly affect therapeutic outcomes in treatments involving nucleoside analogs.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, SLC29A2 has significant implications due to its role in the transport of nucleoside-derived drugs. It influences the effectiveness and toxicity profiles of drugs such as cladribine, a purine nucleoside analog used primarily for treating hairy cell leukemia. Variants in the SLC29A2 gene can affect the cellular uptake and efficacy of such drugs, potentially leading to variability in treatment response among individuals. Additionally, understanding the genetic variants of SLC29A2 can help predict patient sensitivity to certain chemotherapeutic agents, which can be crucial for optimizing dosages and minimizing adverse effects. This gene's pharmacogenetic profile is important for personalized medicine, especially in cancer chemotherapy and antiviral therapies where nucleoside analogs are extensively used.
