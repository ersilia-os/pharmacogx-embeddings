## Gene Summary
DPEP1, or dipeptidase 1, is a gene that encodes for a membrane-bound glycoprotein associated with the degradation of dipeptides in the kidney, and it is particularly active in the brush border. The enzyme specifically catalyzes the hydrolysis of dipeptide bonds, playing a crucial role in the final step of renal metabolism of glutathione. DPEP1 is also important in the catabolism of leukotriene B4, a potent mediator of inflammation, into biologically less active products. Expression of DPEP1 is predominantly noted in the kidney but it is also found in other tissues including the intestines and lungs.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
DPEP1 has been implicated in various renal conditions due to its significant role in kidney function. Mutations and dysregulation of DPEP1 may lead to nephropathy and are associated with chronic kidney disease progression. In inflammation, as it is involved in leukotriene B4 degradation, it also plays a role in inflammatory processes and potentially in inflammatory diseases. Pathways associated with DPEP1 include glutathione metabolism and leukotriene degradation, both crucial for cellular detoxification and resolution of inflammation.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic aspects of DPEP1 are not extensively documented, suggesting a need for further exploration in this area. However, given its role in metabolism of compounds like leukotriene B4, DPEP1 modifications could influence the effectiveness and toxicity of drugs targeting inflammatory pathways or drugs metabolized via glutathione-related mechanisms. Further, because of its expression in kidney and involvement in renal catabolism, genetic variations in DPEP1 might influence the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of renal excreted drugs, impacting their efficacy and safety profiles. This suggests potential for personalized medicine approaches in tailoring treatments for renal and inflammatory conditions, where DPEP1 activity could be a factor.
