## Gene Summary
ZNF165, officially known as Zinc Finger Protein 165, is a member of the Kr√ºppel-like family of zinc finger proteins. These proteins are transcriptional regulators, and their common feature is the zinc finger domains, which are critical for binding to DNA. The gene encodes a protein involved in the transcriptional regulation of gene expression. ZNF165 expression shows tissue-specificity, primarily expressed in testis, and plays roles in development and mitogenesis. The protein itself contains several C2H2-type zinc fingers, which are typical of transcription factors that bind to DNA and influence the expression of other genes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Currently, there is limited information directly linking ZNF165 with specific drugs or diseases, reflecting a gap in the understanding or the specificity of this protein's role in pathological states. ZNF165's function in transcription regulation suggests it could be implicated in cellular processes like cell cycle control, apoptosis, and differentiation. Given its primary expression in the testis, it might be involved in reproductive biology and associated disorders, though concrete associations with specific phenotypes or diseases require further investigation.

## Pharmacogenetics
To date, pharmacogenetic studies specifically involving ZNF165 are scarce or non-existent. The gene is not prominently featured in standard pharmacogenetic references, likely due to its unclear involvement in the metabolism of drugs or its impact on treatment outcomes in any known diseases. Future research may reveal such links as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and more detailed pharmacogenetic explorations are conducted, which could uncover potential interactions of this zinc finger protein that influence drug responses or susceptibility to diseases where gene regulation plays a critical role.
