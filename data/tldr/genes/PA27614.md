## Gene Summary
EDN1, or Endothelin 1, is a potent vasoconstrictor and a member of the endothelin protein family which is primarily involved in the regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure. The gene is located on chromosome 6 and expresses a preproprotein that is cleaved to give rise to the active form known as endothelin-1. This peptide is primarily secreted by endothelial cells but is also found in other tissues like the brain, kidney, and lungs. The actions of EDN1 are mediated through its interaction with endothelin receptors, specifically endothelin receptor type A and B, triggering a variety of signal transduction pathways which influence vascular smooth muscle tone and cell proliferation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
EDN1 is implicated in a variety of cardiovascular diseases primarily due to its role in vasoconstriction and blood pressure regulation. Conditions such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and heart failure have all been associated with variations in the expression or function of EDN1. The gene is also linked to non-cardiovascular diseases, including cancer and pulmonary disorders, where its expression can influence tumor growth and pulmonary arterial pressure. Pharmacologically, the endothelin system has been targeted for therapeutic interventions, notably in managing pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic heart failure. The key pathways involving EDN1 include those related to the regulation of vascular and systemic arterial pressure and endothelin signaling pathways.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of EDN1 is particularly significant in the context of cardiovascular and renal diseases, where it influences responses to specific therapies. EDN1 polymorphisms have been studied for correlations with the efficacy and safety of endothelin receptor antagonists, drugs commonly used in treating pulmonary arterial hypertension and potentially other vascular disorders. For example, variants within the EDN1 gene may lead to differing patient responses to drugs such as bosentan or ambrisentan, which are endothelin receptor antagonists. Understanding the genetic variations in EDN1 can help in personalizing treatment plans for better management of diseases where endothelin-1 plays a critical role, enhancing both the efficacy and safety of therapeutic interventions.
