## Gene Summary
EYA1 (Eyes Absent Homolog 1) is a crucial gene encoding a member of the eyes absent (EYA) family of proteins. This gene is involved in organ development and maintenance by functioning as a transcriptional activator and a tyrosine phosphatase. EYA1 is vital in eye formation, as suggested by its name, but it also plays diverse roles in the development of other structures including the ears, kidneys, and skeletal system. Expression of EYA1 is pronounced during embryonic development, especially in the structures that form the senses and some glands.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in EYA1 are primarily associated with a range of congenital disorders. Key among these is Branchiootorenal (BOR) syndrome, a developmental condition characterized by the combination of branchial arch anomalies, otic (ear) malformations, and renal (kidney) dysfunctions. EYA1 mutations are also linked to other less common phenotypes affecting similar organs. The EYA1 gene is involved in several developmental pathways, including those governing the organogenesis of auditory and renal systems. These critical functions underscore its importance in both normal human development and the manifestation of related genetic disorders.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, EYA1 has not been extensively linked to adverse drug reactions or drug efficacy variations like some other genes more directly involved in drug metabolism or drug targets. The primary focus on EYA1 in a medical setting is related to genetic testing and counseling, particularly in families with histories of Branchiootorenal syndrome or related congenital conditions. Given its crucial role in developmental pathways and disease, research might still uncover potential interactions or implications in pharmacogenetic contexts, particularly how its pathway interactions could influence responses to drugs affecting cellular growth or differentiation processes. However, as of now, specific drugs influenced by EYA1 gene variants are not well documented.
