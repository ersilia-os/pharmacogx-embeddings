## Gene Summary
CSK, or C-terminal Src kinase, is a gene that encodes a protein kinase involved in the regulation of signal transduction pathways. CSK is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a pivotal role in controlling cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation by inactivating several Src family kinases such as SRC, FYN, and LCK through phosphorylation. Predominantly expressed in all tissues, with a higher expression in the spleen and the thymus, CSK links with receptors such as the B-cell receptor and T-cell receptor. 

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CSK is implicated in several key cellular pathways, including the regulation of immune cell signaling and tumorigenesis. The gene may influence diseases mainly involving immune functions, such as autoimmune diseases, and is also studied for its role in cancer development and progression. The function of CSK in deactivating oncogenic Src family kinases ties it to pathways involving cell migration, adhesion, and invasion, which are crucial in cancer metastasis. Additionally, CSK has a role in phenotype presentations related to the immune response, potentially influencing susceptibility to infections and the severity of immune-mediated disorders.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, CSK is not predominantly highlighted; however, its role in modulating kinase activity implicates its potential influence in treatments involving kinase inhibitors, particularly in cancer therapy. Although specific pharmacogenetic associations between CSK and drug responses are not thoroughly documented, understanding the regulation of Src family kinases by CSK can aid in optimizing therapeutic strategies that target these kinases in various cancers. It suggests a broader aspect of gene-drug interactions, primarily through the pathway context, rather than direct drug-gene interactions. Further research could elucidate specific impacts of genetic variants within CSK on the efficacy and toxicity of kinase inhibitors.
