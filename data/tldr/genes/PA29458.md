## Gene Summary
HRH3, short for Histamine Receptor H3, is a gene that encodes the H3 subtype of histamine receptors. These receptors are predominantly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and to a lesser extent in peripheral tissues. The HRH3 receptor functions primarily as an autoreceptor and heteroreceptor on histaminergic nerve terminals, modulating the release of histamine and other neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. Its role is crucial in the regulation of sleep-wake cycles, appetite, cognitive functions, and various neuroendocrine processes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
HRH3 is implicated in the pathophysiology of various CNS disorders, including sleep disturbances, obesity, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It also plays a role in neuroinflammatory responses. The receptor is targeted pharmacologically by the development of H3 antagonists/inverse agonists, which hold therapeutic potential for treating narcolepsy, excessive daytime sleepiness, and other conditions associated with hypersomnia. Moreover, manipulation of HRH3 signaling has been explored for its potential in weight management and cognitive enhancement.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, HRH3 variants have been studied concerning antihistamine response with implications mostly in the management of neurological conditions rather than typical allergic reactions commonly associated with histamine action. Although specific drug associations in a pharmacogenetic context are not fully established, the ability of HRH3 to modulate other neurotransmitter systems positions it as a relevant target for influencing the efficacy and side effect profile of various psychoactive drugs. Currently, HRH3 antagonists such as pitolisant are used to treat conditions like narcolepsy based on their ability to enhance wakefulness and cognitive alertness, and genetic variations in HRH3 could affect individual responses to such treatments.
