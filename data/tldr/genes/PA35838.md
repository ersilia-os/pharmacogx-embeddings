## Gene Summary
SLCO4A1 (solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 4A1) is a gene encoding a protein involved in the transport of organic anions and various compounds across the cell membrane. It belongs to the solute carrier family, specifically within the OATP (organic anion-transporting polypeptides) subfamily. These transporters are crucial for the uptake and distribution of a wide range of both endogenous and exogenous organic anions. They are expressed in numerous tissues; however, SLCO4A1 shows significant expression in the kidney, where it plays a role in the renal clearance of compounds.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The SLCO4A1 protein is involved in the transport of several drugs and other substances across cellular membranes. Although it has broad substrate specificity, there is limited detailed information compared to other family members like SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3. In terms of disease associations, alterations in the expression or function of SLCO4A1 may potentially impact conditions related to improper drug clearance or altered pharmacokinetics of therapeutics. As for pathways, SLCO4A1 integrates into broader biological systems governing solute and drug transport, influencing how substances are absorbed, distributed, and excreted in the human body.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetics of SLCO4A1 remains less explored than some other solute carrier genes, with relatively few specific drug associations described in literature. No specific drugs have been robustly characterized for their interaction with SLCO4A1 in terms of pharmacogenetic relevance. However, given the geneâ€™s role in transporting a variety of organic anions, further research might establish clearer links with pharmacokinetics and response variability in drugs processed via organic anion-transporting polypeptides. Understanding variations in SLCO4A1 could contribute to insights into individual differences in the efficacy and toxicity of medications, particularly those excreted or metabolized by renal pathways where SLCO4A1 is active.
