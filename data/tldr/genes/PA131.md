## Gene Summary
CYP3A5, part of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, is a gene that encodes an enzyme involved in the metabolism of numerous endogenous and exogenous compounds. This enzyme is primarily expressed in the liver and intestines and plays a pivotal role in the oxidative metabolism of drugs and steroids. The expression of CYP3A5 varies significantly among individuals due to genetic polymorphisms, notably influencing the extent and rate of drug metabolism.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CYP3A5 is implicated in the metabolism of a wide range of drugs including tacrolimus, cyclosporine, and various statins. This gene is also connected to several phenotypes, predominantly related to variable drug response. For instance, differences in CYP3A5 expression can affect the efficacy and toxicity of medications, notably in chemotherapy and immunosuppressive therapy. CYP3A5 is part of the cytochrome P450 pathway, substantial in drug metabolism and chemical detoxification.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, CYP3A5 is best known for its impact on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, an immunosuppressant used primarily after organ transplantation. Allelic variants such as CYP3A5*1 (expresser phenotype) and CYP3A5*3 (non-expresser phenotype) lead to significant differences in tacrolimus metabolism, whereby individuals carrying the *1 allele require higher doses to achieve therapeutic drug levels. Other drugs affected by CYP3A5 genetic variants include cyclosporine and the anticoagulant warfarin. Knowledge of a patient's CYP3A5 genotype can guide dosing and improve safety profiles of these drugs, reducing the risk of adverse drug reactions or therapeutic failures.
