## Gene Summary
PPARA (Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Alpha) is a nuclear hormone receptor that plays a pivotal role in the catabolism of fatty acids by regulating genes involved in lipid metabolism and transport. Expressed predominantly in tissues with high oxidative rates such as the liver, heart, and muscles, it functions mainly as a transcription factor activating the expression of genes engaged in processes such as fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis, and glucose metabolism. PPARA activation leads to an increased uptake, utilization, and catabolism of fatty acids.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
PPARA is the target gene for fibrate drugs, which are used clinically to treat hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia by decreasing triglyceride levels and increasing HDL ("good") cholesterol levels. Activation of this receptor also has implications for the regulation of inflammatory responses and has been studied in the context of various metabolic disorders including obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Also noteworthy is the PPARA involvement in liver regeneration pathways and potential connections to carcinogenesis, particularly liver cancer. Its role in modulating lipid levels directly associates it with systemic conditions like metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of PPARA is particularly relevant in the context of fibrate drugs such as fenofibrate and gemfibrozil, which are used to manage lipid levels in individuals with dyslipidemia. Genetic variations in PPARA can influence drug efficacy and safety, impacting how patients metabolize and respond to these medications. For example, specific polymorphisms in the PPARA gene have been linked to differential responses to fibrates, affecting both the lipid-lowering efficacy and the risk of side effects. Understanding these associations is crucial for tailoring more effective, individualized treatment plans for disorders associated with lipid metabolism.
