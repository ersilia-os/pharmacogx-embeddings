## Gene Summary
ZSCAN25, or Zinc Finger and SCAN Domain Containing 25, is a gene that is relatively less characterized compared to other well-studied genes. Located on chromosome 1, ZSCAN25 encodes a protein that is predicted to be involved in DNA-binding and transcription factor activity due to its zinc finger and SCAN domain structures. Zinc finger proteins are usually involved in interacting with DNA, which suggests that ZSCAN25 may play a role in gene expression regulation. However, details on the specific roles and mechanisms of ZSCAN25 in human physiology and pathology are not clearly defined in current literature.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
There is limited information available on the association of ZSCAN25 with specific drugs, diseases, or pathways due to the scant research conducted on this gene so far. Its possible involvement in transcriptional regulation suggests it could potentially be linked to cellular processes such as cell growth and apoptosis, which are common pathways involved in various diseases. Nevertheless, without concrete experimental evidence, these connections remain speculative. Phenotypically, the effects of mutations or variations in ZSCAN25 are not yet documented, leaving a gap in our understanding of its potential impact on human health.

## Pharmacogenetics
As of the current state of knowledge, there are no direct associations between ZSCAN25 and pharmacogenetics that have been firmly established. The gene does not appear in major pharmacogenetics databases like PharmGKB, which catalogues genes with known implications on drug response variability. Thus, it remains unclear whether ZSCAN25 has any impact on the metabolism, efficacy, or toxicity of drugs. Further research is necessary to explore any potential pharmacogenetic roles of ZSCAN25, including its possible interaction with pharmaceutical compounds and influence on treatment outcomes.
