## Gene Summary
DHRS4L1, or Dehydrogenase/Reductase 4 Like 1, is closely related to the DHRS4 gene. Positioned on human chromosome 14, DHRS4L1 belongs to the SDR (short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase) family. These enzymes are known for their significant role in the metabolism of various substrates, including steroids, retinoids, and lipids, via their oxidoreductive activities. Similar to its homolog DHRS4, DHRS4L1 functions in the NADP-dependent reduction of various aldehydes and ketones into their corresponding alcohols.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Currently, there isn't extensive documentation or direct associations of DHRS4L1 with specific drugs or complex diseases. However, studying related genes suggests potential indirect roles in metabolic pathways, including lipid metabolism and steroid hormone biosynthesis. Its function in reductive metabolism might impact the cellular concentrations of biochemical agents, subsequently influencing various metabolic disorders or conditions.

## Pharmacogenetics
As of the current scientific understanding, DHRS4L1 does not have a well-established connection with pharmacogenetics or specific drug interactions. Most pharmacogenetic research focuses on its close relative, DHRS4, which has been noted for its role in the metabolism of certain endogenous substances that may affect drug efficacy and metabolism. Future investigations could potentially reveal how variations in DHRS4L1 might influence drug response or contribute to variable drug effects in patients, particularly in relation to its enzymatic activities.
