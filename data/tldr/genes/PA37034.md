## Gene Summary
TSC1, also known as Tuberous Sclerosis 1, encodes the protein hamartin. This gene is involved in the regulation of cellular growth and size, and it functions primarily through the mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) signaling pathway. TSC1 forms a complex with another protein encoded by the TSC2 gene, which helps in inhibiting the mTORC1 complex, a critical component in cell growth and metabolism. TSC1 expression is regulated in a variety of tissues throughout the body.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in TSC1 are intricately linked with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a genetic disorder characterized by the development of benign tumors in various organs including the brain, skin, heart, eyes, kidneys, and lungs. This disorder can manifest in a range of symptoms from seizures and intellectual disability to skin abnormalities and renal dysfunction. TSC1's pathway involvement goes beyond TSC, impacting cellular processes such as cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival via the mTOR signaling pathway. This pathway is significant in disorders other than tuberous sclerosis, including certain types of cancers and neurological diseases.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, TSC1 mutations have a direct implication in the effectiveness and response to certain drugs. The mTOR inhibitors, such as everolimus and sirolimus, are used particularly in the treatment of tuberous sclerosis complex to reduce the growth of tumors developed due to dysregulated mTORC1 signaling. Given the role of TSC1 in mTOR regulation, variations in the TSC1 gene can potentially alter the therapeutic response to these inhibitors. Further research into TSC1 variants continues to provide insight into personalized medicine approaches for treating TSC and other related conditions where mTOR signaling is disrupted.
