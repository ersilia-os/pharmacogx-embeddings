## Gene Summary
NUP62, or Nucleoporin 62, is a gene encoding a component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The NPC is a critical structure that spans the nuclear envelope, regulating the transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. NUP62 is located in the central channel of the NPC and plays a vital role in the nucleocytoplasmic transport of proteins and RNA. The protein is involved in processes such as cell cycle control, signaling pathways, and viral replication. NUP62 is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, indicating its fundamental role in cellular functions.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NUP62 is implicated in several cellular pathways, primarily related to nuclear transport and cellular signaling mechanisms. Although NUP62 itself is not directly targeted by specific drugs, its dysfunction can be associated with several disease conditions, particularly those involving aberrations in nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking. Mutations and alterations in the expression of NUP62 have been examined in the context of neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and potentially other tauopathies. Disruptions in NUP62 function have also been linked to virus infections, where certain viruses utilize the nuclear pore complex components to facilitate their replication and assembly.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics related to NUP62 is less documented compared to other genes involved directly in drug metabolism. However, the gene's role in essential cellular processes underscores its potential impact on the pharmacodynamics of several drugs, particularly those influencing nuclear-cytoplasmic transport or relying on cellular entry mechanisms. In viral diseases, understanding the interaction between NUP62 and viral proteins could provide insights into the efficacy or resistance mechanisms against antiviral drugs. Despite a direct association with specific drug responses not being robustly characterized, ongoing research might reveal more defined relationships between NUP62 functional variations and drug effects, especially in the context of targeted therapies for diseases involving nuclear transport dysfunctions.
