## Gene Summary
HDAC1, or histone deacetylase 1, is a member of the class I of the histone deacetylase family. This gene encodes an enzyme that is crucial for the modulation of chromatin structure and plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle progression, and developmental events. HDAC1 can be found in most eukaryotic cells and is ubiquitously expressed across different tissue types. This enzyme functions mainly through the removal of acetyl groups from an Îµ-N-acetyl lysine amino acid on a histone, allowing the histones to wrap the DNA more tightly.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
HDAC1 is involved in several key cellular pathways including cell cycle control, apoptosis, and DNA replication. It impacts various cancers, neurodegenerative disorders, and developmental abnormalities through its role in epigenetic modification. Aberrant expression or mutation of HDAC1 has been associated with the progression of various cancers including colorectal, breast, and gastric cancers. HDAC1's activity affects several signaling pathways such as the p53 pathway, involved in tumor suppression, and the Wnt pathway playing roles in cell proliferation and differentiation.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, HDAC1 is a target for a class of drugs known as HDAC inhibitors (HDACis), which are used prominently in cancer therapy. Drugs such as Vorinostat, Romidepsin, and Panobinostat are some examples of HDACis. These inhibitors have shown effectiveness especially in the treatment of hematological malignancies like cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and multiple myeloma. The responsiveness to these drugs can vary based on the HDAC1 gene mutation status and expression levels, influencing treatment outcomes in patients. Thus, understanding the genetic variations in HDAC1 can help in tailoring personalized treatment strategies, potentially enhancing the efficacy and reducing the toxicity of HDACis.
