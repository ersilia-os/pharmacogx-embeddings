## Gene Summary
SLC22A6, also known as the organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1), is a protein-coding gene involved in the transport and excretion of various endogenous and exogenous organic anions, especially in the kidneys. The primary function of SLC22A6 is to mediate the high-affinity exchange of organic ions by transporting them from the blood into the urine. This process is crucial for the normal elimination of toxins and drugs from the body. SLC22A6 is expressed predominantly in the proximal tubule cells of the kidney but is also found in other tissues such as the brain, liver, and placenta.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SLC22A6 is directly involved in the renal clearance of compounds, including widely used drugs such as diuretics, antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and antivirals. As a result of its key role in drug excretion, variations in SLC22A6 can affect drug pharmacokinetics and toxicities. Diseases associated with dysfunction or altered expression of SLC22A6 include various renal disorders and potentially contribute to hypertension due to altered handling of organic anions. The gene is part of the solute carrier family, which includes several transporters that participate in significant pharmacological and physiological pathways, influencing electrolyte balance, acid-base homeostasis, and blood pressure regulation.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, SLC22A6 plays a significant role due to its impact on the elimination of drugs from the body. Genetic variants in SLC22A6 can significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of specific drugs, altering their efficacy and toxicity. For instance, reduced function alleles of SLC22A6 have been associated with altered response to the antidiabetic drug metformin and the antiviral oseltamivir, among others. Additionally, individuals carrying certain genetic variants may experience different therapeutic outcomes or adverse effects when using NSAIDs or certain antibiotics, which are substrates of the OAT1 transporter. Understanding SLC22A6 pharmacogenetics is crucial for personalized medicine approaches, aiming to optimize therapy regimens based on genetic profiles to improve drug efficacy and reduce side effects.
