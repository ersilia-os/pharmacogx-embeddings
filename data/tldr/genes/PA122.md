## Gene Summary
CYP3A7 is an enzyme encoded by the CYP3A7 gene in humans, prominently expressed in fetal liver, though it is largely replaced by other CYP3A enzymes like CYP3A4 after birth. CYP3A7 is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes, proteins that are crucial in metabolizing medications and synthesizing cholesterol, steroids, and other lipids. The expression of CYP3A7 is controlled by developmental signals and its presence in fetal liver suggests its role in the metabolic adaptation from a maternal to an external environment post-birth.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CYP3A7 is involved in the oxidative metabolism of steroid hormone precursors and some xenobiotics. Its role is primarily perceived during fetal development where it contributes to the metabolism of endogenous steroids. Pathologically, aberrations in CYP3A7 expression have been linked with variations in drug metabolism rates, impacting both therapeutic efficacy and risk of adverse drug reactions. Regarding disease associations, variations in this gene’s expression or function due to genetic polymorphism can influence steroid metabolism, potentially affecting developmental and metabolic disorders.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, the CYP3A7 gene impacts the metabolic processing of certain drugs predominantly during the fetal stage, with implications carried into infancy. Notably, CYP3A7 is involved in the metabolism of some drugs used ante- and perinatally. While specific drug data linked directly to CYP3A7 is limited, the enzyme’s role in converting dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) to estrogen suggests an indirect influence on the pharmacokinetics of drugs modulated by these hormones. Also, polymorphisms in CYP3A7 could alter drug response in neonates for drugs typically metabolized by CYP3A enzymes, such as certain corticosteroids and opioid medications. Understanding these interactions is key for optimizing drug dosing and minimizing toxicity in neonatal and infant populations.
