## Gene Summary
RARG, or Retinoic Acid Receptor Gamma, is a nuclear receptor and transcription factor that mediates the biological effects of retinoids by binding to specific DNA sequences. These retinoids are metabolically converted from vitamin A and play crucial roles in cellular growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, especially in the skin and immune system. The expression of RARG is notably high in the skin, lung, and adipose tissue, and it is instrumental in the development of several tissues, including the central nervous system.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The activity of RARG is implicated in a variety of biological pathways, mainly involving the regulation of gene expression by retinoic acid, which influences cell differentiation and apoptosis. Dysregulation of RARG function or expression can lead to disorders, particularly affecting the skin such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. Moreover, the involvement of RARG in retinoic acid signaling makes it relevant in the context of developmental diseases and cancers, notably lung cancer, where altered retinoic acid signaling can contribute to disease pathogenesis.

## Pharmacogenetics
From a pharmacogenetic viewpoint, RARG has been studied primarily for its role in mediating the effects of retinoids used in dermatology and oncology. Drugs such as bexarotene, a rexinoid used for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, target RARG. The effectiveness and adverse effects of such treatments can vary depending on the individual's specific RARG gene variations. Genetic differences in RARG might influence the therapeutic outcomes of retinoids, reflecting variations in drug efficacy and toxicity profiles among individuals. Although RARG is less studied compared to other members of the retinoic acid receptor family, its role in the retinoid response suggests potential pharmacogenetic applications that could tailor treatments to individual genetic makeups.
