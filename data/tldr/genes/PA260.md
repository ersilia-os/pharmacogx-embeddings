## Gene Summary
ORM1, also known as Orosomucoid 1 or alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, is primarily a liver-produced acute-phase plasma protein. It plays a significant role in modulating immune response and acts as a transport protein for various endogenous and exogenous compounds, including a range of drugs. ORM1 is upregulated during acute-phase response to inflammation, injury, or infection. The protein structure of ORM1 is notable for its capacity to bind to various ligands, influencing their distribution and clearance in the body.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ORM1 is implicated in several biological pathways and physiological processes, with a notable role in the inflammatory response and modulating the pharmacokinetics of therapeutic drugs. Diseases associated with alterations in ORM1 expression include inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and various infections where an acute phase response is triggered. The protein’s high affinity for a range of drug molecules makes it an essential player in the pharmacokinetics of these drugs, affecting their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, ORM1 is of interest primarily due to its drug-binding properties. Variations in ORM1 expression or function can alter the plasma levels and effects of various drugs, leading to differences in drug efficacy and safety. For instance, the protein binds to and influences the pharmacokinetics of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and several types of anti-inflammatory drugs. The gene’s polymorphisms might impact the binding affinity, thereby potentially modifying the therapeutic outcomes and adverse effects in treatments involving these drugs. Further research into ORM1 could enhance understanding of individual responses to therapeutics, particularly in the context of personalized medicine.
