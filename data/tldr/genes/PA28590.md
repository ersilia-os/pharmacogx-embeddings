## Gene Summary
**GATM**, also known as glycine amidinotransferase, is an enzyme involved in creatine biosynthesis, primarily converting arginine and glycine to guanidinoacetate, the immediate precursor of creatine. This enzyme is expressed in various tissues but predominantly in the kidneys and pancreas. GATM plays a critical role in energy metabolism by facilitating the storage and transport of energy in the form of phosphocreatine in muscle and brain tissue.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations and dysfunction in the GATM gene are linked to a rare metabolic disorder known as Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency. This disorder is characterized by a reduction in creatine levels in the brain, leading to developmental delay, intellectual disability, and seizures. The key biochemical phenotype associated with GATM dysfunction is decreased levels of creatine and increased levels of guanidinoacetate in body fluids. As part of the creatine synthesis pathway, GATM is vital for maintaining energy homeostasis in tissues with high energy demands.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of GATM primarily relates to its role in creatine metabolism. While specific drug interactions and pharmacogenetic implications are not extensively documented, alterations in GATM activity can theoretically influence the efficacy and metabolism of creatine supplementation used in treating GAMT deficiency and potentially other metabolic disorders. Patients with GAMT deficiency might also show different responses to treatments that affect creatine synthesis or are altered by creatine levels in the body. Thus, understanding GATM genotypes could contribute to personalized approaches in managing conditions associated with creatine metabolism.
