## Gene Summary
GPR83, also known as G-protein coupled receptor 83, is a member of the rhodopsin family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This gene is primarily expressed in the brain, including regions like the hypothalamus, and is involved in regulating endocrine and neural functions. GPR83 is known to play a role in modulating inflammatory responses and in the control of feeding behavior. The protein encoded by this gene is speculated to function as a receptor for an unknown ligand and is considered important in neuroendocrine pathways.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
While specific drugs targeting GPR83 are not well documented, the gene has been implicated in various neurological and metabolic disorders due to its expression in the brain. Research suggests that GPR83 may influence conditions related to obesity and energy homeostasis, making it a potential target for obesity treatment. Genetic variations in GPR83 have been associated with alterations in body mass index (BMI) and obesity phenotypes. The geneâ€™s pathways predominantly involve neuroendocrine signaling, reflecting its significant role in hypothalamic functions that regulate energy balance and possibly immune responses.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of GPR83 are not extensively studied, and there are currently no direct associations between GPR83 variants and specific drug responses. However, given its role in neurological pathways and potential influence on obesity and metabolic health, GPR83 could be relevant in the pharmacogenetics of drugs targeting these pathways. Future research may uncover relationships between genetic variations in GPR83 and response to treatments for metabolic or inflammatory conditions, potentially guiding personalized approaches in these areas.
