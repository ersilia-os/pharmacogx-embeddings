## Gene Summary
**OPRD1** stands for the opioid receptor delta 1. It encodes a protein that is part of the opioid receptor family and is expressed predominantly in the brain and, to a lesser extent, in peripheral tissues. OPRD1 mediates the effects of endogenous opioids and opioid drugs on pain perception, mood regulation, and reward processing by inhibiting adenylate cyclase activity, closing of voltage-gated calcium channels, and opening of potassium channels upon activation. Its distinctive expression in the brain's limbic system, thalamus, and striatum highlights its role in modulating emotional responses and pain sensation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
OPRD1 is implicated in a range of neuropsychiatric conditions, including addiction, depression, and anxiety disorders. The receptor's role in emotional regulation and pain mediation also ties it to chronic pain conditions and opioid addiction. At the pathway level, OPRD1 is involved in the opioid signaling pathway that influences neurotransmitter release and neuronal excitability, affecting pain and emotional states. Given its role in these fundamental biological processes, OPRD1 is a potential target for drugs aiming to treat pain, mood disorders, and drug dependency.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of OPRD1 reveals significant interactions with several opioid drugs, particularly in the context of pain management and the treatment of addiction. Variants in OPRD1 have been associated with varying responses to opioids, with some alleles linked to a heightened risk of opioid dependence. Research has shown that SNPs such as rs569356 in OPRD1 can affect the efficacy and addiction potential of drugs like oxycodone and morphine. This receptor is also an important consideration in the personalized treatment of mood disorders, as individual variations can influence the therapeutic outcomes of using certain opioids in treating conditions like major depressive disorder. Understanding these genetic differences can lead to more precisely tailored therapies that consider both efficacy and risks of addiction.
