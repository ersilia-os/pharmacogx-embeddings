## Gene Summary
ABCC3, also known as ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 3, is a gene that encodes for a protein of the same name, which is part of the ABC transporter family. The function of ABCC3 predominantly involves the transport of various molecules across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. This transmembrane protein is particularly involved in the transport of bile acids, conjugated steroids, and other substrates such as glucuronidated xenobiotics, playing an important role in multidrug resistance and the detoxification pathways of various drugs and environmental toxins. The gene is primarily expressed in the liver, with significant expression levels also observed in the intestine, kidneys, and other tissues.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ABCC3 is implicated in several biological pathways regarding the transportation of substances across membranes. The gene plays critical roles in bile acid and bile salt transport, potentially impacting diseases related to liver function, such as cholestasis and other liver disorders. Aberrant expression or function of ABCC3 has been associated with several types of cancer, notably hepatocellular carcinoma. Phenotypically, alterations in ABCC3 can influence drug pharmacokinetics and disposition, affecting drug efficacy and toxicity. It is involved in the cellular efflux of many xenobiotics and is a part of the Phase III metabolism of various compounds, working alongside conjugation enzymes from Phase II metabolism.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, ABCC3 is of significant interest due to its role in modulating the transport and, hence, the effects of various drugs. Variants within the ABCC3 gene can affect the expression and functionality of the transporter, leading to differences in drug disposition and response among individuals. This has implications for numerous drugs, including irinotecan, a chemotherapeutic agent where altered ABCC3 function may impact drug excretion and toxicity. Additionally, the transporter-influenced pharmacokinetics of mercaptopurine, a drug used in the treatment of leukemia, and methotrexate, used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancer, highlight its pharmacogenetic importance. Understanding genetic variations within ABCC3 can aid in optimizing dose regimens and minimizing side effects for these and other drugs, contributing to personalized medicine approaches.
