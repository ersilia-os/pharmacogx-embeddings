## Gene Summary
NTRK1 (Neurotrophic Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 1) is a gene encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase protein, which is critical in the development and function of the nervous system. The protein product, TrkA, is activated through binding with nerve growth factor (NGF) leading to a signal transduction cascade that promotes cell survival and differentiation. TrkA plays a pivotal role particularly in the sensory neurons of the neural crest and CNS. The expression of NTRK1 is primarily found in neural tissues but can also be seen in non-neuronal tissues, impacting various cellular processes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NTRK1 is implicated in several diseases, most notably in congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA), a rare genetic disorder characterized by the inability to feel pain and temperature, and decreased or absent sweating (anhidrosis). Mutations in NTRK1 leading to loss of TrkA function are directly responsible for the phenotype seen in CIPA. The gene is also linked to susceptibility to obesity and has been studied in various cancers, including breast and colorectal cancers. Pathways involving NTRK1 include those related to neurotrophin/TRK signaling, which are crucial for the survival, development, and function of neurons.

## Pharmacogenetics
In terms of pharmacogenetics, NTRK1 and its encoded protein TrkA are targets in cancer therapy, particularly in tumors where NTRK1 is mutated or abnormally expressed. Drugs like larotrectinib and entrectinib are TRK inhibitors used specifically to target cancers harboring genetic alterations in NTRK genes including NTRK1. These drugs have shown significant efficacy in shrinking tumors in a clinical setting, marking a critical advance in the treatment of NTRK1-related cancers. The pharmacogenetic response to these drugs can vary based on the specific mutations within NTRK1 which influence the effectiveness and potential resistance to therapy.
