## Gene Summary
XRCC5, also known as Ku80, is a key component of the DNA-dependent protein kinase complex (DNA-PK), which plays a crucial role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) primarily through the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. XRCC5 forms a heterodimer with XRCC6 (Ku70), and this complex binds to the broken ends of DNA. This binding is critical for the protection of DNA ends and for recruiting additional proteins necessary for DSB repair. XRCC5 is involved in maintaining genomic stability and is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, reflecting its fundamental role in cellular processes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
XRCC5's pivotal function in DNA repair implicates it in a range of diseases, particularly those related to genomic instability such as cancer. Alterations in XRCC5 expression or function have been linked to increased susceptibility to cancer, as defects in the NHEJ pathway enhance the rate of mutagenesis and chromosomal aberrations. The gene's role in DNA repair also makes it a candidate gene in studies on ageing, autoimmune disorders, and responses to DNA-damaging treatments such as ionizing radiation and certain chemotherapeutics.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, XRCC5 has notable implications in cancer treatment. Variations in XRCC5 can influence the efficacy and toxicity of certain chemotherapeutic agents, especially those that induce DNA breaks, such as platinum-based drugs (cisplatin, carboplatin), etoposide, and ionizing radiation. Patients with certain polymorphisms in XRCC5 may experience differences in treatment outcomes, potentially due to altered DNA repair capabilities which can affect tumor cell survival and the therapeutic index of genotoxic drugs. Identifying these genetic variations can help tailor and optimize cancer therapy to individual genetic profiles, enhancing efficacy while minimizing adverse effects.
