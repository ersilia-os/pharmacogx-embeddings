## Gene Summary
MUTYH, or MutY Homolog, is a gene that encodes a DNA glycosylase involved in oxidative DNA damage repair. This enzyme plays a critical role in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, primarily by removing adenines misincorporated opposite 8-oxoguanine, a common oxidative lesion in DNA. Therefore, MUTYH helps maintain genomic stability by preventing mutations that result from oxidative DNA damage. The protein is expressed in various tissues, with significant relevance in gastrointestinal tissues which ties into its disease associations.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
MUTYH is most prominently associated with MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP), an autosomal recessive colorectal cancer syndrome. Individuals with biallelic mutations in MUTYH are at a heightened risk for developing colorectal adenomas and carcinomas. The gene is implicated in the pathway of base excision repair, contributing to the correction of oxidative DNA damage. MUTYH mutations have also been linked to an increased risk of other cancers, such as endometrial and ovarian cancers.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of MUTYH mainly relates to cancer risk management and surveillance for individuals with MUTYH mutations. There are currently no direct pharmacogenetic associations involving specific drugs that modulate MUTYH activity. Instead, the focus for individuals with MUTYH mutations is on regular screening and possibly preventive surgery for colorectal cancer (e.g., prophylactic colectomy). Understanding MUTYH mutation status can guide decisions regarding the intensity and onset of surveillance strategies. Furthermore, MUTYH status may influence the use of chemopreventive agents like aspirin in high-risk individuals, although direct interactions between such drugs and MUTYH activity have not been defined in pharmacogenetic contexts.
