## Gene Summary
CYP2E1, or Cytochrome P450 2E1, is part of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes, which are pivotal in the metabolism of various substances including drugs, toxins, and endogenous compounds. CYP2E1 is known for its role in metabolizing small molecules, notably alcohol and various solvents. It is expressed predominantly in the liver but can also be found in the brain and kidneys. Expression of CYP2E1 is induced by ethanol, isoniazid, and certain other chemicals, suggesting its upregulation in response to exposure to specific substances that it metabolizes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CYP2E1 metabolizes a number of clinically important drugs and is involved in the metabolic activation of procarcinogens like nitrosamines, which are linked with increased cancer risk. The gene plays a significant role in the ethanol metabolism pathway, contributing to the production of acetaldehyde, a toxic metabolite implicated in alcoholic liver disease and other pathologies associated with alcohol consumption. Due to its broad substrate specificity, variations in CYP2E1 activity can influence the risk and progression of various diseases, including liver diseases and certain types of cancers.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic studies have shown that variations in CYP2E1 can affect an individualâ€™s response to several drugs. For instance, the activity of CYP2E1 influences the toxicity and clearance of acetaminophen (paracetamol), with implications for risk of liver damage at high doses. Inter-individual variability in CYP2E1 expression and function can also affect the metabolism of isoniazid, a core antitubercular drug, potentially impacting both efficacy and toxicity. Furthermore, genetic polymorphisms in CYP2E1 are associated with differential susceptibility to the carcinogenic effects of tobacco smoke and alcohol, particularly in the context of esophageal and liver cancers. Therapeutic outcomes and side effect profiles of these and other substances are therefore linked to specific CYP2E1 genotypes, underscoring the importance of this enzyme in precision medicine and personalized treatment approaches.
