## Gene Summary
ERCC3, also known as Excision Repair 3, is a gene that encodes a protein critical for nucleotide excision repair (NER) of DNA damaged by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation or other chemical mutagens. The ERCC3 protein, which is also a component of the basal transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex, has both DNA-dependent ATPase and DNA helicase activities. These activities are vital for unwinding the DNA duplex to allow access to the damaged strand during the NER process. ERCC3 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, playing a crucial role in maintaining genome stability and preventing carcinogenesis.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ERCC3 is closely associated with several genodermatoses characterized by sensitivity to UV light, such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne syndrome, indicating its pivotal role in DNA repair mechanisms that protect against sun-induced genotoxicity. Mutations in this gene can lead to defects in NER, contributing to the pathogenesis of these disorders. Due to its function in both DNA repair and basal transcription, ERCC3 is also implicated in general transcription consistency, influencing cellular function and stability across different organ systems. The gene is part of key biological pathways including transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), global-genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER), and basic transcriptional processes.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, ERCC3 has been studied for its associations with differential responses to chemotherapy agents, particularly in cancer treatment where DNA repair mechanisms can influence therapeutic outcomes. Polymorphisms in ERCC3 have been linked to varying responses and toxicities with platinum-based drugs such as cisplatin, which is used widely in treating cancers including lung, ovarian, and testicular cancers. The effectiveness and side effects of such treatments can differ significantly depending on the genetic makeup of the ERCC3 gene in individuals, highlighting its importance in personalized medicine. Further understanding and profiling of ERCC3 genetic variants hold potential for optimizing cancer therapies and minimizing adverse drug reactions by tailoring treatments to genetic backgrounds.
