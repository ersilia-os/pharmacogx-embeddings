## Gene Summary
IL4R (Interleukin 4 Receptor) encodes the alpha chain of the interleukin 4 receptor, which is a type I transmembrane protein involved in the interleukin-4-induced immune response. This receptor plays a significant role in the differentiation of naive helper T cells (Th0 cells) to Th2 cells. Binding of IL4 (interleukin 4) to the IL4R promotes Th2 cell proliferation and the immunoglobulin E (IgE) production, pivotal for the allergic response. IL4R is expressed in a variety of cell types including B cells, T cells, and monocytes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
IL4R is directly related to various immunological diseases, most notably allergic inflammation and asthma, given its role in Th2 cell activation and IgE production. Mutations and variations in the regulation of this gene have been linked to susceptibility to several allergic and autoimmune conditions. Key pathways involving IL4R include the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which is crucial for transmitting information from extracellular chemical signals to the cell nucleus, and the regulation of immune response pathways, particularly in allergic and inflammatory processes.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of IL4R mainly pertains to its role in moderating the immune response through its effect on interleukin signaling, which has implications for diseases such as asthma and allergies. Specific variants of IL4R have been associated with altered responses to drugs like dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signaling. Dupilumab is used in the treatment of diseases like atopic dermatitis, asthma, and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, where IL4R-mediated signaling is pathogenically significant. Understanding the genetic variations in IL4R can help in tailoring personalized therapeutic approaches and predicting patient response to these biologic therapies.
