## Gene Summary
VEGFC (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C) is crucial for the development and maintenance of lymphatic vessels, enhancing lymphangiogenesis. It primarily binds to the receptor tyrosine kinases FLT4/VEGFR-3 and, to a lesser extent, KDR/VEGFR-2. VEGFC plays a significant role in embryonic vascular development, promoting endothelial cell growth, migration, and survival. The expression of VEGFC is noted in various tissues, but prominently in tissues related to cardiovascular and lymphatic health.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
VEGFC is implicated in several pathological conditions, most notably in cancer where it can enhance tumor growth and metastasis by promoting angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Disorders such as lymphedema and other lymphatic-related abnormalities have also been associated with dysregulation of VEGFC. The gene participates in critical pathways like PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which influences cellular processes such as proliferation and survival. Its role in developing the lymphatic system links it to studies in developmental biology and diseases involving vascular abnormalities.

## Pharmacogenetics
Despite the significant role of VEGFC in angiogenesis and potential implications in treatment efficacy, specific pharmacogenetic associations involving drug interactions or modifications based on VEGFC genetic variants are not extensively documented. The therapeutic strategies targeting VEGFC typically involve the use of biological agents aimed at inhibiting its activity to counteract tumor growth and metastasis. However, as the research field expands, understanding how variations in VEGFC could affect drug efficacy or patient response may emerge, particularly in cancer therapeutics where angiogenesis is a vital target.
