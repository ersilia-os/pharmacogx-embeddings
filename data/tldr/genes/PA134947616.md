## Gene Summary
EIF2AK4 (Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 2 Alpha Kinase 4), also known as GCN2, is a protein-coding gene in humans. It encodes a kinase involved in the cellular response to amino acid deprivation, ultraviolet radiation, and immunological stress. It plays a key role in the integrated stress response (ISR) by phosphorylating the alpha subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), leading to a reduction in protein synthesis and helping the cell to conserve resources under stress conditions. EIF2AK4 is expressed in various tissues but particularly noted in metabolic and immunological contexts.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
EIF2AK4 is notably implicated in Pulmonary Venous Occlusive Disease (PVOD) and Pulmonary Capillary Hemangiomatosis (PCH), both of which are rare forms of pulmonary hypertension. Gene mutations in EIF2AK4 are often autosomal recessive and directly linked to these conditions. The kinase activity associated with EIF2AK4 is involved in key biological pathways such as the amino acid response (AAR) pathway and the broader ISR pathway, impacting cellular growth, differentiation, and response to nutritional stress. Dysregulation of these pathways has broader implications in cell cycle control and possibly oncogenesis, though direct cancer associations are less clearly defined.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, EIF2AK4 does not have a broad range of directly associated drugs compared to some other genes more typically involved in drug metabolism. However, its role in the stress response pathways might influence the efficacy and toxicity of drugs that induce cellular stress or are influenced by protein synthesis rates. For instance, the kinaseâ€™s role in modulating cellular responses to nutrient depletion could hypothetically interact with the action of mTOR inhibitors used in cancer treatment, such as everolimus and temsirolimus. Additionally, understanding the EIF2AK4 mutations can be crucial for the prognosis and management of PVOD and PCH, influencing treatment plans that might include specific supportive therapies or considerations in the use of vasodilators or anticoagulants.
