## Gene Summary
DHRS1, or Dehydrogenase/Reductase 1, is a gene located on chromosome 14 which encodes an enzyme involved in the metabolism of retinoids, particularly in their reduction. The enzyme expressed by DHRS1 is part of the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) family. These enzymes are known for their role in the oxidation-reduction processes of small molecules. DHRS1 is widely expressed in various tissues including the retina, liver, and kidney, where it plays a crucial role in converting retinal into retinol, a key step in the visual cycle and in maintaining overall retinoid balance within cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
DHRS1 is predominantly associated with the metabolism of retinoids. Retinoids are crucial for vision, growth, cellular differentiation, and proliferation, and apoptosis. Disruptions in retinoid metabolism, potentially involving alterations in DHRS1 activity, can lead to disorders such as retinal dystrophies or impairments in sight. This gene may also have implications in other retinoid-related diseases given its fundamental role in the retinoid metabolic process. As part of the retinol metabolism pathway, DHRS1 impacts several crucial biological pathways including interconversions between different forms of vitamin A.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is limited direct evidence linking DHRS1 with specific pharmacogenetic associations in the context of drug responses or adverse drug reactions. However, considering its role in retinoid metabolism, variation in DHRS1 could hypothetically influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs that interact with vitamin A derivatives. Such drugs include retinoids used in the treatment of acne, like isotretinoin, or in chemotherapy agents derived from vitamin A used for acute promyelocytic leukemia such as tretinoin. Further research may be warranted to explore potential interactions between DHRS1 variants and these drugs' efficacy and toxicity profiles.
