## Gene Summary
OSMR (Oncostatin M Receptor) is a gene that encodes the OSMR beta subunit, part of a receptor for the cytokine oncostatin M. This receptor is a heterodimer composed of OSMR and IL6ST (also known as GP130). The OSMR protein is widely expressed in various tissues, including the heart, skeletal muscle, and skin. The engagement of this receptor by oncostatin M triggers JAK/STAT and MAPK signaling pathways, which are crucial for inflammatory responses and the regulation of cellular growth and differentiation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
OSMR is implicated in several biological pathways including the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, critical for cell growth, survival, and differentiation. Its malfunction has been linked to a range of conditions such as inflammatory diseases and cancer. Specifically, aberrations in OSMR expression or function have been associated with susceptibility to large plaque parapsoriasis and familial amyloidosis. Furthermore, OSMR's modulation of inflammatory and immune responses significantly ties it to conditions like asthma and potentially autoimmune disorders.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of OSMR primarily revolves around its role in mediating responses to cytokine-targeting drugs. Although there are no well-established, widely-recognized drug-gene interactions specifically targeting OSMR, it is a potential therapeutic target in diseases like cancer and inflammatory conditions where the JAK-STAT pathway is a key player. Drugs that influence the JAK-STAT pathway may indirectly affect OSMR functions, possibly modifying the efficacy and safety profiles of these treatments in individuals based on their specific OSMR genetic variants. Research into the pharmacogenetics of OSMR could provide insights relevant to personalized medicine strategies, particularly for therapies aimed at cytokine signaling pathways.
