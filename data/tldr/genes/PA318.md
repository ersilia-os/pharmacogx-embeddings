## Gene Summary
SLC10A2, also known as the Sodium/Bile acid cotransporter 2 or the Apical Sodium-dependent Bile Acid Transporter (ASBT), is fundamentally involved in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. This gene encodes an integral membrane glycoprotein that mediates the sodium-dependent transport of bile acids, particularly conjugated bile acids, into cells. This process mainly occurs in the ileum part of the small intestine and plays crucial roles in maintaining bile acid homeostasis, lipid digestion, and nutrient absorption. The efficient functioning of SLC10A2 is key for re-absorbing bile acids for recycling and excretion, thereby influencing cholesterol levels and metabolic processes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Several diseases and disorders are associated with dysfunction or mutations in SLC10A2, including primary bile acid malabsorption (PBAM) and consequent chronic diarrheal conditions. This gene is also critical in certain metabolic pathways such as the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. Perturbations in these pathways can lead to altered lipid metabolism and impact various other metabolic functions. In terms of drugs, inhibitors of ASBT are being explored as potential treatments for hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and other metabolic disorders by modulating bile acid recycling and thus influencing cholesterol metabolism and glucose homeostasis.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the realm of pharmacogenetics, SLC10A2 shows significant relevance particularly through its influence on the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are bile acid sequestrants or those that can affect bile acid absorption and metabolism. Drugs like cholestyramine or colesevelam, used to lower cholesterol levels, indirectly affect the activity of SLC10A2 by sequestering bile acids in the intestine, thus preventing their reabsorption and prompting increased bile acid synthesis from cholesterol. The genetic variability in SLC10A2 can influence the effectiveness of these treatments, affecting both drug efficacy and the risk of side effects. Understanding these genetic variations is crucial for optimizing therapeutic strategies involving bile acid modulation in metabolic disorders.
