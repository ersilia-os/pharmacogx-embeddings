## Gene Summary
**MYO1H**, or myosin IH, is a gene belonging to the myosin gene family, which encodes a class of actin-binding motor proteins involved in various types of cellular movements, including muscle contraction and intracellular transport. Specific to MYO1H, its expression is notably active in certain tissues, with studies highlighting a more significant presence in epithelial tissues. Myosins typically mediate power stroke motions relative to actin filaments, fundamentally contributing to muscle fiber function and cellular cargo transport. However, the exact physiological roles of MYO1H are still under investigation, with emerging research suggesting roles in cellular signaling and material trafficking within cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
MYO1H has not been extensively studied compared to other myosin proteins, so detailed associations with specific drugs or pathways are not currently well-documented in mainstream pharmacogenetic databases and literature. Preliminary investigations hint at its involvement in specialized cellular processes possibly linked to specific genetic disorders or disease susceptibilities, particularly in contexts where epithelial cell function is disrupted. The association of MYO1H with particular human diseases still remains relatively unexplored, necessitating further genomic and phenotypic studies to elucidate its involvement in human pathology more clearly.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is limited information available regarding the pharmacogenetic implications of MYO1H. Unlike more thoroughly researched genes in the pharmacogenomics field, MYO1H has not yet been linked conclusively with the metabolism, efficacy, or side effects of pharmaceutical drugs. The absence of established data makes it difficult to comment on direct pharmacogenetic associations; however, the continued exploration into the broader myosin family and cellular trafficking pathways may eventually reveal significant relationships between MYO1H gene variants and response to certain treatments, especially those targeting cellular dynamics and muscle function. Future research could potentially uncover noteworthy pharmacogenetic applications that would be valuable for personalized medicine.
