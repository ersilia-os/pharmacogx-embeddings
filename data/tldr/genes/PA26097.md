## Gene Summary
CASR, or the Calcium-Sensing Receptor gene, encodes a G-protein-coupled receptor that plays a critical role in detecting the level of calcium in the body. It is primarily expressed in the parathyroid glands and the kidneys. The receptor's primary function is to regulate parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion and renal calcium excretion in response to fluctuating serum calcium levels. Activation of CASR by elevated extracellular calcium levels inhibits PTH release, thereby decreasing serum calcium concentrations. Conversely, decreased activation by low calcium levels stimulates PTH secretion, helping maintain calcium homeostasis.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The CASR gene is implicated in several calcium-related metabolic disorders. Mutations in CASR can lead to diseases such as Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia (FHH) and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia, both characterized by abnormal calcium homeostasis. FHH typically manifests as mild hypercalcemia with low urinary calcium excretion, whereas mutations leading to an overly active CASR cause hypocalcemia, characterized by low blood calcium levels. Pathways associated with CASR are essential in understanding calcium signaling and homeostasis, which have broader implications in metabolic, neurological, and cardiovascular functions.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic studies of the CASR gene focus primarily on its effects on mineral metabolism and response to drugs used in the treatment of disorders like hyperparathyroidism and osteoporosis. For instance, calcimimetics, such as Cinacalcet, are drugs that mimic the action of calcium on tissues expressing CASR, used effectively to manage secondary hyperparathyroidism, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease. Variations in the CASR gene can influence the efficacy and dosing of calcimimetics. Patients with certain polymorphisms may exhibit different therapeutic outcomes or side effects when treated with such agents due to altered receptor sensitivity. Understanding these pharmacogenomic associations can guide personalized medicine approaches in managing calcium-related disorders.
