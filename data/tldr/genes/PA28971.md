## Gene Summary
GRID2, or Glutamate Ionotropic Receptor Delta Type Subunit 2, is a gene encoding a protein belonging to the delta family of ionotropic glutamate receptors, which are not typically associated with synaptic transmission but are thought to have roles in neurodevelopment and synaptic plasticity. GRID2 is predominantly expressed in the cerebellum, particularly in Purkinje cells, and plays a crucial role in proper functioning of synaptic connections and neuronal signaling in these cells. The receptor's dysfunction is linked with altered motor coordination and potentially with broader neurological impairments.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
GRID2 has been implicated in several neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders. Mutations in this gene are primarily associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 18 (SCA18), a rare disorder characterized by progressive ataxia and poor motor coordination. The gene plays a significant role in the regulation of synaptic pathways including those involving glutamate signaling, a major excitatory neurotransmitter pathway critical for normal brain function. The alterations in GRID2 function or expression can thus influence a range of neural activities, impacting learning, memory, and coordination.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there are limited direct pharmacogenetic associations involving GRID2 with specific drugs. Owing to its key role in neural pathways and glutamate signaling, the research into GRID2 could offer valuable insights into drug responses for conditions affecting the cerebellum and potentially other regions of the brain. Thus, while there are no direct, established pharmacogenetic interactions with defined medications at this point, GRID2 represents a potential target for therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating glutamatergic function, particularly in neurodegenerative and cerebellar disorders. Research into GRID2-related pharmacogenetics is still in the nascent stages and could expand as more is understood about the gene's specific mechanisms and interactions in neuropathological conditions.
