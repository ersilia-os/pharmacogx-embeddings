## Gene Summary
NR1H2, also known as Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1 Group H Member 2, is a gene that encodes the Liver X receptor beta (LXRβ). LXRβ belongs to the nuclear receptor family of intracellular transcription factors and is involved in the regulation of cholesterol, fatty acid, and glucose metabolism. It is predominantly expressed in the liver, kidney, intestine, and adipose tissues. NR1H2 functions together with NR1H3 (LXRα) in controlling the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and transport.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NR1H2 plays a crucial role in various metabolic pathways, particularly those involving lipid metabolism, and has implications in the regulation of inflammatory responses. Dysregulation of NR1H2 activity is associated with metabolic disorders, such as atherosclerosis, obesity, and diabetes. The gene is involved in multiple signaling pathways, including cholesterol homeostasis and reverse cholesterol transport, which are critical in the development of cardiovascular diseases. In addition, NR1H2 influences the transcription of genes related to glucose metabolism, impacting diabetes-related pathways.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of NR1H2 has clinical implications, especially concerning the treatment of lipid disorders and diabetes. Drugs such as synthetic LXR agonists modulate the activity of NR1H2 to target dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. These agonists, including GW3965 and T0901317, are explored for their potential to increase HDL cholesterol and decrease LDL cholesterol by inducing the expression of ABC transporters involved in cholesterol efflux. The gene's polymorphisms might influence individual responses to these LXR agonists, impacting drug efficacy and safety. Furthermore, due to NR1H2's role in inflammation, its pharmacogenetics may extend to drugs targeting inflammatory pathways, although direct associations in clinical settings are yet to be fully established.
