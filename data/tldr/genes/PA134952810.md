## Gene Summary
DHRS3, or Dehydrogenase/Reductase 3, is a key enzyme involved in the metabolism of retinoids, which are compounds chemically related to vitamin A. This gene encodes an enzyme that primarily functions in the reduction of all-trans-retinal to all-trans-retinol in the presence of NADPH. DHRS3 is widely expressed in human tissues, notably in the liver, skin, and cells of the visual system, where retinoid processing is critical. Its activity is pivotal for the maintenance of the normal physiological levels of vitamin A and its derivatives in the body.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
DHRS3 is involved in several biochemical pathways, particularly those linked to the metabolism of vitamin A and its derivatives. The enzyme plays a crucial role in the visual cycle, which is essential for vision. Alterations in the function or expression of DHRS3 can influence retinoid homeostasis which might impact skin conditions, vision-related disorders, and could potentially affect cellular processes like differentiation and proliferation. The gene is also part of the biological pathways that maintain cellular redox balance and response to oxidative stress.

## Pharmacogenetics
Research into the pharmacogenetics of DHRS3 primarily focuses on its role in the metabolism of vitamin A-derived compounds and potentially impacts pharmacological interventions that use these derivatives, such as retinoids used in dermatology and oncology. While specific drug associations are currently not highly detailed in literature, the influence of DHRS3 expression and activity on the efficacy and toxicity of retinoids (e.g., isotretinoin for acne or tretinoin for acute promyelocytic leukemia) represents a promising area. Variation in DHRS3 may affect individual responses to retinoids, possibly influencing drug metabolism, effectiveness, and side-effect profiles, highlighting the need for further research in this area to enable more personalized therapeutic strategies.
