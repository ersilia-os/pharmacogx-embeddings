## Gene Summary
TUBB3, or Tubulin Beta 3 Class III, is a gene encoding a specific isotype of beta tubulin, which is a major component of microtubules. This protein is critically involved in cell structure and movement, intracellular transport mechanisms, and the formation and maintenance of various cellular structures, including the mitotic spindle during cell division. TUBB3 is predominantly expressed in neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems and is essential for proper axon guidance and maintenance. It plays a crucial role in neurodevelopment and is involved in regulating the growth and development of neurons through its impact on microtubule dynamics.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
TUBB3 has been implicated in several neurodevelopmental and neurological conditions. Mutations in this gene have been associated with congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 3, a rare autosomal dominant congenital disorder affecting the muscles that control eye movement. This may lead to restricted eye movement, ptosis, and strabismus. Furthermore, TUBB3 is involved in pathways related to microtubule dynamics essential for cellular processes such as cell division and intracellular trafficking. Due to its critical function in nerve cells, it is also relevant in studies of neural disorders and neuronal recovery after injury.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, TUBB3 has gained attention for its involvement in cancer pharmacology, particularly in the context of resistance to microtubule-targeting agents. Expression of TUBB3 has been linked to resistance against taxanes (such as paclitaxel and docetaxel) and vinca alkaloids (such as vincristine), which are commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs that target microtubules. High levels of TUBB3 expression have been identified as a potential marker for reduced efficacy of these drugs in treating cancers like ovarian and non-small cell lung cancer. Accordingly, TUBB3 expression could be a critical factor in tailoring personalized cancer treatments and in the development of new therapeutic strategies that can overcome drug resistance linked with TUBB3.
