## Gene Summary
ANGPTL3, or angiopoietin-like 3, is a protein-coding gene that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism. It is primarily involved in the regulation of triglyceride levels in the plasma by inhibiting the activity of lipoprotein lipase and endothelial lipase. ANGPTL3 is produced predominantly in the liver and secreted into the bloodstream. The protein encoded by this gene is part of the angiopoietin-like protein family, which is characterized by its similarity to angiopoietins in terms of structure but not function, as it does not typically bind to angiopoietin receptors.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ANGPTL3 has been associated with several lipid metabolism disorders, particularly those involving abnormalities in cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Mutations and variants in this gene have been linked to familial combined hypolipidemia and hyperlipidemia. Furthermore, the gene has been of interest in studies related to cardiovascular diseases due to its significant role in regulating lipid profiles, which are critical in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. Pathways involving ANGPTL3 include lipid metabolism and regulation pathways, with interactions that impact the processing of lipids and their subsequent use or storage in the body.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, ANGPTL3 is notable for its implications in the effectiveness and response to several lipid-lowering therapies. Inhibitors targeting ANGPTL3, such as evinacumab, have been researched and developed due to the protein's role in lipid homeostasis. Evinacumab, specifically, has shown effectiveness in lowering cholesterol levels in individuals with genetic variants affecting ANGPTL3 function, highlighting a key pharmacogenetic association. This is particularly relevant in cases of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) where traditional treatments are not sufficiently effective. Thus, ANGPTL3 represents a therapeutic target for novel interventions in lipid disorders, with pharmacogenetic variations significantly influencing treatment outcomes.
