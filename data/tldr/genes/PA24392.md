## Gene Summary
ABCC10, also known as Multidrug Resistance Protein 7 (MRP7), is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. These transporters play a crucial role in the cellular efflux of various substances, including drugs and xenobiotics, across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. ABCC10 is predominantly expressed in the liver, kidney, and intestine, tissues known for their roles in detoxification and drug excretion. The protein is implicated in the transport of a wide array of substrates, particularly conjugated organic anions.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ABCC10 is primarily associated with the cellular resistance mechanisms against chemotherapeutic agents. Its expression and function are significant in the context of cancer treatment, as it is known to confer resistance to a variety of antineoplastic drugs, including taxanes and vinca alkaloids. Moreover, research suggests a link between ABCC10 and altered drug pharmacokinetics, influencing drug disposition and efficacy. The pathways involving ABCC10 are integral to pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, influencing the absorption, distribution, and elimination of drugs.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of ABCC10 is crucial in the context of chemotherapy resistance. Variations in this gene can affect the efficacy and toxicity of anti-cancer drugs. For instance, polymorphisms in ABCC10 have been studied for their potential to alter drug transport activity and thereby modify the clinical response to agents such as paclitaxel and docetaxel, common chemotherapeutic drugs used in the treatment of various cancers. Understanding the genetic variations of ABCC10 can guide dosage adjustments and choice of therapy, aiming to enhance therapeutic efficacy and minimize adverse drug reactions. Thus, ABCC10 serves as a potential biomarker for predicting responses to chemotherapy and could be a target for enhancing drug delivery to tumor cells.
