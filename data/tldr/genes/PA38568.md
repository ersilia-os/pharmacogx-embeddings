## Gene Summary
KMT2E (lysine methyltransferase 2E), previously known as MLL5, encodes a member of the lysine methyltransferase family associated with chromatin regulation and transcription. KMT2E is widely studied for its role in the methylation of histone H3, specifically contributing to the monomethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me1), a marker that is predominantly associated with enhancer regions of the genome. The gene is expressed in various tissues, with particular relevance in hematopoietic cells. KMT2E has been implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cell functions.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
KMT2E is implicated in various biological pathways including chromatin modification and gene expression regulation which are critical for cell differentiation and proliferation. Dysregulation of KMT2E has been linked to several hematological disorders, underlining its importance in the development and progression of diseases such as leukemia. It also plays a role in the epigenetic regulation of genes involved in immune responses and metabolic processes. Phenotypically, alterations in KMT2E expression or function can influence cell fate decisions and potentially contribute to developmental abnormalities and cancer.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of KMT2E is an emerging field, where most of the focus has been on understanding its roles in disease rather than direct interactions with specific drugs. However, given its role in regulating chromatin states and influencing the expression of genes involved in cell survival and proliferation, agents targeting epigenetic modifications may indirectly affect KMT2E function. For example, inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases or histone deacetylases used in the treatment of hematological malignancies might have downstream effects on KMT2E-mediated pathways. The specific interactions and implications of KMT2E in the context of direct drug targeting and response require further investigation to elucidate potential pharmacogenetic applications.
