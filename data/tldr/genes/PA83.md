## Gene Summary
CACNA1C stands for calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 C. It encodes a protein that is an essential part of the L-type calcium channels (LTCC), which are critical for various physiological functions particularly in cardiac muscle, where these channels influence action potentials and hence muscle contraction. CACNA1C is highly expressed in the heart and is also present in other tissues including the brain where it influences neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release. Mutations and alternative splicing of this gene have been associated with alterations in channel function and expression, influencing cellular and physiological processes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CACNA1C is implicated in several cardiovascular disorders, notably Timothy syndrome and Brugada syndrome. These conditions are characterized by abnormal heart rhythms, which can be life-threatening. The gene also plays a role in psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, likely due to its influence on brain calcium channel functioning. Pathways associated with CACNA1C include calcium signaling and cardiac conduction pathways, highlighting its role in electrophysiological stability within cardiac and neural cells.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenomic profile of CACNA1C highlights its influence on the efficacy and safety of various drugs. Notably, drugs that affect calcium channel functionality such as verapamil and nifedipine (calcium channel blockers) are impacted by variations in this gene. These drugs are commonly used in the treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular disorders. Genetic variations in CACNA1C can alter drug response, potentially requiring dosage adjustments or alternative therapies to avoid adverse effects or suboptimal treatment outcomes. Studies have shown significant associations between certain polymorphisms in CACNA1C and the risk of drug-induced cardiac arrhythmias, supporting the need for personalized medicine approaches in patients receiving calcium channel blockers.
