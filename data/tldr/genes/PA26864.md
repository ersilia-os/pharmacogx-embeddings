## Gene Summary
CREB1 (cAMP Responsive Element Binding Protein 1) is a transcription factor that is a member of the leucine zipper family. It is pivotal in the cellular response to hormonal stimulation and regulates numerous physiological processes. CREB1 binds to specific DNA sequences called cAMP response elements (CRE), leading to increased or decreased transcription of downstream genes. This gene plays a key role in a variety of cellular processes including the survival of neurons, synaptic plasticity in the brain, and adaptation to metabolic stress.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CREB1 has been implicated in several pathways related to memory formation, addiction, and the cellular stress response. It is significant in the neurobiology of disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, and Bipolar disorder. CREB1's role in mediating cellular stress responses also ties it to cancer biology, particularly in contexts where cell survival is dysregulated. Mutations and dysregulation of CREB1 have been observed in some cases of acute leukemia and solid tumors.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic implications of CREB1 are mainly explored in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders and response to psychotropic drugs. Its role in synaptic plasticity makes it a potential pharmacological target in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction and mood disorders. Drugs that modulate the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway indirectly influence the activity of CREB1, potentially altering treatment outcomes in depressive disorders and affecting neuroprotection and neurogenesis. CREB1 has also been studied in addiction, suggesting that modulation of this gene might influence the response to therapies aimed at reducing addiction behaviors.
