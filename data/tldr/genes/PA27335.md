## Gene Summary
DIAPH3 (Diaphanous Related Formin 3) is a gene that encodes a member of the diaphanous-related formin family. These proteins are involved in remodeling the cytoskeleton to affect changes in cell shape and migration. DIAPH3 is specifically implicated in the regulation of actin polymerization, influencing processes such as axon guidance, neuronal branching, and cell motility. DIAPH3 functions by controlling actin filament nucleation and elongation. Expression of DIAPH3 is ubiquitous but notable for its role in neuronal cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
DIAPH3 has been studied for its association with various cellular pathways and phenotypes, predominantly those involving cellular structure and movement. While direct drug interactions are not prominently documented, the gene plays a critical role in diseases such as auditory neuropathy and other neuron-related disorders due to its function in the nervous system. Pathways influenced by DIAPH3 include those integral to actin cytoskeleton regulation and cell migration, essential for developmental processes and cellular response to external stimuli.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, DIAPH3 does not have a direct, well-documented association with specific drug responses or pharmacological interactions. Most of the gene's significance in medicine stems from its role in disease mechanisms rather than drug metabolism or drug efficacy pathways. However, understanding variations in DIAPH3 could potentially inform conditions like auditory neuropathy spectral disorders, suggesting a more indirect relevance to therapeutic approaches or prognostic assessments in neurology and developmental biology.
