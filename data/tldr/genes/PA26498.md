## Gene Summary
CHRNE, or cholinergic receptor nicotinic epsilon subunit, is a crucial component of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) located in the neuromuscular junction. These receptor complexes are involved in muscle contraction following neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) binding. CHRNE specifically forms part of the muscle-type nAChRs, which are pentameric structures typically made up of alpha (α), beta (β), gamma (γ), delta (δ), and epsilon (ε) subunits; in adult muscles, epsilon replaces the gamma subunit. The $\epsilon$ subunit encoded by CHRNE is essential for proper receptor assembly and function, influencing both ligand binding and ion channel activity.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The CHRNE gene is primarily associated with congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS), a group of disorders characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue. Mutations in the CHRNE gene disrupt the normal function of the acetylcholine receptors, leading to impaired neuromuscular transmission. These mutations can result in various CMS phenotypes, often presenting symptoms from birth or early childhood, including eyelid ptosis, limb weakness, and respiratory difficulties. The CHRNE gene's role in these pathways underscores its critical function in neuromuscular signaling and muscular mechanics.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, the CHRNE gene's relevance primarily pertains to the treatment of disorders like CMS, where tailored therapy can be crucial. Given the role of CHRNE-encoded protein in CMS, drugs targeting the neuromuscular junction, such as cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., pyridostigmine), are often used to ameliorate symptoms by increasing acetylcholine concentration at the synaptic cleft, thus enhancing receptor activation. However, the effectiveness and side effects of these treatments can vary depending on the specific CHRNE mutations present, highlighting the importance of genetic diagnosis in guiding therapy choices. Such personalized approaches can optimize therapeutic efficacy and minimize adverse effects, demonstrating the significant impact of CHRNE pharmacogenetics in clinical settings.
