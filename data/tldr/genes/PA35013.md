## Gene Summary
SCO2, officially known as synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase 2, is crucial in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), which is part of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex. It is particularly involved in the copper delivery system essential for COX activity. Mutations in SCO2 lead primarily to the disruption of mitochondrial function, impacting cellular energy production. SCO2 is expressed in various tissues, predominantly in those with high energetic demands such as the heart and brain.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SCO2 mutations are closely associated with a rare autosomal recessive condition known as fatal infantile cardioencephalomyopathy due to cytochrome c oxidase deficiency. This disease manifests early in infancy with symptoms such as hypotonia, cardiomyopathy, and neurological impairment, typically resulting in early death. The phenotypic consequences include lactic acidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. SCO2 plays a role in mitochondrial energy production pathways, influencing cellular energy mechanisms and the maintenance of metabolic processes.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there is a limited scope in the direct pharmacogenetics involving SCO2, primarily because the geneâ€™s role is more pivotal in the congenital and biochemical development rather than interacting with pharmaceutical agents. Most therapeutic approaches to conditions associated with SCO2 mutations are supportive rather than curative, focusing on managing symptoms rather than addressing the genetic root cause. Nonetheless, understanding SCO2's interactions and its mitochondrial functions might inform future targeted therapies or interventions that mitigate the effects of its dysfunction. Research into mitochondrial enhancers or specific gene therapy might offer avenues for pharmacogenetic exploration in the future.
