## Gene Summary
F2R, also known as the coagulation factor II receptor or PAR1 (protease-activated receptor 1), is a gene that encodes for a protein involved in the coagulation cascade which ultimately contributes to thrombin signaling and platelet activation. F2R belongs to a family of G-protein coupled receptors that are activated through the cleavage of their extracellular N-terminus by serine proteases. The F2R protein plays a central role in hemostasis, inflammation, and wound healing. It is widely expressed in a variety of tissues including platelets, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
F2R is primarily associated with the regulation of thrombin signaling in platelets, influencing blood coagulation and vascular integrity. Dysregulation or genetic variations in F2R can contribute to various cardiovascular disorders such as thrombosis and atherosclerosis. Pathologically, mutations or altered expression of F2R have been implicated in increased risk of arterial and venous thromboses. The gene is part of critical signaling pathways that also involve interactions with other coagulation factors, which modulates cellular responses to vascular injury and inflammation.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, F2R is of interest primarily in the context of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy. Drugs targeting the thrombin receptor such as vorapaxar, a PAR1 antagonist, are influenced by the genetic variations in F2R. Vorapaxar specifically is used to reduce thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with a history of myocardial infarction or with peripheral arterial disease. Genetic differences in F2R may affect the efficacy and safety of such treatments, potentially influencing drug response variability among individuals. Understanding these genetic associations helps in tailoring personalized therapeutic strategies, potentially improving clinical outcomes in the management of thrombotic disorders.
