## Gene Summary
CYP11B1, short for Cytochrome P450 Family 11 Subfamily B Member 1, is a gene that encodes a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of corticosteroids. CYP11B1 specifically catalyzes the 11-beta-hydroxylation of 11-deoxycorticosterone to form corticosterone in the adrenal gland. This step is crucial in the production of aldosterone and cortisol, which are essential for fluid and electrolyte balance, as well as the stress response in the body. The gene is primarily expressed in the adrenal cortex, particularly in the zona fasciculata and zona glomerulosa.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The CYP11B1 gene plays a significant role in endocrine and metabolic pathways related to steroidogenesis. Mutations in this gene can lead to disorders such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, specifically the 11-Beta-hydroxylase deficiency. This condition is characterized by hypertension and an excess production of androgenic steroids. Moreover, the enzymatic activity of CYP11B1 influences the physiological variations in steroid hormone synthesis, impacting various aspects of human health including stress response, immune function, and metabolism.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of CYP11B1 predominantly concerns the modulation of this enzyme's activity through various compounds that might affect corticosteroid levels. Known inhibitors of CYP11B1, such as metyrapone, are used in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders like Cushing's syndrome by reducing corticosteroid production. Furthermore, understanding individual variations in the CYP11B1 gene can help predict responses to these inhibitors, aiding in personalized treatment strategies. This gene's role in drug metabolism and its potential genetic variations can significantly impact pharmacotherapy in endocrine disorders.
