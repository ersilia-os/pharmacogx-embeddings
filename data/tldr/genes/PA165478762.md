## Gene Summary
DCAF4, or DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 4, is a gene implicated in the process of protein ubiquitination, a critical mechanism for protein degradation and regulation within the cell. DCAF4 functions primarily as a substrate receptor for CUL4-RING ubiquitin ligase complexes, playing a part in various cellular functions including DNA repair, replication, and signaling pathways, by mediating the ubiquitination of specific protein substrates. The gene is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, indicating its fundamental role in maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
DCAF4 has been linked to cellular mechanisms that could potentially influence the development of certain diseases, though direct associations with specific conditions are still under exploration. In research models, alterations in the regulation of ubiquitin ligase complexes, to which DCAF4 contributes, have been associated with cancer progression, suggesting a role in tumor suppressor networks and oncogenic pathways. The pathways involving DCAF4 include those related to proteasomal degradation, highlighting its potential importance in protein quality control systems within the cell.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there are no direct pharmacogenetic associations involving DCAF4 that influence drug response or drug metabolism in a clinically significant manner. While DCAF4's role in protein ubiquitination may indirectly suggest its involvement in the pharmacodynamics of drugs that target proteasome functions, such as bortezomib used in cancer therapy, specific interactions involving DCAF4 and these drugs have not been definitively established. Ongoing research into the pharmacogenetics of ubiquitin ligase complex components may reveal more about potential drug-gene interactions and their clinical implications in the future.
