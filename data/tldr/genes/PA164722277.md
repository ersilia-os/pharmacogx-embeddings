## Gene Summary
METTL14, or Methyltransferase Like 14, is a core component of the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase complex. This complex plays a critical role in the methylation of adenosine residues within RNA transcripts, influencing RNA stability, splicing, and processing. METTL14 works alongside METTL3, another methyltransferase, to catalyze the m6A modification, which is the most common internal modification among mRNAs and non-coding RNAs. This gene is vital in various biological processes, including development and differentiation, and it is broadly expressed in human tissues.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The function of METTL14 impacts several key cellular pathways and physiological processes. The m6A modification mediated by METTL14 has been implicated in regulating gene expression critical during developmental processes, stress responses, immune function, and cancer progression. Disruption in the normal functioning of METTL14 is associated with numerous diseases, particularly cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  This gene plays a role in modulating the cell cycle, apoptosis, and proliferation pathways, explaining its significant implications in oncogenesis.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the realm of pharmacogenetics, METTL14's role in modifying RNA and thus influencing gene expression places it as a potential target in disease treatments, especially in cancer. However, specific drug associations and personalized medicine applications based on METTL14 genetic variations are still in early exploratory stages. Given its crucial role in the pathophysiology of cancers like AML, drugs targeting the m6A RNA methylation pathway involving METTL14 could be highly significant. Ongoing research is necessary to establish concrete pharmacogenomic relationships and to potentially develop targeted therapies aimed at modulating the enzymatic activity of the METTL14 and its complex.
