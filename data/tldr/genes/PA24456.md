## Gene Summary
ACTA2 (Actin, Alpha 2, Smooth Muscle, Aorta) encodes the alpha-2 isoform of smooth muscle actin, which is a major contractile protein converting chemical energy into mechanical motion. ACTA2 is primarily expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and is involved in various cellular processes including muscle contraction, cell motility, and maintenance of cell shape and junctions. Mutations in ACTA2 are notably associated with several vascular diseases, reflecting its critical role in vascular smooth muscle function and structure.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ACTA2 mutations are closely linked to an array of vascular pathologies, notably thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAAD), which underscore its crucial role in maintaining aortic integrity. The gene also has implications in other vascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, stroke, and Moyamoya disease. Phenotypically, disruptions in ACTA2 can lead to altered contractility and structural integrity of vascular smooth muscle, impacting arterial stiffness and responsiveness. ACTA2 operates within the pathway of smooth muscle contraction and interacts with a variety of proteins involved in this pathway, influencing both muscle tone and blood pressure regulation.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics aspect of ACTA2 is mostly linked to its influence on the efficacy and safety of drugs used in the management of cardiovascular diseases, although no direct associations with specific drugs have been robustly established due to the structural rather than enzymatic role of the protein. However, understanding ACTA2 mutations can help predict the progression of vascular diseases, potentially influencing therapeutic decisions regarding the use of antihypertensives, anticoagulants, and surgical interventions. Precision in genetic profiling of ACTA2 could therefore contribute to optimized patient-specific management plans in vascular pathologies.
