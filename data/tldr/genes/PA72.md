## Gene Summary
ATP7A, also known as ATPase Copper Transporting Alpha, is a gene that encodes a copper-transporting P-type ATPase. This enzyme is involved in the cellular transport of copper and is essential for processes such as iron metabolism, melanin production, and the development and maintenance of the nervous system. The ATP7A protein helps to distribute copper to copper-dependent enzymes and exports excess copper out of cells, thereby preventing toxicity. It is predominantly expressed in the small intestine, kidney, liver, lung, and brain, playing a key role in copper absorption and homeostasis throughout the body.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in ATP7A are associated with Menkes disease, a disorder characterized by copper deficiency that leads to severe developmental issues, neurological degeneration, and connective tissue disorders. Additionally, allelic variants of ATP7A have been linked to occipital horn syndrome and distal motor neuropathy, which are less severe conditions related to copper metabolism. These diseases all portray a spectrum of copper transport issues ranging from severe to mild phenotypes. The gene is involved in several biological pathways including copper homeostasis and ATP synthesis coupled electron transport. Its function and implications also extend to areas in developmental biology and neurology due to the broad effects of copper in neuronal health and development.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic implications of ATP7A are predominantly related to its role in copper transport and metabolism, influencing treatment approaches for conditions caused by ATP7A mutations. For Menkes disease and other copper metabolism disorders, strategies often involve copper supplementation or chelation therapy. The response to these treatments can be influenced by the specific nature of the ATP7A mutation present, indicating a pharmacogenetic angle to their management. This underscores the importance of genetic analysis and personalized medicine approaches in the management and treatment of these conditions. However, specific drug interactions guided by ATP7A genetic variants are not widely reported in the literature, suggesting a more foundational than direct role in pharmacogenetics focused on copper modulation treatments.
