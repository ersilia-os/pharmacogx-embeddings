## Gene Summary
VEGFA (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A) is a critical protein involved in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, the processes of blood vessel formation from endothelial cells. It is expressed in a variety of tissue types and plays a pivotal role in both physiological and pathological processes. VEGFA functions primarily by binding to its receptors, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, on the surface of endothelial cells, triggering a cascade of downstream signaling that promotes cell proliferation, migration, and new blood vessel formation. Aberrant expression or regulation of VEGFA is linked to several pathological conditions, including cancerous tumor growth and metastasis.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
VEGFA is associated with numerous drugs and therapies, particularly in the treatment of cancers and ophthalmologic conditions like age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy, where abnormal blood vessel growth needs to be controlled. It is also implicated in several diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and other inflammatory and ischemic conditions. The VEGFA pathways include signaling processes that regulate vascular permeability, endothelial cell growth, and survival. The gene's involvement in angiogenesis makes it a critical focus in tumor growth and cardiovascular diseases, where angiogenesis can have both beneficial and detrimental effects.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, VEGFA is notable for its association with the efficacy and toxicity of anti-angiogenic drugs, primarily used in cancer therapy. Drugs such as bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against VEGFA, used in the treatment of several types of cancer including colorectal, lung, breast, glioblastoma, and kidney cancers, are influenced by variations in the VEGFA gene. Research indicates that polymorphisms in VEGFA can affect how patients respond to these treatments, potentially influencing outcomes and side-effect profiles. For instance, certain VEGFA polymorphisms are associated with variability in response and adverse effects to therapies targeting VEGF pathways, highlighting the need for personalized treatment approaches based on VEGFA genetic profiles.
