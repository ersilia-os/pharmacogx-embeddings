## Gene Summary 
TBL1XR1 (Transducin Beta-Like 1 X-Linked Receptor 1) is a gene involved in transcriptional regulation and signal transduction. It encodes a component of the SMRT/N-CoR corepressor complex, which is critical for mediating transcriptional repression by certain transcription factors. TBL1XR1 also assists in the exchange of corepressor complexes for coactivator complexes, thus playing a pivotal role in gene expression dynamics. The gene is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, indicating its fundamental role in cellular processes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
TBL1XR1 is implicated in several cancer types, notably in hematologic malignancies such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Its function in repressing or activating transcription links it directly to cellular pathways that control proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation, which are often disrupted in cancer. Moreover, its interaction with nuclear receptors and involvement in the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway further associate TBL1XR1 with inflammatory responses and immune regulation.

## Pharmacogenetics
There are limited specific pharmacogenetic studies focusing exclusively on TBL1XR1. However, its role in cancer biology, particularly through affecting transcription and the NF-κB pathway, provides an indirect association with therapies targeting these routes, such as corticosteroids or inhibitors of NF-κB signaling in neoplastic conditions. Given TBL1XR1's role in protein complexes that govern gene silencing, drugs modulating chromatin structure and function could theoretically be influenced by variations in this gene, although specific associations have yet to be robustly documented in pharmacogenetic contexts.
