## Gene Summary
ATAT1, standing for Alpha tubulin acetyltransferase 1, is a key enzyme responsible for the acetylation of alpha-tubulin. This modification occurs on lysine 40 of alpha-tubulin and is crucial for the proper function and stability of microtubules, which play an essential role in maintaining cell structure, intracellular transport, and cell division. ATAT1 is expressed in a variety of tissues, reflecting the ubiquitous need for microtubule functions in cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The enzymatic activity of ATAT1 impacts several biological pathways, primarily those associated with microtubule dynamics and cellular transport. Dysregulation of ATAT1 expression or mutation could potentially affect neurological functions and has been suggested in studies to have implications in neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Furthermore, its role in cell division associates it with potential implications in cancer biology, particularly in the context of cell proliferation and metastasis.

## Pharmacogenetics
Current pharmacogenetic insights into ATAT1 mainly revolve around its implication in disease states rather than direct interactions with specific drugs. No direct pharmacogenetic associations have been comprehensively established, meaning specific drugs that modify ATAT1 activity or expression are yet to be characterized in clinical settings. However, the exploration of microtubule-targeting agents, commonly used in cancer therapy, may indirectly relate to the function of ATAT1, suggesting a potential area for future pharmacogenetic research.
