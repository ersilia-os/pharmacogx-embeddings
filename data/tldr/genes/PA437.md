## Gene Summary
CD96, also known as T-cell surface protein tactile, is a membrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. It is primarily expressed on the surface of T cells and plays a role in immune regulation. CD96 functions in cell adhesion, interaction between T cells and other cell types, and is involved in mediating immune responses. The activation and binding of CD96 can influence T-cell activation and cytotoxicity, highlighting its role in surveilling and responding to cellular stress or malignancy.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CD96 is associated with the functioning and regulation of the immune system. Its interactions and pathways are primarily connected with immune response mechanisms. There is growing interest in its relatedness to autoimmune diseases and cancers, particularly due to its role in T-cell activation and cytotoxic responses. CD96 is being studied for its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology, aiming to enhance immune responses against tumor cells. In terms of pathways, CD96 is important in various signaling pathways related to immune cell activation and adhesion processes.

## Pharmacogenetics
While there is significant biomedical interest in CD96, particularly concerning its potential importance in cancer immunotherapy, specific pharmacogenetic associations with particular drugs are not extensively documented as of current knowledge. Nevertheless, the exploration into inhibiting or modulating CD96 interactions or expression as an immunotherapeutic approach in cancer treatment suggests a potential area for pharmacogenetic research. Understanding genetic variations in CD96 might eventually guide the development of targeted therapies that could enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapies by modifying the immune system's response to tumor cells. However, more detailed and extensive research is needed to establish concrete pharmacogenetic profiles and associations.
