## Gene Summary
The gene *ACE* (Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme) is vital in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which regulates blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte balance. The encoded enzyme, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is key in converting angiotensin I to the active vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. ACE is a zinc metalloprotease found primarily on the endothelial cells of the lungs but has a widespread tissue distribution. The enzyme also inactivates bradykinin, a potent vasodilator, thereby influencing vascular tone and blood pressure.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The *ACE* gene is directly implicated in the modulation and treatment of cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. The regulation of this enzyme is a primary target of ACE inhibitors, a major class of antihypertensive drugs. This gene is also associated with various phenotypes such as blood pressure response to physical stimuli and circulating levels of specific biomarkers related to cardiovascular health. Pathways associated with *ACE* include the renin-angiotensin system and various signaling pathways impacting cardiovascular functions.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of *ACE* is primarily linked to the efficacy and potential side effects of ACE inhibitors, such as lisinopril, enalapril, and ramipril. Variations in the *ACE* gene, such as the presence of an insertion (I) or deletion (D) allele in the *ACE* Alu polymorphism, influence the serum and cellular levels of the enzyme and subsequently impact drug efficacy. For instance, individuals with the DD genotype might exhibit a different therapeutic response or increased risk of side effects compared to those with the II genotype. Additionally, genetic variants of *ACE* have been studied for associations with differential outcomes in cardiovascular and renal diseases in the context of ACE inhibitor treatment.
