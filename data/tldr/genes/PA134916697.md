## Gene Summary
RFK, or riboflavin kinase, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the metabolism of riboflavin (vitamin B2) into flavin mononucleotide (FMN), which is a crucial step in the synthesis of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). These flavin coenzymes are essential for a variety of biological processes, including electron transport in mitochondrial respiration. RFK is expressed in various tissues but shows higher expression levels in metabolic tissues such as the heart and skeletal muscle. The human RFK gene is located on chromosome 9q21.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
RFK is intricately linked to metabolic pathways involving vitamins and essential nutrients. Deficiencies in RFK or disruptions in its activity can lead to conditions associated with impaired energy metabolism, such as multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenation deficiency (MADD), although direct causal relationships may be complex and involve multiple genetic and environmental factors. Pharmacologically, there is interest in RFK's role in modulating cellular concentrations of flavins, which are potential targets in metabolic and mitochondrial disorders.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of RFK largely relate to its role in the metabolism of vitamin B2 and its derivatives. While not directly associated with specific drugs, its metabolic role can influence the efficacy and toxicity of drugs that interact with mitochondrial function or those requiring flavin coenzymes. Indirectly, variants in RFK could affect drug response in treatments involving energy metabolism, potentially impacting the management of metabolic disorders. Currently, there are no direct pharmacogenetic associations involving specific RFK inhibitors or modulators, but knowledge of RFK activity could be relevant in the context of broader metabolic support or supplementation strategies in clinical settings.
