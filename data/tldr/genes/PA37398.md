## Gene Summary
WWOX, or WW domain-containing oxidoreductase, is a gene that plays critical roles in several cellular processes including apoptosis, metabolism, and gene expression regulation. WWOX is known for its involvement in tumor suppression by modulating pathways that influence cell cycle and survival. The gene encodes a protein that contains two WW domains, which are protein-interaction modules interacting with proline-rich peptide motifs, and a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase domain. This gene is widely expressed in various tissues, but particularly in hormonally regulated tissues such as the testis and ovary.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
WWOX is implicated in the development and progression of multiple types of cancers, including breast, prostate, and ovarian cancers. Its role in these diseases primarily revolves around its tumor suppressor functions; loss or alteration of WWOX expression is often associated with increased tumorigenesis. Besides cancer, mutations in WWOX have also been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 and epilepsy. The WWOX protein is involved in various signaling pathways, including those related to steroid hormone signaling and apoptosis, underlining its broad physiological importance.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, WWOXâ€™s relevance is largely investigational and centers on its potential impact on cancer treatment outcomes. Although direct associations with specific drugs have not been robustly established, the modulation of WWOX expression or activity could theoretically influence the effectiveness or toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents, particularly those that target pathways involving cell apoptosis and survival. Research in pharmacogenetics continues to explore how variations in WWOX expression or function could be used to personalize treatment strategies for cancer patients, potentially predicting responses to chemotherapy or targeted therapeutic agents.
