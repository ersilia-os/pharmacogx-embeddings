## Gene Summary
ALK, or Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase, is a receptor tyrosine kinase which plays a key role in the development of the brain and exerts its effects on specific neurons in the nervous system. It is largely involved in brain development, affecting the growth and differentiation of neurons. Generally, ALK expression is higher during embryonic stages and declines after birth. The gene is located on chromosome 2p23 and contains a variety of domains essential for enzymatic activity and mediating cellular signaling.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ALK mutations and translocations are known to be involved in the development of various types of cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and neuroblastoma. Notably, the EML4-ALK fusion gene is a significant driver in subsets of NSCLC. ALK is also implicated in rare conditions like congenital fibrosarcoma and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. The signaling pathways associated with ALK include the PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT, and RAS/MAPK pathways, which are crucial in cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of ALK revolves predominantly around its role in oncology, especially in NSCLC. Drugs targeting ALK such as crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, and lorlatinib are used to treat cancers with ALK rearrangements. These ALK inhibitors have significantly improved outcomes in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. The response to these drugs can be influenced by various mutations within the ALK gene; for instance, some mutations confer resistance to crizotinib but may remain sensitive to newer inhibitors like brigatinib and lorlatinib. Testing for ALK gene rearrangements is now a standard component of the diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making process in NSCLC, underscoring the importance of ALK in pharmacogenetics.
