## Gene Summary
EPO, or erythropoietin, is a gene that encodes a glycoprotein hormone important primarily for the production of red blood cells. This protein regulates erythropoiesis, stimulating the division and differentiation of committed erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow. It is predominantly produced by the kidneys in adults, with minor amounts being produced by the liver. The expression of EPO can be upregulated in response to hypoxia or low oxygen levels, mediated by oxygen-sensing proteins. This feedback mechanism ensures adequate oxygen transport capacity of the blood.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
EPO is therapeutically significant and is leveraged in the treatment of diseases like anemia, particularly those associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD), cancer, and in therapeutic protocols involving bone marrow transplantation or other cytotoxic treatments. Its dysregulation or misuse can result in conditions like polycythemia, a condition characterized by an excess of red blood cells. The gene operates within multiple pathways, including erythropoietin-mediated signaling pathways and the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, both essential for the mediation of cellular survival, proliferation, and differentiation responses.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacologically, recombinant forms of EPO such as epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa are widely used in clinical practice to treat anemia without the need for blood transfusion dependency. Pharmacogenetic factors influence the effectiveness and safety of EPO therapy, impacting individual responses and risk of complications like hypertension or thrombosis. Individual genetic variations in EPO and its receptor EPOR, along with other genes involved in iron metabolism and erythropoiesis, can affect hemoglobin targets and dosing requirements. Moreover, genetic variations might also modify the risk of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent-associated adverse outcomes, guiding personalized treatment plans to optimize efficacy and minimize risks.
