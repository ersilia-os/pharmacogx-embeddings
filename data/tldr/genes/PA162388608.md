## Gene Summary
FKBP15, also known as FK506 binding protein 15, is involved in immunoregulation and basic cellular processes involving protein folding and trafficking. This gene's protein product is a member of the immunophilin protein family, which plays a role in immunoregulation and basic cellular processes involving protein folding and trafficking. FKBP15 is known for its interactions with several intracellular signaling proteins and receptors, and it possesses a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity that contributes to its role in folding of proteins within the cell.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Although FKBP15 is not as extensively studied in terms of direct associations with specific diseases or drugs as some other genes in the FKBP family, its function suggests potential relevance in disorders involving protein misfolding and cellular trafficking abnormalities. The gene's involvement in signaling pathways can imply a role in immune response and potentially in autoimmune disorders or inflammatory conditions. Its expression and functional activities suggest it may have implications in neurological disorders where protein folding is a known issue.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of FKBP15 are not as well-documented as more commonly studied genes related to drug metabolism and efficacy, like CYP family genes. Thus far, there are limited studies directly linking FKBP15 with specific pharmacogenetic effects in terms of drug response or interaction. The protein's role in cellular processes, however, suggests that understanding its interactions could eventually lead to insights into how drugs influencing cellular machinery might be moderated or have their efficacy altered by FKBP15's activity. Future research could potentially explore how variations in this gene affect drug responses, particularly in the context of treatments involving immunosuppressive agents or therapies aimed at protein folding disorders.
