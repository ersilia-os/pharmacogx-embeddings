## Gene Summary
USP24, or Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 24, is a gene involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This gene encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a critical role in ubiquitin-dependent processes, essential for protein degradation, cell cycle regulation, and stress response. USP24 is known for its ability to remove ubiquitin from specific protein substrates, thereby altering their degradation process, cellular localization, and activity. The expression of USP24 is variable but has been detected in multiple tissues indicating a broad physiological role.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
USP24 has been associated with numerous biological pathways and functions primarily related to protein homeostasis and cell cycle regulation. Disruptions in USP24 functions are linked with various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancers. The enzyme's role in removing ubiquitin from histone proteins suggests its involvement in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation, which can influence developmental processes and tumor suppressive pathways. Research suggests a connection between USP24 mutations or expression levels and the pathogenesis of certain phenotypes of depression and bipolar disorder.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of USP24 is an emerging field, with ongoing studies investigating how variations in this gene affect drug response and toxicity. While specific drugs directly associated with USP24 have not yet been robustly identified, understanding its general role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system suggests potential implications for drugs targeting proteostasis, such as proteasome inhibitors used in cancer therapy. Additionally, as more is uncovered about its influence in neurological pathways, there may be future pharmacogenetic relevance in the context of treatments for neurodegenerative diseases or psychiatric conditions. Accurate genotype-phenotype correlations could eventually pave the way for more personalized therapeutic strategies involving USP24-centric pathways.
