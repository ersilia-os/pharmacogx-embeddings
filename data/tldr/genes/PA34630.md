## Gene Summary
RORA, or retinoic acid-related orphan receptor alpha, is a member of the NR1 subfamily of nuclear hormone receptors. This gene plays significant roles in the regulation of development, metabolism, and circadian rhythm. RORA functions as a transcriptional regulator that can bind both as a monomer and as a homodimer with other nuclear receptors. The gene is widely expressed in several tissues, including the liver, adipose tissue, and thymus, which relates to its diverse roles in cellular processes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
RORA has been implicated in various diseases and physiological functions. It has been associated with autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis due to its role in immune response regulation. Additionally, its involvement in circadian rhythm makes it a gene of interest in sleep disorders and depression. Perturbations in RORA expression or function have been linked to metabolic syndrome, obesity, and glucose homeostasis, indicating its importance in metabolic regulation. The gene is also part of critical signaling pathways like steroid hormone receptor signaling and lipid metabolism pathways.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of RORA is an area of growing interest, especially with its links to circadian rhythm and metabolic disorders. Studies have suggested variations in RORA could affect the efficacy and metabolism of drugs targeting metabolic and inflammatory diseases, although specific drugs influenced directly by RORA variants are yet to be thoroughly established in clinical settings. Due to its influence on lipid metabolism pathways, there is speculative potential that RORA polymorphisms could impact the pharmacokinetics of drugs processed through these pathways, like statins, although direct evidence and specific drug-gene interactions need further research.
