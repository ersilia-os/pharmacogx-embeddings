## Gene Summary
NBEA, or neurobeachin, is a gene implicated in intracellular signaling and membrane trafficking. It encodes a protein belonging to the BEACH domain-containing protein family. NBEA is noted for its role in targeting proteins to the membranes and in neurotransmitter release, showcasing its critical functions in the nervous system. This protein has also been connected to the assembly of signaling complexes and the regulation of protein kinase A activity.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NBEA has been primarily linked to neurological and developmental disorders. Alterations or mutations in the NBEA gene have been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), emphasizing its role in neurodevelopment. The protein impacts neuronal communication which can be drastically affected in various psychiatric and developmental conditions. The signaling pathways involving NBEA generally revolve around its role in the modulation of neurotransmitter systems and synaptic plasticity, vital for learning and memory.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there are no direct pharmacogenetic associations involving NBEA with specific drugs. However, its role in neurological conditions, primarily through its impact on neuronal signaling and synaptic functionality, suggests a potential indirect influence on treatments targeting neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD. Medications that modify synaptic transmission or aim to correct synaptic anomalies could theoretically be affected by alterations in NBEA function. Further research into the pharmacogenetic implications of NBEA could potentially enhance treatment strategies for neurological conditions where synaptic dysfunction is a feature.
