## Gene Summary
AGTR1, or the angiotensin II receptor type 1, is a key gene that encodes a protein primarily involved in the cardiovascular system's regulation. It is part of the renin-angiotensin system, which helps regulate blood pressure and fluid balance. The encoded protein is a receptor for angiotensin II, a potent vasopressor hormone, and a primary regulator of aldosterone secretion. AGTR1 is highly expressed in various tissues including vascular smooth muscle, the heart, kidney, and adrenal gland. Through its action, angiotensin II induces vasoconstriction and influences water and sodium reabsorption, pivotal in controlling blood pressure and volume.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
AGTR1 is intimately involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension, heart failure, and other cardiovascular disorders. Its role is underscored by its interaction with various drugs, particularly in the management of hypertension. Pathways linked to AGTR1 involve aldosterone-regulated sodium reabsorption, which not only influences blood pressure but also impacts electrolyte balance and blood volume. Mutations or variations in this gene are associated with heightened susceptibility to several cardiovascular conditions, including myocardial infarction and renal pathologies. 

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of AGTR1 primarily concerns its responsiveness to antagonists, commonly known as angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), such as losartan, valsartan, and irbesartan. These drugs are widely used in the treatment of hypertension and are beneficial in patients with heart failure or diabetic kidney disease. Genetic variations in AGTR1 can influence the effectiveness and therapeutic outcomes of these medications. For instance, certain polymorphisms have been associated with variations in therapeutic response; patients with specific variants may show a greater reduction in blood pressure in response to ARBs. This supports the role of genetic testing in personalizing treatment plans for better management of cardiovascular diseases using AGTR1-targeted therapies.
