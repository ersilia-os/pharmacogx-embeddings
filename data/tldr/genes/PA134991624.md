## Gene Summary
NECTIN4, also known as Nectin Cell Adhesion Molecule 4, is a member of the nectin family which plays crucial roles in cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. This gene encodes for a protein that functions as a cell adhesion molecule at adherens junctions and is involved in a wide range of cellular processes including the formation of synapses in the nervous system. NECTIN4 is highly expressed in several tissues including placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. Its expression is also noted in various carcinomas, making it a potential target for cancer therapy.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NECTIN4 is implicated in several biological pathways, particularly those involving cell-cell adhesion and the establishment of polarity in epithelial cells. Dysregulation of NECTIN4 has been associated with various types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung, and pancreatic cancers. It plays a role in the progression of tumourigenesis, primarily through its interactions in the cellular adhesion pathways and possible involvement in escape from immune surveillance. Recently, NECTIN4 has gained attention as a biomarker and potential therapeutic target in oncology.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the realm of pharmacogenetics, NECTIN4 is significant due to its role as a target for cancer therapies. It is the binding site for the drug enfortumab vedotin, an antibody-drug conjugate used in the treatment of urothelial cancer. Enfortumab vedotin targets NECTIN4-expressing cells, delivering a cytotoxic agent directly to the tumor cells, thereby minimizing effects on normal cells. The expression levels of NECTIN4 can influence the efficacy and safety profile of treatments that target this protein, highlighting the importance of genetic and expression studies in personalized medicine approaches for cancer treatment.
