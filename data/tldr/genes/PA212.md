## Gene Summary
KCNH2, also known as hERG (human Ether-Ã -go-go-Related Gene), encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel that is crucial for cardiac electrical signaling. Specifically, it contributes to the current known as IKr, which helps control the repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential. This process is critical for the normal rhythm and timing of the heart. The gene is highly expressed in the heart, particularly in the myocardial cells, but has also been found in other tissues such as the brain and smooth muscle cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in KCNH2 are primarily associated with type 2 long QT syndrome (LQT2), a condition characterized by prolonged cardiac repolarization that can lead to palpitations, fainting, and sudden death due to cardiac arrest. In terms of drug interactions, certain medications can block the KCNH2 channel, leading to acquired long QT syndrome, posing significant implications for drug safety and efficacy. The gene is involved in important heart-related signaling pathways and regulatory pathways that influence cardiac action potential and overall heart function.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of KCNH2 is particularly relevant in the context of drug-induced long QT syndrome. Various drugs, including antiarrhythmics (like sotalol), antihistamines (like astemizole), antibiotics (like erythromycin), and antipsychotics (like haloperidol), have been shown to inhibit the KCNH2 channel's function. This inhibition increaseS the risk of developing long QT syndrome, which can lead to potentially fatal arrhythmias. Genetic variants of KCNH2 can alter the individual susceptibility to these drug effects, making genetic testing a potential tool for assessing risk in patients who need these medications. Knowledge of these pharmacogenetic associations is vital for clinicians to weigh the benefits and risks when prescribing these drugs to patients with or without existing KCNH2 mutations.
