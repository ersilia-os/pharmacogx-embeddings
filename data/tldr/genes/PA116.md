## Gene Summary
ABCC2, also known as ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily C Member 2, encodes the multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2). This protein is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily that plays a critical role in the transport of a variety of exogenous and endogenous substrates including bile acids, glucuronides, and other conjugates across cellular membranes. Located predominantly in the liver, kidneys, and intestine, MRP2 influences the excretion of these substances into bile and urine. Its activity is essential for detoxification processes and the protection of the organism from potentially harmful substances.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
MRP2 is associated with several key health conditions predominantly due to its role in substance transport and detoxification. Dysfunction or reduced expression of this transporter can lead to Dubin-Johnson syndrome, a rare inherited disorder characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. With respect to cancer pharmacology, MRP2 is studied for its role in contributing to chemotherapy resistance by actively effluxing anticancer drugs out of cells. In metabolic pathways, MRP2 is involved in the transport of bilirubin glucuronides and bile acids, which are critical in lipid digestion and vitamin absorption. The transporter's function influences the pharmacokinetics and toxicity profiles of many drugs by affecting their absorption and excretion.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, variations in the ABCC2 gene significantly affect the disposition and efficacy of various drugs. Polymorphisms in this gene have been associated with altered drug pharmacokinetics for antiepileptics, HIV protease inhibitors, and methotrexate among others. Specific alleles like c.1249G>A (rs2273697) and c.3972C>T (rs3740066) have been linked to differences in MRP2 function, impacting the transporter's ability to efflux methotrexate, leading to variability in toxicity and therapeutic response in cancer treatment. Additionally, genetic variants in ABCC2 may modify the response to antiviral drugs, influencing treatment outcomes in infections such as HIV. Such pharmacogenomic insights are crucial for tailoring medical treatments and optimizing therapeutic strategies based on patients' genetic profiles.
