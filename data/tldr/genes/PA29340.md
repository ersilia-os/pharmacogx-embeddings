## Gene Summary
HMMR, or Hyaluronan-Mediated Motility Receptor, encodes a protein that is centrally involved in cell motility. It was initially identified due to its role in the receptor-mediated endocytosis of hyaluronan, a major component of the extracellular matrix. HMMR is known to function in the coordination of cell migration and cell adhesion through its ability to regulate cytoskeletal components. Its expression is notably enhanced in several types of cancer cells, suggesting a vital role in tumor progression and metastasis. The gene is located on chromosome 5q34 and is widely expressed in various tissues, with higher expression levels particularly noted in cells of epithelial origin.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
HMMR is implicated in a range of diseases, predominantly cancer-related conditions such as breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers. The gene has been linked with an increased risk of developing such cancers, with studies indicating that higher HMMR expression correlates with tumor aggressiveness, poor patient prognosis, and worse survival rates. In terms of cellular pathways, HMMR is involved in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and interacts with components of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways, influencing cell survival and proliferation. Thereâ€™s also evidence pointing to its role in the mitotic spindle assembly during cell division, which has a crucial impact on cancer cell growth and stability.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic implications of HMMR are primarily linked to its role in cancer susceptibility and response to treatment. Variation in HMMR expression or function could influence the efficacy of cancer drugs, especially those targeting cell motility, proliferation, and survival pathways. For instance, drugs that interfere with hyaluronan production or its receptor functions, such as those being explored in clinical trials involving certain chemotherapy agents or targeted therapies, might have differential effects in individuals based on HMMR expression profiles. However, specific commonly used drugs directly associated with HMMR in terms of differential response based on genetic variance are not yet well-defined, indicating a need for further research in this area to develop targeted cancer therapies or prognostic tools based on HMMR status.
