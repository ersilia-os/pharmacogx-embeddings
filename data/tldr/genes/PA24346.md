## Gene Summary
PTGS1, also known as Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), is part of the cyclooxygenase family and plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of prostanoids, including prostaglandins, prostacyclin, and thromboxane. The enzyme is constitutively expressed in most tissues, maintaining physiological processes such as gastric mucosa protection, platelet aggregation, and renal blood flow regulation. PTGS1 is distinct from its inducible counterpart PTGS2 (COX-2), showing constitutive expression rather than being highly regulated by inflammatory stimuli.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
PTGS1 is a target for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, which inhibit both PTGS1 and PTGS2 to varying degrees. Inhibition of PTGS1 can lead to side effects such as gastrointestinal toxicity and impaired platelet function. Conditions associated with genetic variations in PTGS1 involve altered responses or risks including gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular events, and altered drug efficacy or toxicity. Prostanoids synthesized via PTGS1 are involved in various biological pathways and play roles in inflammation, vascular biology, and cellular homeostasis.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, polymorphisms in PTGS1 influence individual responses to NSAIDs, particularly aspirin, which is used both as an analgesic and antithrombotic agent. For instance, certain allelic variants of PTGS1 may alter the enzymeâ€™s activity or expression, thereby affecting drug efficacy and safety. Genetic variations in PTGS1 can modulate the risk of developing adverse effects like aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease or influence the protective effects against colorectal cancer or cardiovascular disease. As such, an understanding of PTGS1 genotypes could tailor NSAID therapy to improve efficacy and reduce adverse events.
