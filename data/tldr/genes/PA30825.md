## Gene Summary
MKI67, also known as the marker of proliferation Ki-67, is a crucial cellular marker for proliferation. It encodes a nuclear protein that is expressed during all active phases of the cell cycle (G1, S, G2, and mitosis), but is absent in resting cells (G0). This makes MKI67 an excellent tool for measuring the growth fraction of a given cell population, particularly useful in cancer research to assess the growth rate of tumors.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
MKI67 is predominantly associated with various cancers. High MKI67 expression is often correlated with a higher grade and more aggressive tumors, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, and gliomas. The protein serves as a prognostic marker, where its levels can predict the outcome of certain cancers. The gene is involved in pathways related to cell cycle processes and is critical in studies pertaining to cellular proliferation and cancer biology.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of MKI67 primarily revolves around its application in cancer treatment and prognosis rather than direct interactions with specific drugs. However, treatments that target proliferative signaling pathways may indirectly affect MKI67 expression levels. For instance, therapies designed to inhibit specific kinases or hormones that drive cell cycle progression in cancerous cells might modify the expression or activity of MKI67. Despite its indirect role, understanding the patterns of MKI67 expression can assist in tailoring therapy options and determining prognosis in cancer patients. Nevertheless, direct pharmacogenetic interactions involving MKI67 and specific drugs are not well-established and require further investigation.
