## Gene Summary
NFE2L2, or Nuclear Factor, Erythroid 2 Like 2, is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in cellular defense against oxidative stress by regulating the expression of antioxidant proteins. It is commonly referred to as NRF2. This factor is normally held in the cytoplasm by KEAP1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1), but upon exposure to oxidative stress or electrophilic agents, NFE2L2 is released, translocates to the nucleus, and activates the expression of genes involved in the antioxidant response. These genes include enzymes like glutathione S-transferases and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone 1.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NFE2L2 plays a critical role in the mechanism of drugs intended to manage oxidative stress and inflammation-related conditions. The pathways moderated by NFE2L2 include detoxification of reactive oxygen species and metabolic adaptation to oxidative stress. Dysregulation of NFE2L2 has been implicated in various diseases including cancer, particularly lung, breast, and skin cancers, as well as neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, underscoring its protective role against oxidative damage and the deleterious effects of electrophiles.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of NFE2L2 is significant given its central role in mediating cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative damage and electrophilic attack, processes that are pertinent to the toxicity and efficacy of numerous drugs. Variants in NFE2L2 can influence the clinical outcomes of therapies used in cancer, based on its involvement in chemoresistance and the response to chemotherapy agents. Drugs such as oltipraz and sulforaphane, which are studied for their potential to induce NFE2L2 signaling and thereby enhance antioxidant capacity, may have differential effects depending on the NFE2L2 genetic context of individuals. This genetic variance can potentially be targeted in personalized medical approaches to optimize therapeutic efficacy and minimize adverse effects.
