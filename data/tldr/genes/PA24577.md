## Gene Summary
ADH7, or Alcohol Dehydrogenase 7, encodes a member of the alcohol dehydrogenase family, which is involved in metabolizing various substances, including alcohols and retinoids. This enzyme is known for its role in metabolizing ethanol in the digestive tract and its participation in the biosynthesis of retinoic acid from retinol. ADH7 is expressed predominantly in the stomach and upper gastrointestinal tract, making it important in the first-pass metabolism of alcohol. The gene exhibits variability in expression and enzyme activity across different populations, influencing susceptibility to alcohol-related diseases and effects.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ADH7 is central to pathways like alcohol metabolism, retinol metabolism, and possibly the metabolism of other volatile and non-volatile compounds. Alterations and variations in this gene have been associated with phenotypes affecting alcohol sensitivity, dependence, and metabolism. Moreover, ADH7 gene variants are implicated in certain disease conditions, such as gastrointestinal cancers and possibly other alcohol-influenced conditions. The role of ADH7 in retinoid metabolism also suggests potential implications in diseases affected by vitamin A levels, such as night blindness and other visual impairments.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of ADH7 revolves primarily around its impact on alcohol metabolism. Variants of this gene can lead to different alcohol dehydrogenase activities, which in turn influence blood alcohol levels and the overall effects and risks of alcohol consumption. For instance, individuals with certain variants that result in decreased enzyme activity could experience heightened alcohol sensitivity and a higher risk of alcoholism or alcohol-related toxicity. Investigation into the pharmacogenetics of ADH7 can be pivotal in understanding individual responses to alcohol and guiding medical advice related to alcohol consumption and risk management in susceptible populations.
