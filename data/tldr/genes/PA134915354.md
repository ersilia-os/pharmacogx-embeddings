## Gene Summary
PNPT1 (Polyribonucleotide Nucleotidyltransferase 1), also known as PNPase, plays a crucial role in mitochondrial RNA processing and metabolism. This homotrimeric phosphorolytic exoribonuclease, located in multiple cellular compartments including the mitochondria, is involved in RNA degradation and the processing of mitochondrial mRNA precursors. PNPT1 is essential for the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis and function, thereby influencing cellular energy metabolism. Expression of PNPT1 is ubiquitous, reflecting its fundamental role across different tissues.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in PNPT1 are linked to various mitochondrial disorders, prominently featuring in conditions such as Combined Oxidative Phosphorylation Deficiency 13 (COXPD13). This disease spectrum comprises severe multisystem disorders characterized by a range of symptoms including sensorineural hearing loss, encephalopathy, myopathy, and growth retardation, reflecting the gene's critical role in mitochondrial function. PNPT1â€™s involvement in essential mitochondrial pathways underscores its impact on cellular energy metabolism and overall cellular health. Additionally, the gene's pathways include mitochondrial RNA surveillance and metabolism, which are crucial for effective mitochondrial bioenergetics and integrity.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic associations of the PNPT1 gene are not extensively studied in the context of specific drug reactions or efficacy. However, understanding the role of PNPT1 in mitochondrial function might influence the therapeutic strategies for managing mitochondrial diseases. Drugs that target mitochondrial function or biogenesis could potentially be influenced by PNPT1 activity or expression levels, thereby impacting drug effectiveness or toxicity. Future research into the pharmacogenetics of PNPT1 could shed light on more specific interactions between drugs and the gene's modulatory effects on mitochondrial health.
