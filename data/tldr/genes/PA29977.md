## Gene Summary
ITPKC, or Inositol-trisphosphate 3-kinase C, is a gene involved in the phosphatidylinositol signaling system. The enzyme encoded by ITPKC acts mainly in the regulation of T-cell activation and immune response by modulating the intracellular concentration of inositol trisphosphate (IP3), which is crucial for the control of cellular calcium levels. Its expression is primarily in immune system cells, particularly T cells, and plays a significant role in the regulation of immune signaling and calcium homeostasis.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Alterations or dysregulations in ITPKC have been linked to several immune-related conditions. One of the key diseases associated with ITPKC is Kawasaki disease, a pediatric systemic vasculitis that can lead to coronary artery aneurysms. The gene is also implicated in pathways involving calcium signaling and is potentially relevant to autoimmune disorders due to its role in immune cell function. In research models, ITPKC has been shown to affect apoptosis and proliferation of certain cell types, indicating a broader implication in cellular growth and survival processes.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the realm of pharmacogenetics, ITPKC is particularly notable for its association with the response to treatments in Kawasaki disease. Genetic variants in the ITPKC gene have been found to influence the response to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy, which is a standard treatment for Kawasaki disease. Patients with certain ITPKC polymorphisms are less responsive to IVIG, and these findings have implications for tailoring treatment strategies. This pharmacogenetic insight is crucial for predicting treatment efficacy and adjusting therapeutic approaches accordingly to improve outcomes in affected patients. Additionally, ongoing research might reveal further drugs and treatment interactions influenced by ITPKC variations, especially in the context of immune-modulating therapies.
