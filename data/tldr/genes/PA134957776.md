## Gene Summary
PSMD14, also known as proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 14, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, crucial for protein degradation and turnover. PSMD14 is a part of the 19S proteasome complex and acts primarily as a deubiquitinating enzyme, which removes ubiquitin from protein substrates before their degradation in the 20S core proteasome. This process is essential for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular processes including cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair. The gene is expressed ubiquitously across various tissues, reflecting its fundamental role in cellular function.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
PSMD14 is implicated in multiple cellular pathways including those regulating protein degradation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Although not directly linked to specific drugs, it is a considerable point of interest due to its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system that is targeted by cancer therapies like proteasome inhibitors. Altered function or expression of PSMD14 has been associated with several diseases, particularly cancers where proteasome activity is a key factor for uncontrolled cell division and survival. Inhibition of the proteasome is therapeutically exploited in treatments of hematologic malignancies and some solid tumors. The protein's role in deubiquitinating substrates before proteasomal degradation makes it a potential biomarker or therapeutic target in oncological research.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the pharmacogenetic context, PSMD14 does not yet have well-established associations with specific drugs compared to typical pharmacogenes. However, its critical role in the proteasome pathway makes it potentially relevant in the context of treatments with proteasome inhibitors, such as bortezomib, carfilzomib, and ixazomib, which are used primarily in the treatment of multiple myeloma. The efficiency and toxicity profiles of these drugs might be influenced by variations in the proteasome pathway components, including PSMD14, suggesting an area for further pharmacogenetic research. Understanding the genetic variations influencing PSMD14 function could help tailor and enhance the efficacy of proteasome inhibitors, thereby personalizing therapy for cancer patients. Thus, PSMD14 holds promise in the burgeoning field of pharmacogenetics focused on cancer therapeutics, despite the current lack of direct evidence linking it to variable drug responses.
