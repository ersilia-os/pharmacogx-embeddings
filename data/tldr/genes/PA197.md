## Gene Summary
IL4 (Interleukin 4) is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in immune response regulation. Produced primarily by T helper 2 (Th2) cells, mast cells, and eosinophils, IL4 is important for the differentiation of naive helper T cells to Th2 cells. It influences B cell development and function, principally by promoting the production of IgE in response to allergens. Additionally, IL4 has anti-inflammatory properties, as it can suppress the expression of inflammatory cytokines. The production and activity of IL4 are critical in both humoral and adaptive immunity, impacting a range of immune responses from allergies to pathogen defense.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
IL4 is centrally involved in allergic inflammation and conditions such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, and other allergic diseases. Its role in promoting Th2 cell responses also implicates it in various autoimmune diseases. The IL4 signaling pathway includes the activation of STAT6, leading to the transcription of genes involved in proliferation, survival, and differentiation of immune cells. Pharmacologically, modulating IL4 activity represents a therapeutic strategy in treating allergic and inflammatory diseases, and several drugs targeting IL4 or its receptor (IL4R) are in use or development phases, focusing primarily on asthma and atopic conditions.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of IL4 concern its influence on the efficacy and response to certain drugs, particularly those used in treating allergic and autoimmune conditions. Drugs targeting IL4 or its receptor, such as dupilumab (an IL4R inhibitor), are influenced by variations in the IL4 gene, affecting individual responses to therapy. Dupilumab is used in the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, asthma, and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, reflecting the gene's relevance in these conditions. Pharmacogenetic research continues to explore how genetic variations in IL4 might modulate response to therapy, aiming to personalize treatments in allergic and autoimmune diseases.
