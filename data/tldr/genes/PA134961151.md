## Gene Summary
NSUN3 (NOP2/Sun RNA Methyltransferase 3) encodes a mitochondrial methyltransferase that specifically methylates cytosine 34 in the anticodon loop of mitochondrial tRNA-Met. The methylation process conducted by NSUN3 is essential for the correct decoding of AUA codons into methionine during mitochondrial protein synthesis. Methylation by NSUN3 affects the stability and functionality of mitochondrial tRNAs which is crucial for mitochondrial function and overall cellular energy homeostasis. This gene's expression is ubiquitous but is particularly vital in tissues with high energy demands like the heart and skeletal muscle.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NSUN3 has been associated with mitochondrial function and its disruption has implications in various mitochondrial disorders, although specific diseases directly linked to mutations in NSUN3 are not yet well-characterized. The pathways primarily involving NSUN3 include those related to mitochondrial tRNA modification and mitochondrial protein synthesis. Any dysregulation in NSUN3 could potentially lead to broader effects on cellular metabolism and energy balance, which might contribute to metabolic disorders or mitochondrial diseases. 

## Pharmacogenetics
Current research on pharmacogenetics specifically involving NSUN3 is limited. The gene's role in mitochondrial function suggests that alterations in its activity could influence the efficacy and toxicity of drugs targeting mitochondria or cellular energy metabolism. However, detailed associations between specific drugs and NSUN3 genetic variations are yet to be extensively explored. As mitochondrial health is a critical aspect of many diseases and pharmaceutical interventions, understanding NSUN3's pharmacogenetics could in the future impact the development or use of drugs for mitochondrial dysfunction or related metabolic disorders. Further research could unveil significant pharmacogenetic interactions relevant to clinical practice.
