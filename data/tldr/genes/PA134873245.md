## Gene Summary
FARP2, or FERM, ARH/RhoGEF and pleckstrin domain protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the processes of neuronal development and morphology. FARP2, by modulating the activities of Rho family GTPases, plays a critical role in dendritic spine development and synaptic function. The protein functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which activates Cdc42, a member of the Rho family, thus influencing actin cytoskeleton reorganization and axonal guidance.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The direct association of FARP2 with specific drugs or diseases is not extensively documented compared to more prominent pharmacogenetic genes. However, disruptions in its normal function have implications in neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting its critical role in proper neural functioning. FARP2, through its modulation of the actin cytoskeleton, is indirectly associated with cellular pathways that could link to neurological diseases, particularly those affecting synaptic structures and neuronal connectivity.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic research specifically focusing on FARP2 is limited. There are no well-established direct associations between FARP2 genotypes and drug response variations observed in clinical settings as of the current knowledge. Research into FARP2 mainly covers its biological and physiological roles rather than direct pharmacological interactions. Therefore, the current pharmacogenetic implications of FARP2 are not well defined, highlighting an area of potential future research especially in understanding treatments for neurodevelopmental disorders.
