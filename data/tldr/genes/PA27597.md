## Gene Summary
ECHS1, or enoyl-CoA hydratase, short chain 1, is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the metabolism of fatty acids. It specifically functions in the second step of the beta-oxidation pathway, where it hydrates 2-trans-enoyl-CoA to L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA. This enzyme is vital for energy production, especially in tissues with high metabolic rates such as the heart and skeletal muscles. ECHS1 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, reflecting its fundamental role in cellular metabolism.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ECHS1 dysfunction is associated with several metabolic disorders, notably multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD), also known as glutaric aciduria type II. This is a severe metabolic disorder that affects the body's ability to break down fats and proteins. Defects in ECHS1 can lead to the accumulation of toxic intermediates that disrupt normal cellular processes. The phenotype includes severe developmental issues, hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and often early lethality if untreated. The ECHS1 enzyme is part of key metabolic pathways, including fatty acid metabolism, the TCA cycle, and amino acid degradation.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there is limited specific pharmacogenetic information linking ECHS1 directly to drug responses based on genetic variations. However, the critical role of ECHS1 in energy metabolism could suggest that variations in this gene might influence the efficacy and metabolism of drugs that require extensive energy for their action or those that impact metabolic homeostasis. Drugs used in the management of related metabolic disorders, such as riboflavin (Vitamin B2) which is used as a treatment in MADD, might have varied efficacy based on ECHS1 function and hence represent an indirect link to pharmacogenetics. Further research into pharmacogenetic associations of ECHS1 could lead to more personalized approaches in managing metabolic disorders linked to this gene.
