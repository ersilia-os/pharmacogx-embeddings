## Gene Summary
LIPC, also known as Hepatic Lipase, is primarily involved in the metabolism of lipoproteins. This enzyme is expressed predominantly in the liver and adrenal glands. LIPC plays a crucial role in the modulation of the plasma lipid profile by catalyzing the hydrolysis of triglycerides and phospholipids in lipoproteins, thus influencing the metabolism of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The enzyme is essential for the remodeling of HDL particles and assisting in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway, which is integral in the prevention of atherosclerosis.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
LIPC is associated with several lipid metabolism disorders, notably hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease (CAD). Variants in this gene can lead to alterations in lipid profiles, particularly affecting the levels of HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. This gene is also linked to the pharmacological responses to certain lipid-regulating drugs. The enzymatic pathways involving LIPC include lipid digestion, mobilization, and transport processes that are critical in maintaining lipid homeostasis. The gene's function connects it to energy homeostasis and has implications in the study of metabolic syndromes.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic research has identified associations between genetic variants of LIPC and differential responses to several cardiovascular drugs. Notably, variations in LIPC can influence the efficacy of statins, a class of drugs used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood. Specific LIPC gene variants have been shown to modify plasma lipid responses to statins, potentially affecting the therapeutic outcomes in treating hypercholesterolemia and reducing cardiovascular risk. Moreover, genetic polymorphisms in LIPC are also important in predicting response to fibrates, drugs that primarily decrease triglyceride levels and increase HDL cholesterol. This knowledge is crucial for the personalization of lipid-lowering therapies based on genetic profiles, aiming to optimize efficacy and minimize adverse effects.
