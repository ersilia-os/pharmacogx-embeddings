## Gene Summary
UGT2B7, or UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 2 member B7, is an enzyme encoded by the UGT2B7 gene in humans. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous compounds through glucuronidation, a process that enhances the water solubility of drugs, facilitating their excretion in urine or bile. UGT2B7 is expressed predominantly in the liver, but also found in the kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and brain, indicating its vital role in systemic detoxification and drug metabolism.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
UGT2B7 is implicated in the metabolic pathways of a variety of drugs, including important classes such as opioids, antivirals, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Issues in the function or expression of UGT2B7 can lead to altered drug efficacy and toxicity, impacting therapeutic outcomes. Additionally, variations in this gene have been associated with differences in drug response and risk of developing certain diseases, such as Gilbert's syndrome, a mild disorder affecting bilirubin metabolism often characterized by mild jaundice.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of UGT2B7 is critical due to its influence over the metabolism of clinically important drugs. For instance, it is a major enzyme involved in the metabolism of opioids like morphine and codeine into their more and less active metabolites. Variants in UGT2B7 can lead to differences in morphine clearance rates in patients, affecting analgesia and side effect profiles. In the context of NSAIDs, the enzyme converts drugs like ibuprofen into inactive metabolites, and genetic variability can modify individual's pain management outcomes. This gene's products also influence the metabolism of antiviral medications, such as zidovudine, used for HIV treatment, potentially affecting drug toxicity and the balance between efficacy and side effects in treated patients. Awareness of UGT2B7 variants is essential for personalized medicine approaches, especially in pain management and infectious disease treatment.
