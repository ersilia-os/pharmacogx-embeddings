## Gene Summary
PROM1, or Prominin 1, is a gene that encodes a pentaspan transmembrane glycoprotein, also known broadly as CD133. The protein typically localizes to membrane protrusions and is used in various cellular processes ranging from cell signaling to the dynamics of membrane flexibility. PROM1 is expressed in several types of cells, notably in embryonic epithelial structures and in adult stem cells, including hematopoietic progenitor cells and some brain and epithelial tissues. It is recognized for its role as a cellular marker in identifying cancer stem cells and its potential implication in tumor development and progression.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The PROM1 gene is related to several major diseases primarily involving retinal and macular degeneration. Notably, it is associated with Retinitis Pigmentosa and Stargardt Disease - diseases that cause progressive vision loss. Mutations in PROM1 have been characterized in cases leading to degeneration of photoreceptors, impacting visual acuity and color perception. The gene plays a pivotal role in the biology of various cancers, serving as a marker for cancer stem cells, which are critical in the understanding of cancer recurrence and metastasis. PROM1 is involved in pathways that regulate stem cell maintenance and differentiation, as well as in signaling pathways critical for maintaining the structural integrity of cellular membranes.

## Pharmacogenetics
The involvement of PROM1 in pharmacogenetics is currently not profoundly established; its primary significance in cancer research lies in its role as a cancer stem cell marker. Although not directly linked to pharmacogenetic relations with specific drugs, its expression level in tumorigenic cells may influence the responsiveness of these cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, understanding the expression dynamics of PROM1 in cancer might play a role in predicting patient response to treatments and tailoring personalized medicine approaches. Further studies are required to clarify potential pharmacogenetic associations and how these might affect drug response and patient outcomes in both oncological and non-oncological settings.
