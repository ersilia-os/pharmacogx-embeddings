## Gene Summary
NECAB1, or N-terminal EF-hand calcium-binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes a member of the neuronal calcium-binding protein family. These proteins play critical roles in the calcium signaling pathways within neurons and are implicated in a variety of cellular functions such as neurotransmitter release, gene expression, and synaptic plasticity. NECAB1 is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly within the hippocampal and cortical regions where it may have functional roles in neural transmission and neurodevelopment.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NECAB1 has not been prominently linked to specific drugs or clinical conditions in mainstream pharmacogenetics or clinical medicine. However, its role in neuronal calcium signaling suggests potential indirect associations with neurological disorders characterized by dysregulated calcium homeostasis. The gene's involvement in pathways like neuronal signaling and potentially in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease could implicate it in broader neurobiological functions and disorders.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic relevance of NECAB1 is currently minimal as there are no well-documented associations between NECAB1 genetic variations and drug response or metabolism. As a protein involved in neurobiological processes, future research could uncover relationships between specific genetic variants of NECAB1 and responses to neurological treatments or susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases, which in turn could affect therapeutic strategies. Presently, the pharmacogenetic implications of NECAB1 remain an area ripe for research rather than an established field.
