## Gene Summary
ADAMTS18 (ADAM Metallopeptidase with Thrombospondin Type 1 Motif 18) is a member of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family, known for its roles in extracellular matrix organization and cell-matrix interactions. This gene encodes an enzyme involved in the processing of procollagen and possibly other proteins such as von Willebrand factor. ADAMTS18 is expressed in various tissues, including ocular tissue, brain, and kidney. Its activity can influence cellular processes like proliferation, adhesion, and migration.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ADAMTS18 has been implicated in a variety of human diseases, particularly those involving the vascular and connective tissues. Mutations in this gene have been associated with a spectrum of disorders, including microcornea, myopia, and other ocular defects. Recent studies suggest its potential involvement in cancer biology, notably in processes like tumor suppression and metastasis inhibition. The pathways involving ADAMTS18 include those related to extracellular matrix organization and the modulation of bioactive molecules that influence tissue structure and function.

## Pharmacogenetics
While specific pharmacogenetic associations concerning ADAMTS18 are not extensively documented as of now, it is a subject of ongoing research due to its emerging relevance in oncology and ocular disorders. The enzyme's ability to modulate extracellular matrix components hints at potential therapeutic targets for diseases related to fibrosis and abnormal tissue proliferation. Future studies may reveal important interactions with drugs targeting connective tissue disorders, cancer metastasis, and ocular abnormalities, impacting therapeutic strategies and personalized medicine in those fields.
