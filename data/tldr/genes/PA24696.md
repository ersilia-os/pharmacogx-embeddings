## Gene Summary
ALDH2, or Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 2 Family Member, is a key enzyme involved in alcohol metabolism. It primarily functions in the mitochondria to oxidize toxic aldehydes to less active carboxylic acids. ALDH2 is best known for its role in metabolizing acetaldehyde, a byproduct of alcohol (ethanol) metabolism. The presence of functional ALDH2 significantly affects how different individuals respond to alcohol, as the enzyme's activity influences the rate at which acetaldehyde is cleared from the body. Variants in the ALDH2 gene, particularly the ALDH2*2 allele, lead to decreased enzyme activity and are associated with alcohol intolerance, commonly observed in East Asian populations.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ALDH2’s activity impacts susceptibility to various diseases, primarily those related to the accumulation of toxic aldehydes. Key disorders include alcohol-related conditions such as alcoholic liver disease, as well as Alzheimer's disease and certain cardiovascular diseases like myocardial infarction, where oxidative stress plays a significant role. The enzyme is involved in multiple metabolic pathways, including those for alcohol metabolism, glycolysis, and the citric acid (TCA) cycle. ALDH2 dysfunction is phenotypically manifest as flushing responses, tachycardia, and nausea upon alcohol consumption, particularly noted with the ALDH2*2 allele.

## Pharmacogenetics
ALDH2 exhibits significant pharmacogenetic relevance, especially concerning drugs used in cardiovascular and cancer therapy. Its activity influences the response to nitroglycerin, used in treating angina pectoris; reduced ALDH2 activity due to the ALDH2*2 allele results in decreased bioactivation of the drug, thereby reducing its effectiveness. Additionally, ALDH2 alterations affect the metabolism of other agents such as chloral hydrate, used as a sedative, and cyclophosphamide, used in chemotherapy, where the enzyme’s ability to metabolize aldehydes influences both efficacy and toxicity of these treatments. Personalized medicine approaches considering ALDH2 genotyping are potential strategies to optimize therapy and minimize adverse effects for these and other drugs.
