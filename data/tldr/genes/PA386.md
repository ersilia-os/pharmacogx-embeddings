## Gene Summary
SLC28A2, or solute carrier family 28 member 2, is part of the concentrative nucleoside transporter (CNT) family. Primarily expressed in the liver and kidney, SLC28A2 facilitates the active transport of nucleosides, which are key components of nucleic acids, across cell membranes. This process is essential for the salvage and recycling of nucleosides in the body. The transporter shows high affinity for purine nucleosides and pyrimidine nucleosides and also transports nucleoside-derived drugs, which are often used in antiviral and anticancer therapies.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SLC28A2 plays a critical role in the pharmacokinetics of several nucleoside analogs that are used as therapeutic agents. Dysfunction or variations in the expression of SLC28A2 are linked to alterations in drug absorption and disposition, potentially leading to variable therapeutic outcomes or toxicity. The gene is also part of significant biochemical pathways such as the purine and pyrimidine metabolism pathways which are crucial for cell viability and function. Studies suggest a potential link between the abnormal expression of SLC28A2 and certain metabolic disorders, though concrete associations with specific diseases are still under exploration.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, SLC28A2 is particularly important due to its role in mediating the cellular uptake of drugs like ribavirin, a nucleoside analog used in the treatment of Hepatitis C, and gemcitabine, used in cancer chemotherapy. Variants in SLC28A2 can significantly affect the efficacy and toxicity of these drugs, influencing patient responses to treatment. For instance, certain allelic variants are associated with an increased risk of adverse effects from ribavirin, such as hemolytic anemia. Research into the pharmacogenetic impact of SLC28A2 is ongoing, with the goal of improving personalized medicine approaches and optimizing drug dosing to enhance therapeutic efficacy and reduce toxicity.
