## Gene Summary
CCR5, which stands for C-C chemokine receptor type 5, is a protein expressed on the surface of white blood cells, including T cells and macrophages. As a member of the beta chemokine receptor family, CCR5 primarily binds to chemokines like RANTES (CCL5), MIP-1alpha (CCL3), and MIP-1beta (CCL4). This receptor plays a crucial role in the immune system by regulating leukocyte trafficking and activation. Importantly, CCR5 serves as a co-receptor for macrophage-tropic HIV-1 entry into cells, making it a significant target in HIV research. The expression of CCR5 is not only pivotal in immune function and inflammation but also implicated in various pathological conditions due to its involvement in cell signaling and migration.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CCR5 is associated with several drugs, most notably Maraviroc, an HIV entry inhibitor that selectively binds to CCR5 and prevents the virus from entering human cells. Diseases linked to CCR5 signaling include HIV/AIDS, as individuals with a specific mutation in this gene (CCR5-Delta32) are highly resistant to HIV infection. The receptor has also been implicated in several inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma. Pathologically, CCR5 plays a role in promoting or inhibiting tumor progression, depending on cancer type. This receptor is involved in multiple pathways related to inflammation, cell migration, and immune cell recruitment, highlighting its significance in both health and disease.

## Pharmacogenetics
CCR5 is integral to pharmacogenetics, especially concerning its role in HIV treatment and resistance. The naturally occurring CCR5-Delta32 mutation results in a truncated receptor, which confers resistance to HIV by preventing the virus from entering host cells. This has significant implications for therapeutic strategies, with drugs like Maraviroc designed to mimic this natural resistance by blocking the CCR5 receptor. In pharmacogenetic contexts, individuals carrying the CCR5-Delta32 allele may exhibit different responses to such treatments. Studies have indicated potential benefits of this mutation in transplant medicine and conditions involving an overactive immune system, thus impacting clinical decision-making and treatment planning based on genetic profiles involving CCR5. This genetic factor is considered during patient assessment for tailored HIV treatment regimens, demonstrating the direct impact of CCR5 pharmacogenetics on clinical outcomes.
