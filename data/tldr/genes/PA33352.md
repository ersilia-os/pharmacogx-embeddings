## Gene Summary
PKLR (Pyruvate Kinase, Liver And RBC) is a gene that encodes the enzyme pyruvate kinase, which is critical for the glycolytic pathway, catalyzing the final step of glycolysis where phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is converted into pyruvate with the concurrent production of ATP. PKLR is primarily expressed in the liver and red blood cells. The enzyme exists in different isoforms due to alternative splicing. Dysregulation or mutations in PKLR can lead to alterations in glucose metabolism and energy production in cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in PKLR are directly associated with several metabolic disorders, particularly Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency, which is an autosomal recessive disorder leading to non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia. The disease manifests due to reduced activity of the PK enzyme in red blood cells, affecting their lifespan and function. Concerning pathways, PKLR is a key component in carbohydrate metabolism, more specifically in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways. The alterations in PKLR activity might also influence broader metabolic sequences and energy management in the body, impacting physical endurance and metabolic adaptability.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic implications of PKLR primarily pertain to its influence on metabolic pathways that could affect drug pharmacokinetics and dynamics. For example, individuals with altered PKLR function might exhibit differences in how drugs are metabolized, especially those drugs that are processed through glycolytic energy-dependent mechanisms. However, direct pharmacogenetic interactions involving specific drugs have not been robustly characterized in the literature for PKLR as of the current understanding. It is hypothesized that therapies addressing metabolic dysfunctions could be tailored based on PKLR activity profiles to optimize efficacy and minimize adverse effects. Further research is needed to establish concrete pharmacogenetic guidelines linked to this gene.
