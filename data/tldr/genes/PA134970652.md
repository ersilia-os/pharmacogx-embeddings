## Gene Summary
ZNF565, also known as Zinc Finger Protein 565, is a gene located on chromosome 19 at 19p13.2. It encodes a member of the zinc finger protein family, which typically acts as transcriptional regulators in various biological processes such as development, differentiation, and metabolism. ZNF565 is specifically expressed in several human tissues, involving diverse cellular functions. Its exact molecular functions and mechanisms have been less characterized compared to other well-studied zinc finger proteins, but it potentially plays roles in DNA binding and gene expression regulation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Although ZNF565 is not directly highlighted in common pharmacogenomic pathways or strongly associated with specific phenotypes or clinical conditions, zinc finger proteins at large are implicated in various disease mechanisms, including cancer and developmental disorders. Ongoing research is likely exploring the broader roles of ZNF565, particularly how it influences gene expression patterns in health and disease. Its involvement in transcriptional regulation suggests it could play a subtler, regulatory role in numerous biological pathways and disease states.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic implications of ZNF565 are not widely documented. Current literature does not strongly link ZNF565 with specific pharmacological responses or interactions with drugs. However, the understanding of the pharmacogenetics of zinc finger proteins suggests potential areas of interest in cancer therapeutics and developmental disorder treatments, where gene expression modulation is crucial. Continued research into ZNF565 might reveal particular pharmacogenetic associations, especially concerning its role in regulating gene expression in response to certain drugs or in specific disease contexts.
