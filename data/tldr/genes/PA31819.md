## Gene Summary
NTRK3 (Neurotrophic Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 3) is a gene encoding a member of the neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (Trk) family. NTRK3 produces a protein known as TrkC, which is a receptor for neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), a factor crucial for the development and function of the nervous system. The TrkC receptor, upon binding with NT-3, promotes survival, growth, and differentiation of new neurons. It is primarily expressed in the nervous system but is also found in various non-neuronal tissues. NTRK3 signaling plays a significant role in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NTRK3 is associated with a range of clinical conditions, particularly developmental and psychiatric disorders such as congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis and obesity. It is also implicated in various cancers, including breast cancer, neuroblastoma, and colon cancer, due to mutations, overexpression, or chromosomal rearrangements like gene fusions. The canonical pathways involving NTRK3 include the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell survival and growth, and neurotrophin signaling pathways, which are central to neural growth and repair processes.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of NTRK3 centers mainly around its relevance in cancer treatment, following the identification of oncogenic fusions involving the NTRK3 gene. These fusions lead to constitutive activation and oncogenic transformation, making them a target for therapy with TRK inhibitors. Larotrectinib and entrectinib are two notable drugs that target proteins encoded by NTRK genes, including NTRK3. These drugs are designed as pan-TRK inhibitors and have shown significant efficacy in treating tumors with NTRK gene fusions. The FDA approvals of these drugs underscore the importance of molecular testing for NTRK fusions in cancer diagnostics and personalized therapy.
