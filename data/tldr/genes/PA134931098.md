## Gene Summary
PDZRN3 (PDZ Domain Containing Ring Finger 3) encodes a member of the PDZ domain-containing RING finger protein family, which is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including signal transduction, membrane trafficking, and cell polarity. PDZRN3 has been shown to interact with and ubiquitinate other proteins, thus playing a role in their degradation or functional modulation. Its expression has been noted in multiple human tissues, suggesting a generalized role in cellular metabolism and maintenance.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Research on PDZRN3 has not yet extensively linked it with specific drugs or detailed disease pathways, most likely due to its relatively broad and supportive roles in cellular functions. However, alterations in PDZRN3 expression or function could potentially impact cellular signaling pathways that contribute to pathological conditions, although these connections remain to be fully explored. Studies in animal models suggest that it may affect bone formation, based on its interaction with proteins involved in osteogenic differentiation.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of PDZRN3 has not been extensively characterized, with few direct associations noted between PDZRN3 genetic variants and differential drug response or metabolism. Due to its role in protein ubiquitination, any variations that impact PDZRN3 expression or activity could potentially alter the degradation rates of key signaling molecules, thereby influencing pharmacodynamics indirectly. Further research into PDZRN3 could help clarify any potential roles in drug efficacy or toxicity, particularly for medications targeting pathways involving protein ubiquitination and degradation.
