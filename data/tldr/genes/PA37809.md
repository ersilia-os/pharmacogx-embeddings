## Gene Summary
SOST, or sclerostin, is a protein-coding gene primarily involved in bone homeostasis. It encodes the sclerostin protein, which acts as a key negative regulator of bone growth. Sclerostin exerts its effects by inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for osteoblast activation and bone formation. This gene is predominantly expressed in osteocytes and not only contributes to the regulation of bone mineral density and strength but also plays a role in bone response to mechanical stress. Dysregulation of SOST expression is associated with changes in bone density and skeletal disorders.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SOST is linked with several skeletal conditions, most notably sclerosteosis and van Buchem disease, both of which are rare genetic disorders characterized by high bone mass and other skeletal abnormalities. In these conditions, mutations or deletions affecting the SOST gene lead to its reduced expression or function, thereby diminishing sclerostin levels and resulting in abnormal bone growth. The gene is closely involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, crucial in bone metabolism, and contributing to the pathophysiology of osteoporosis and potentially other bone-related diseases. Research also indicates its relevance in bone healing processes and osteoarthritis.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, SOST is significant due to its direct association with treatments for osteoporosis. Sclerostin inhibitors, like romosozumab, are monoclonal antibodies developed as therapeutic agents targeting the SOST gene product to modulate bone formation. This class of drugs works by inhibiting sclerostin, thereby enhancing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption. Romosozumab and similar agents have shown efficacy in the management of osteoporosis, especially in postmenopausal women, highlighting the clinical implications of SOST pharmacogenetics. The gene's variants and their expression levels could potentially influence individual responses to these therapies, suggesting a personalized approach could be beneficial in managing bone diseases associated with SOST dysfunction.
