## Gene Summary
MAT1A stands for Methionine Adenosyltransferase 1A, which is an essential enzyme predominantly expressed in the liver. It catalyzes the formation of S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) from methionine and ATP, a critical methyl donor involved in numerous methylation reactions, including DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids. MAT1A expression is crucial for maintaining liver health and function. The gene's activity also influences cellular proliferation and differentiation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Disturbances in MAT1A are associated with varied liver disorders, particularly those involving disruptions in methylation processes. Diseases linked with MAT1A dysfunction include hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis. Phenotypically, reduced activity of MAT1A may lead to hypermethioninemia, a condition characterized by elevated methionine levels in the blood. Key biochemical pathways involving MAT1A include methionine metabolism and the transmethylation pathway, both pivotal for cellular detoxification and regeneration processes.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic insights regarding MAT1A primarily relate to its impact on liver function and its response to certain drugs involved in treating liver conditions. Although direct pharmacogenetic associations between specific drugs and MAT1A variants are not well established in literature, the geneâ€™s role in hepatic health suggests potential interactions with hepatotoxic drugs or drugs requiring hepatic metabolism. Enhanced understanding of MAT1A's genetic variations could inform adjustments in dosages or drug choice in hepatic therapy to optimize safety and efficacy based on individual genetic profiles. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate these relationships and establish more precise pharmacogenetic guidelines involving MAT1A.
