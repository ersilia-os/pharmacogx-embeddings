## Gene Summary
MAP2K4 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase 4), also known as MKK4 or JNKK, is a critical enzyme in the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. It specifically phosphorylates and activates the JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinases) and p38 MAP kinases in response to various environmental stresses and pro-inflammatory cytokines. MAP2K4 is widely expressed in various tissues, with prominent levels in the skeletal muscle, pancreas, heart, and lungs. The protein plays a significant role in cellular responses to cytokines and stress, as well as in apoptosis and cellular differentiation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
MAP2K4 is involved in several critical pathways including the MAPK signaling pathway, which is pivotal in mediating cellular responses to extracellular signals. The gene is linked to the development of various diseases due to its role in these pathways, particularly inflammatory diseases and some types of cancer. Genetic variations in MAP2K4 have been associated with susceptibility to certain phenotypes like increased risk of myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular diseases.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, MAP2K4 is not extensively studied like some other genes but has potential implications in the treatment of diseases where MAPK pathways are central, such as cancer and inflammatory conditions. No specific drugs targeting MAP2K4 are widely recognized or used in clinical settings primarily aimed at this kinase. However, understanding the pharmacogenetics of MAP2K4 could be beneficial for developing targeted therapies, especially in oncology, where modulation of MAPK pathways might improve therapeutic outcomes. The investigation into how variants of MAP2K4 affect drug response and interactions could pave the way for more personalized medicine approaches in diseases involving this kinase.
