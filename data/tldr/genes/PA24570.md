## Gene Summary
ADH1A, or Alcohol Dehydrogenase 1A, is a member of the alcohol dehydrogenase family, which plays a major role in metabolizing various alcohols within the body, including ethanol. This gene encodes a protein that is located in the cytoplasm and functions as a tetramer in liver cells. It is particularly significant in the oxidation of long-chain primary alcohols and the oxidation of retinol to retinal, playing a critical role in the metabolism of vitamin A. ADH1A participates in converting ethanol to acetaldehyde, a key step in the metabolic pathway of alcohol.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ADH1A is primarily associated with the metabolic processing of ethanol and hence has a substantial impact on conditions related to alcohol consumption, such as alcoholic liver disease and potentially alcohol dependence. The activity of ADH1A also contributes to the pharmacokinetics of certain drugs that are metabolized similarly to alcohols. Pathways involving ADH1A include alcohol metabolism, retinol metabolism, and the metabolism of various other biologically significant alcohols. Given its role in alcohol metabolism, variations in this gene can influence blood alcohol levels, which are relevant in the contexts of both medical and legal intoxication assessments.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of ADH1A is particularly relevant in the context of alcohol consumption. Polymorphisms in this gene can lead to variations in enzyme activity, impacting the rate at which alcohol is metabolized. Such genetic variations can influence an individual's susceptibility to alcoholism and other alcohol-related diseases. Furthermore, individuals with certain ADH1A variants may experience different responses to drugs that are alcohols or have alcohol-like effects. These variations are significant in personalized medicine, as they can help predict therapeutic outcomes and the likelihood of adverse reactions in response to both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical compounds containing or resembling alcohol.
