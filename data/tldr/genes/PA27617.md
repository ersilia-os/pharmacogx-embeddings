## Gene Summary
EDNRA, or Endothelin Receptor Type A, is a gene that codes for a protein belonging to the endothelin receptor group of G-protein-coupled receptors. These receptors are crucial in mediating the effects of endothelin peptides, known for their potent vasoconstrictive ability. The EDNRA gene is primarily expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes. It plays a significant role in cardiac physiology and contributes to the regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
EDNRA is linked to several cardiovascular disorders due to its involvement in vasoconstriction and blood pressure regulation. Diseases such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), myocardial infarction, and potentially other cardiovascular disease states are associated with this receptor. EDNRA participates in various signaling pathways that involve calcium mobilization, which affects smooth muscle contraction and cellular proliferation. Pharmacological modulation of EDNRA has been a therapeutic target for managing diseases linked to endothelin system dysregulation.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, EDNRA has been studied for its implications in the response to drugs that target the endothelin receptor, such as endothelin receptor antagonists used in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (bosentan, ambrisentan). Polymorphisms in the EDNRA gene can influence the efficacy and safety profiles of these drugs. For example, specific variants have been associated with differences in susceptibility to side effects or variations in therapeutic efficacy among patients with PAH. Understanding the genetic variations in EDNRA can help tailor treatments that are more effective and have fewer adverse effects, illustrating the potential for personalized medicine approaches in cardiovascular care.
