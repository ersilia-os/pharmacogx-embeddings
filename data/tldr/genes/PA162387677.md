## Gene Summary
RIPOR2 (RHO Family Interacting Cell Polarization Regulator 2), also known as FAM65B, is a gene encoding a protein involved in the regulation of cell polarization, cytoskeletal organization, and migration. RIPOR2 expresses primarily in hematopoietic tissues and immune cells and interacts with Rho family GTPases, key regulators of the cytoskeleton and cellular morphology. The protein plays a significant role in the development and function of immune cells, influencing signaling pathways that control cell shape, motility, and possibly immune responses.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
RIPOR2 has been implicated in several pathways relating to cell polarization and migration, crucial in immune response and inflammation. Its involvement in diseases is still under exploration but may include immune-related disorders given its expression profile and role in immune cell functioning. RIPOR2's influence on cytoskeletal rearrangement suggests potential indirect involvement in conditions characterized by abnormal cell migration or polarization, such as cancer metastasis. As of now, specific drugs targeting RIPOR2 directly are not well-documented, and the gene is not a prominent direct target in therapeutic contexts. However, its fundamental role in cellular processes makes it an interesting candidate for further research in disease contexts involving immune cells and cancer.

## Pharmacogenetics
Current pharmacogenetic data specifically related to RIPOR2 is limited. There are no well-established pharmacogenetic associations involving RIPOR2 and the modulation of drug response or efficacy as of the last knowledge update. Given its role in immune cell behavior, future research may reveal implications of RIPOR2 variants in the effectiveness or adverse reactions to drugs that modulate the immune system or affect cell migration. As research in the field of pharmacogenetics progresses, associations may emerge that could make RIPOR2 a relevant target for specific therapeutic interventions or a predictive marker for drug responses, particularly in the areas of immunotherapy and anti-cancer drugs.
