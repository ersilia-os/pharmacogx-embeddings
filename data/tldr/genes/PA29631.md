## Gene Summary
IDH2 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 2) is a key enzyme in the citric acid cycle, primarily involved in metabolic processes. It catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate into alpha-ketoglutarate, producing NADPH in the process. IDH2 is located in the mitochondria, distinguishing it from its cytosolic counterpart, IDH1. This gene is crucial for cellular energy metabolism and also plays a role in the regulation of redox status and apoptosis. IDH2 mutations have been linked to gain-of-function metabolic activities that produce the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG).

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in IDH2 are predominantly relevant in the context of oncology, particularly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), gliomas, and cholangiocarcinoma. These mutations are associated with various metabolic and differentiation abnormalities in cancer cells. IDH2 is involved in several biological pathways including the citric acid (TCA) cycle, reductive carboxylation, and lipid metabolism. There are therapeutic agents targeting mutant IDH2, such as Enasidenib, designed specifically to target cancers harboring these specific mutations. The enzyme's function and mutation-induced dysfunction play significant roles in metabolic reprogramming, a key feature of cancer cell physiology.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of IDH2 is crucial in oncology, particularly concerning the treatment of hematologic malignancies like AML. Mutations in IDH2 can predict the response to specific inhibitors such as Enasidenib, which has been approved for the treatment of AML patients with IDH2 mutations. These drugs specifically inhibit the mutant form of IDH2, reducing the abnormal production of 2-HG which has oncogenic effects. This tailored treatment exemplifies the importance of understanding the genetic profile of IDH2 in cancer therapies, thereby enhancing personalized medicine approaches. Subtype identification and mutation-specific targeting underscore the relevance of IDH2 in precision oncology, providing critical insights that guide therapeutic decisions and prognostic assessments.
