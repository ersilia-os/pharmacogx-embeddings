## Gene Summary
The gene SMN2, or "Survival of Motor Neuron 2," is a critical gene located on human chromosome 5q13.2 that encodes the SMN, survival motor neuron protein. SMN2 is nearly identical to SMN1 but includes a critical splicing difference resulting in the majority of transcripts lacking exon 7, which produces a truncated, less stable SMN protein. SMN proteins are ubiquitously expressed and play essential roles in the assembly of the spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are vital for pre-mRNA splicing across cell types. Beyond this, SMN plays a part in axonal transport in neurons.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SMN2 is closely associated with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of spinal motor neurons leading to muscle atrophy and paralysis. SMA's severity and onset are inversely correlated with the number of SMN2 copies: greater copy numbers can partly compensate for the loss of SMN1 function. SMN2's expression, regulation, and interaction with other cellular pathways, such as those involving actin dynamics, underpin its involvement in these phenotypes, highlighting its role not only in splicing but also in neuronal architecture and function.

## Pharmacogenetics
SMN2 pharmacogenetics is primarily centered around treatments for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Drugs like Nusinersen (Spinraza) and Onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma) target the SMN2 transcript to compensate for defective SMN1 function. Nusinersen alters splicing of SMN2 pre-mRNA to include exon 7, thus producing more functional SMN protein, directly addressing the underlying genetic deficit of SMA. Onasemnogene abeparvovec involves a gene therapy approach delivering a functional copy of SMN1 to motor neurons. The response to these therapies can vary based on the number of SMN2 copies, emphasizing the gene's pharmacogenetic role in modifying treatment efficacy. Additionally, Risdiplam (Evrysdi) modulates the splicing of SMN2 transcripts to increase functional SMN protein production. These pharmacogenetic applications show how understanding and manipulating SMN2 gene function has led to significant advancements in SMA treatment.
