## Gene Summary
IPCEF1, or Interactor Protein for Cytohesin Exchange Factors 1, is a gene that encodes the protein Cytohesin binder and regulator (CYBR). This protein plays an essential role in cell signaling by interacting with cytohesin, which is involved in GTPase signaling and the activation of various downstream responses. IPCEF1 is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and motility. Expressing ubiquitously with notable presence in tissues involved in active signaling processes, IPCEF1 plays a key role in the regulation of cellular structures and trafficking.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
IPCEF1 is not directly associated with specific drugs or widely recognized genetic diseases, reflecting its broad role in basic cellular functions rather than disease-specific pathways. However, its function impacts cellular pathways such as the regulation of ARF family GTPases, critical in vesicular trafficking processes and cell morphology. Dysfunction in these processes can potentially relate to broader cellular malfunction, which could contribute to complex diseases or phenotypes involving improper cell signaling and migration, such as cancer metastasis or immune cell dysfunction.

## Pharmacogenetics
There are currently no direct pharmacogenetic associations involving IPCEF1 that impact the use of specific drugs. The gene's role in fundamental cellular processes suggests that its variability could influence individual responses to drugs that target cell signaling and migration implicitly. Research into pharmacogenetics generally focuses on genes directly linked to drug metabolism or specific targets of drug action, making studies on genes like IPCEF1 less common unless directly connected to a phenotypic drug response or treatment outcome in specific contexts.
