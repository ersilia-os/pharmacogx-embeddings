## Gene Summary
CLMN, or Calmin, encodes a protein that is involved in various cellular processes such as regulation of cell shape, adhesion, and migration. The gene is primarily expressed in tissues like brain and kidney. Calmin is believed to play a role in cytoskeletal organization given its sequence similarity to other cytoskeleton-associated proteins.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Research on CLMN has not extensively linked it with specific drugs or complex diseases directly. The primary focus has been on its role in cellular morphology and movement, suggesting potential implications in diseases that involve cellular migration such as cancer metastasis or tissue development disorders. Phenotypically, alterations in CLMN might affect cell structure and stability, impacting tissue architecture and function. It is involved in pathways regulating cytoskeletal rearrangements, crucial for processes like cell migration during development and wound healing.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is limited information on the pharmacogenetic associations of CLMN. Current research does not provide significant insights into direct interactions between CLMN and specific pharmaceutical agents. As understanding of the geneâ€™s role in cellular structures and processes deepens, potential implications for targeting in disease states like cancer or developmental disorders may emerge. However, as of now, pharmacogenetic data specific to CLMN is not well established or documented in existing databases or literature.
