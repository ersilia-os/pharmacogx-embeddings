## Gene Summary
**TANC2** (tetratricopeptide repeat, ankyrin repeat and coiled-coil containing 2) is a protein-coding gene involved in neuronal activities including synapse assembly and plasticity. The TANC2 gene product is a member of the TANC family of proteins, which also includes TANC1. This gene encodes a large protein characterized by multiple protein-protein interaction domains, such as tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), ankyrin repeats, and a coiled-coil domain. These domains suggest that TANC2 has a role in mediating intracellular interactions. TANC2 is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions essential to learning and memory.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
TANC2 has been implicated in the pathophysiology of several neuropsychological disorders, although direct associations with specific diseases are still under exploration. Its role in synaptic assembly positions TANC2 as a potential factor in disorders characterized by synaptic dysfunction, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disabilities, and other neurodevelopmental disorders. The gene's expression profile and involvement in key neuronal pathways also indicate its potential contributions to synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions. 

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of TANC2 is not extensively characterized with respect to specific drugs. However, its involvement in synaptic functions and potentially in neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders may influence responsiveness to neurological and psychiatric medications indirectly. Future studies aimed at elucidating the link between genetic variations in TANC2 and therapeutic outcomes, or adverse drug reactions, in neurological conditions are needed to fully establish its pharmacogenetic profile. Research in this area could lead to more personalized therapeutic strategies that consider the genetic makeup of individuals, particularly in the context of TANC2's impact on neuronal connectivity and function.
