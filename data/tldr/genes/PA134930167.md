## Gene Summary
DHRS4L2 (Dehydrogenase/Reductase 4 Like 2) is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) enzyme family. Its primary role involves the oxidation and reduction of steroids, prostaglandins, and other substrates by influencing their physiological properties and regulatory functions in diverse biological pathways. DHRS4L2 is closely related to DHRS4 (Dehydrogenase/Reductase 4) sharing significant sequence similarity and often studied within the context of a gene cluster that includes DHRS4 and DHRS4L2. The gene is expressed in various tissues but predominantly in the liver and kidney, where it plays a role in lipid and retinoid metabolism.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
DHRS4L2 is implicated in a range of biochemical pathways primarily involved with metabolism and detoxification of endogenous compounds. The enzyme's role in retinol metabolism suggests its involvement in pathways related to visual function and cellular growth control. There's ongoing research into how changes in the expression of this gene might be related to pathological states, especially those affecting metabolic processes such as diabetes or disorders involving impaired drug metabolism. In terms of disease linkage, variations in DHRS4L2 have not been robustly associated with specific diseases but are considered important in studies of metabolic variations among individuals that might predispose to certain conditions.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, the pharmacogenetic profile of DHRS4L2 is not as well characterized as some other genes involved in drug metabolism. However, the gene's involvement in metabolic pathways suggests that alterations in its expression or function could potentially influence the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are substrates for the enzyme it encodes. This can alter drug efficacy and safety, indicating a potential area for future pharmacogenetic research. Drugs involved in pathways influenced by retinoids and steroids might be particularly susceptible to variations in DHRS4L2 activity, although specific drugs directly associated with DHRS4L2-related pharmacogenetic effects have not yet been extensively documented. Further detailed studies could help clarify its potential impact on therapeutic outcomes and adverse drug reactions.
