## Gene Summary
RRP1B, officially known as Ribosomal RNA Processing 1 Homolog B, plays a critical role in the biogenesis and processing of ribosomal RNA, a fundamental process tied to protein synthesis in cells. RRP1B is involved in the modification and maturation of the pre-ribosomal RNA complex, crucial for the assembly of ribosomes. The gene is expressed in various tissues but shows higher expression levels in proliferating cells, reflecting its importance in supporting active protein synthesis required for cell growth and division.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
RRP1B has not been significantly linked with specific drugs or notable pharmacological interventions yet. However, mutations and alterations in RRP1B expression have been studied concerning their impact on various diseases and phenotypes. Increased expression of RRP1B has been noted in certain types of cancers, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis, likely through the enhancement of ribosomal biogenesis and cellular proliferation. Additionally, there are investigations into its pathways related to ribosomal function and assembly, emphasizing its potential indirect involvement in conditions rooted in protein synthesis dysregulation.

## Pharmacogenetics
Regarding pharmacogenetics, there is limited information connecting specific drug interactions or responses directly to RRP1B genetic variations. Research is still in the early stages, focusing more on understanding how its basal biological function impacts cell growth and disease rather than direct drug-gene interactions. However, given its role in protein synthesis, future pharmacogenetic insights could potentially arise from studies exploring drugs that target ribosomal biogenesis and function in cancer treatment. At present, no specific drugs have been linked to pharmacogenetic associations with RRP1B.
