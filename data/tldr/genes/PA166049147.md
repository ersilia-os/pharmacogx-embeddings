## Gene Summary
IFNL4, or Interferon Lambda 4, is a member of the type III interferon family, closely related to other interferons like IFN-lambda 1, 2, and 3. This gene, initially termed IL28B (for Interleukin-28B), plays a crucial role in the immune response against viral infections. IFNL4 is predominantly expressed in the liver and its expression is usually triggered by viral infections. The protein encoded by IFNL4 is involved in antiviral defense by inducing the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), thereby enhancing the innate immune response.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
IFNL4 is significant in infectious diseases, particularly those caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV). The gene's function impacts the treatment outcomes of HCV, with variations in IFNL4 influencing the natural clearance of the virus and responses to antiviral therapy. The pathways associated with IFNL4 primarily involve IFN signaling and regulation of immune responses, essential for controlling viral infections. The gene's products interact with the JAK-STAT pathway to exert their effects, which includes antiviral and immunomodulatory actions.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, IFNL4 is noteworthy for its role in the treatment of hepatitis C. Certain genetic variants of IFNL4, such as the rs12979860 polymorphism, are associated with differences in treatment response to pegylated interferon-alpha (PEG-IFN-Î±) and ribavirin, which were standard treatments for hepatitis C before the advent of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Patients with the favorable CC genotype at rs12979860 typically experience higher rates of sustained virologic response (SVR) compared to those with the CT or TT genotypes. This genetic marker has been used to guide therapeutic decisions in the era of IFN-based therapies for HCV. With the shift towards DAAs, the relevance of IFNL4 genotype has diminished in clinical practice, yet it remains a valuable example of how genetic variation can impact drug efficacy and patient management in infectious diseases.
