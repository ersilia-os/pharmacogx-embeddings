## Gene Summary
CD74, also known as HLA-DR antigens-associated invariant chain, primarily functions in the regulation of antigen presentation. The protein encoded by this gene is indispensable for the proper functioning of the immune system. It involves in the formation and trafficking of the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II) molecules. CD74 also acts as a receptor for macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and plays a role in cell signaling and the immune response. The expression of CD74 is notably observed in immune system cells, including B cells, activated T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CD74 is associated with a range of diseases predominantly related to the immune system, such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and different types of cancers including lymphoma and leukemia. The interaction between CD74 and MIF influences various inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. Moreover, the gene is part of critical immune response pathways including the antigen processing and presentation pathway, which is crucial for immune surveillance and response. The role of CD74 in cancer and autoimmune diseases makes it a target for therapeutic interventions, including monoclonal antibodies.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, CD74 is particularly important owing to its role in the efficacy and response to immunotherapies. One notable drug targeting CD74 is milatuzumab, a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The response to such treatments can vary significantly among individuals, partially influenced by genetic variations in the CD74 gene. Understanding the pharmacogenetics behind CD74 can help refine therapeutic strategies, optimising treatment efficacy and minimizing adverse effects for immune-related disorders and certain cancers.
