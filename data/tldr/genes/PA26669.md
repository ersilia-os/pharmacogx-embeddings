## Gene Summary
CNNM2, or Cyclin M2, is a gene that encodes a member of the ancient conserved domain-containing protein family which is involved in magnesium transport and homeostasis. CNNM2 is expressed in various tissues but is particularly prominent in the kidney and brain. The protein has a fundamental role in maintaining magnesium balance within cells and is crucial for many cellular processes including DNA synthesis, protein production, and the maintenance of the nervous system.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations and dysregulation of CNNM2 have been linked to several neurological disorders. Notably, CNNM2 is associated with hypomagnesemia, a condition characterized by abnormally low levels of magnesium in the blood, which can lead to neuromuscular and cardiac manifestations. The importance of CNNM2 in neural development and function suggests its potential role in neurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy. The gene is involved in pathways regulating ion transport and cellular magnesium homeostasis, which are critical for maintaining normal physiological conditions.

## Pharmacogenetics
While CNNM2 has been implicated in various diseases, specific pharmacogenetic data linking CNNM2 mutations with drug responses or adverse drug reactions are limited. Research into CNNM2's role in disease has mostly focused on its physiological function rather than its interaction with drugs. Future studies might explore how variations in CNNM2 influence the efficacy and safety of drugs used to manage magnesium-related disorders or neurological conditions. This could lead to more personalized approaches in treating conditions associated with CNNM2 dysfunctions, potentially involving magnesium supplements or other agents affecting magnesium metabolism.
