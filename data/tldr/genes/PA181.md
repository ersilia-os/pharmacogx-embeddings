## Gene Summary
NR3C1, short for Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 3 Group C Member 1, encodes the glucocorticoid receptor, which is crucial in the regulation of metabolism, immune response, and stress responses. This receptor binds glucocorticoids, a class of steroid hormones, which allows it to move to the nucleus of a cell where it can influence the expression of glucocorticoid responsive genes. The glucocorticoid receptor is expressed in a wide variety of tissues, notably in those involved in immune response such as leukocytes. The receptor plays roles in development, metabolism, mood, and immune function.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Glucocorticoids like prednisone and dexamethasone are therapeutic agents that act through NR3C1. The gene is implicated in several disease states primarily through dysregulation of the stress response and immune system. Conditions such as asthma, autoimmune diseases, leukemias, and other inflammatory diseases are associated with NR3C1 malfunction or altered expression. Genetic variability in this receptor contributes to differences in phenotypes regarding corticosteroid response in asthma and autoimmune diseases. Major pathways including the glucocorticoid receptor signaling pathway and the inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathway are affected by the action of NR3C1.

## Pharmacogenetics
Variants in NR3C1 can influence the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of glucocorticoids, impacting drug efficacy and the risk of side effects. Certain polymorphisms have been linked to variations in sensitivity to glucocorticoids, affecting conditions such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. For instance, specific NR3C1 variants are associated with altered responses to drugs like prednisolone and dexamethasone, which can guide dosage and treatment decisions. Pharmacogenetic testing can inform personalized therapy strategies, potentially increasing the efficacy and reducing the adverse effects of glucocorticoid treatments.
