## Gene Summary
XRCC1 (X-ray Repair Cross Complementing 1) plays a crucial role in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks, which are common types of DNA damage. The XRCC1 protein acts as a scaffold that organizes other proteins at the site of damage and helps facilitate the efficient repair of DNA. It interacts with multiple DNA repair proteins such as DNA ligase III, DNA polymerase beta, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). XRCC1 is also involved in base excision repair (BER) and single-strand break repair (SSBR) pathways. Levels of XRCC1 are ubiquitously expressed across different tissues in the body, reflecting its fundamental role in maintaining genomic stability.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The XRCC1 gene is associated with the cellular response to a variety of external and internal factors leading to DNA damage, such as exposure to radiation or toxic chemicals, which implicates it indirectly in cancer risk and progression. Variants in XRCC1 can influence individual susceptibilities to various cancers, including lung, breast, and colorectal cancers. XRCC1 is crucial for cell survival following DNA damage and hence is involved in pathways such as DNA damage response, regulation of apoptosis, and cell cycle checkpoints. Given its critical function in DNA repair, XRCC1 also impacts the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents that rely on inducing DNA damage to kill cancer cells.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, XRCC1 has demonstrated relevance, particularly in modulating responses to chemotherapy due to its role in DNA repair. Polymorphisms within the XRCC1 gene have been associated with differential responses to platinum-based drugs (like cisplatin and carboplatin), which are used predominantly in the treatment of various solid tumors such as ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers. Individuals with certain XRCC1 genotypes may experience altered efficacy of these drugs, potentially influencing clinical outcomes such as survival rates or rate of adverse events. Moreover, the presence of specific XRCC1 variants has been correlated with an increased risk of developing therapy-related toxicities, underscoring the importance of XRCC1 in personalized cancer therapy.
