## Gene Summary
GSTT1, or Glutathione S-transferase theta-1, is part of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family which plays a critical role in detoxifying exogenous and endogenous compounds. This enzyme catalyzes the conjugation of reduced glutathione to a wide range of substrates, facilitating their solubility and excretion. GSTT1 is expressed in various tissues, including the liver and kidneys, which are key sites for detoxification processes. The gene is notably polymorphic, with a common deletion variant known as the "null" genotype, leading to a complete lack of enzyme expression.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Research has linked the GSTT1 gene to a range of diseases, primarily those influenced by environmental exposures to toxins and carcinogens, such as bladder and lung cancers. The gene's function is crucial in the metabolism and detoxification pathway, primarily concerning the detoxification of products resulting from oxidative stress. GSTT1 is also involved in cellular defense mechanisms against toxic chemicals and oxidative stress, contributing to its linkage with various disease processes affected by environmental factors.

## Pharmacogenetics
GSTT1's pharmacogenetics primarily concern its null polymorphism, which affects an individual's capacity to metabolize and detoxify certain drugs and carcinogens. The absence (null genotype) of GSTT1 enzyme activity can lead to differences in drug efficacy and toxicity, influencing treatment outcomes in chemotherapy. For instance, individuals without active GSTT1 may have increased susceptibility to toxicity from drugs that rely on glutathione conjugation for their clearance. Additionally, this genetic variation has implications for susceptibility to adverse effects from environmental toxins and carcinogens, as well as the efficacy of chemopreventive agents. Drugs such as busulfan and chlorambucil, used in chemotherapy, are notably influenced by GSTT1 activity. Understanding an individual's GSTT1 status can be crucial in optimizing dosages and reducing adverse effects in therapeutic regimens.
