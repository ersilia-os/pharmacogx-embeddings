## Gene Summary
SLC22A9, an acronym for "Solute Carrier Family 22 Member 9," belongs to the organic anion transporter (OAT) family. This gene encodes a protein involved in the transport of various endogenous and exogenous organic anions, particularly bile acids, in the liver. SLC22A9 is expressed predominantly in the liver but is also found in other tissues such as the kidney. The protein plays a key role in the hepatic uptake and excretion processes that are critical for maintaining bile acid homeostasis and overall metabolic regulation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SLC22A9 is implicated in the transport of drugs and their metabolites, influencing drug efficacy and toxicity. Its role in bile acid transport suggests a possible involvement in liver-related disorders, such as cholestasis or other diseases affecting bile acid synthesis and secretion. The pathways linked to SLC22A9 primarily include those related to drug metabolism and the enterohepatic recycling of bile acids. Abnormal function or expression of this transporter can lead to alterations in drug pharmacokinetics and dynamics, potentially resulting in adverse drug reactions or altered therapeutic efficacy.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the field of pharmacogenetics, SLC22A9 is studied primarily for its influence on the pharmacokinetics of drugs, including several commonly used medications that are processed through bile acid-related pathways. Variants within the SLC22A9 gene may affect the function and expression of the encoded transporter, thus altering the hepatic uptake and systemic circulation of these substances. However, specific drugs that have been robustly linked with SLC22A9 in pharmacogenetic contexts have not been distinctly outlined in current literature, underlining the need for further research to establish clear associations and potential clinical implications for drug dosing and safety.
