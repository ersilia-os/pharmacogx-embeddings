## Gene Summary
MMP10, or matrix metallopeptidase 10, is part of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) family, which are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in normal physiological processes such as embryonic development, reproduction, and tissue remodeling, as well as in disease processes, such as arthritis and metastasis. MMP10 is known for its ability to degrade components like collagens and elastin, which are critical for the structural integrity and repair of tissues. This gene is expressed in various tissues but is particularly noted in areas undergoing remodeling or repair.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
MMP10 is implicated in several pathways involving tissue remodeling and repair. Diseases associated with MMP10 include conditions related to abnormal tissue degradation and remodeling, such as cancer (particularly in tumor invasion and metastasis), heart diseases, and inflammatory diseases. MMP10's activity influences these pathological states by modulating the extracellular matrix. The gene plays a critical role in various phenotypes primarily related to the structural integrity and dynamics of tissues.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of MMP10 is largely focused on its role in disease progression and response to therapy in conditions such as cancer. Although specific drugs targeting MMP10 are limited, understanding the gene's influence on therapy regimens that involve tissue remodeling could be significant. For example, drugs aiming to inhibit MMPs could potentially be modulated based on MMP10 activity or expression to enhance therapeutic efficacy particularly in oncology or cardiovascular therapies where excessive matrix degradation is detrimental.
