## Gene Summary
ADHFE1, officially known as alcohol dehydrogenase iron-containing 1, is primarily involved in the metabolism of various substances within the body through its oxidation-reduction process. The enzyme encoded by ADHFE1 belongs to the hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase family and is known to play a role in the metabolism of alcohols into aldehydes and ketones. The expression of ADHFE1 is notably high in the liver but is also found in other tissues such as the heart and kidney. Additionally, ADHFE1 has been linked to the metabolism of retinol, further emphasizing its role in physiological processes involving vitamin A.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ADHFE1 is not prominently known for its direct association with specific drugs or diseases. However, its general role in alcohol metabolism suggests a potential influence on conditions related to alcohol consumption, such as alcoholic liver disease or ethanol toxicity. The gene's involvement in retinol metabolism also ties it to biological processes that are crucial for vision, cellular growth, and overall developmental biology. Despite the lack of direct clinical associations, disruptions in ADHFE1 expression or function could influence phenotypes related to these broader metabolic pathways and potentially contribute to related pathophysiological states.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is limited specific pharmacogenetic data directly associated with ADHFE1. Due to its role in alcohol and aldehyde metabolism, genetic variability in ADHFE1 could potentially modulate the effects of drugs that are metabolized similarly or produce aldehyde intermediates. Furthermore, understanding individual differences in the ADHFE1 gene expression or enzyme activity could help predict responses to drugs affecting cellular redox states or involving retinal metabolism. However, detailed associations with particular pharmacologic agents have yet to be robustly characterized within the existing literature or clinical pharmacogenetics databases. This gene remains a candidate for further investigation in the context of personalized medicine and drug metabolism.
