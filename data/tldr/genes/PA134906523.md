## Gene Summary
CES1P1, also known as carboxylesterase 1 pseudogene 1, is a pseudogene related to the CES1 gene. Pseudogenes are segments of DNA that are similar to normal genes but generally lack the ability to encode functional proteins. CES1 is primarily involved in the hydrolysis of ester- and amide-bond-containing drugs such as cocaine and heroin, suggesting the parent gene's role in drug metabolism. However, CES1P1 itself does not directly express any functional enzyme but may play regulatory roles or participate in gene expression modulation through various genetic or epigenetic mechanisms.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Given that CES1P1 is a pseudogene, its direct involvement in metabolic pathways, diseases, or phenotypic effects is not established like its functional counterparts. Pseudogenes can sometimes influence the expression of other genes and may be involved in gene silencing or modification activities. Studies are still required to ascertain whether CES1P1 has any direct or indirect effect on specific drugs, diseases, or pathways through regulatory functions or as a part of broader genomic networks.

## Pharmacogenetics
In terms of pharmacogenetics, CES1P1 does not have direct associations with drugs due to its status as a pseudogene. However, its homology with the active CES1 gene suggests potential indirect implications in genetic studies or genomic interpretations related to drug metabolism mediated by CES1. Therefore, any variations or mutations in the regulatory regions of CES1P1 might have an impact on the expression or function of CES1, indirectly influencing the pharmacokinetics of CES1 substrates like methylphenidate, oseltamivir, and clopidogrel. These potential interactions are speculative, pending further genomic research and clinical validation.
