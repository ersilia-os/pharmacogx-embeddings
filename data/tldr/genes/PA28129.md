## Gene Summary
FGFR3, or Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3, is involved in important cellular processes including growth, differentiation, and repair. FGFR3 is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family and binds fibroblast growth factors to mediate signal transduction. FGFR3 signaling is crucial during skeletal development and has a role in regulating bone growth and maintaining bone and cartilage homeostasis. Its expression is observed in various tissues, prominently within cartilage.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in FGFR3 are primarily associated with skeletal disorders such as achondroplasia, which is the most common form of dwarfism, characterized by short limb lengths and specific facial features. Other disorders linked to FGFR3 mutations include thanatophoric dysplasia and hypochondroplasia, both of which are severe forms of short-limbed dwarfism. The gene plays roles in pathways involving MAPK signaling and PI3K-Akt signaling, which are integral to cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Recently, aberrant FGFR3 signaling has been implicated in various cancers, including bladder and cervical cancers.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the realm of pharmacogenetics, FGFR3 has garnered attention for its implications in cancer therapy. Drugs targeting FGFR3, such as infigratinib, erdafitinib, and pemigatinib, are used in treating cancers where FGFR3 mutations or overexpression is a driving factor. For example, infigratinib is designed for the treatment of patients with FGFR3-mutant urothelial carcinoma, providing a targeted therapy option that capitalizes on the specific genetic composition of the tumor. Genetic testing for FGFR3 mutations can help in the personalized treatment planning for patients, optimizing therapeutic outcomes by employing FGFR inhibitors in cases where they are most likely to be effective based on the individual's genetic profile.
