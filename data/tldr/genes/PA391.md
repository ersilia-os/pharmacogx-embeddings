## Gene Summary
NR1I3, also known as the nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group I, member 3, is widely recognized by its common name, the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). This gene encodes a transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of genes involved in drug metabolism and transport. NR1I3 is predominantly expressed in the liver but can also be found in other tissues such as the intestine. It is activated by various xenobiotics, including many drugs and environmental contaminants, initiating transcription of genes responsible for xenobiotic metabolism.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NR1I3 interacts with a variety of drugs primarily by regulating the expression of enzymes and transporters that mediate their metabolism, such as those encoded by the CYP (cytochrome P450) gene family. It is closely associated with the pharmacokinetics of drugs influenced by CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 among others. Dysregulation of NR1I3 activity can contribute to altered drug metabolism, resulting in variations in drug efficacy and toxicity. Additionally, NR1I3 is linked to several metabolic pathways including steroid hormone biosynthesis and lipid metabolism. Its dysfunction has implications in diseases like diabetes, obesity, and hepatitis, even though direct clinical associations are not fully defined.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, NR1I3 is significant primarily for its role in influencing the detoxification and clearance of numerous medications. For example, it modulates the metabolism of drugs like phenobarbital, rifampicin, and omeprazole through its action on CYP450 enzymes. Specifically, NR1I3 activation by phenobarbital and rifampicin leads to increased transcription of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4, enhancing drug metabolism which can require dosage adjustments to maintain therapeutic efficacy. Genetic variants of NR1I3 can affect its expression or function, leading to interindividual differences in the metabolism of these drugs. This makes NR1I3 a target of interest for personalized medicine approaches, aiming to tailor drug therapies based on individual genetic profiles to optimize efficacy and minimize adverse effects.
