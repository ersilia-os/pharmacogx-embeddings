## Gene Summary
TTC37, also known as the "tetratricopeptide repeat domain 37," is a gene primarily involved in the process of protein-protein interactions. It encodes a protein that is a component of the Ski complex, which has a role in the regulation of translation and may also be involved in RNA processing. The gene is known for its expression in various human tissues and plays a crucial role in cellular machinery, particularly in the context of multi-protein complexes that facilitate fundamental cellular processes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
TTC37 is notably implicated in a rare autosomal recessive disorder known as trichohepatoenteric syndrome (THES), or syndromic diarrhea. This syndrome is characterized by intractable diarrhea in infancy, facial dysmorphism, hair abnormalities, and liver and skin disease. The pathogenic mutations affecting TTC37 disrupt the normal function of the Ski complex, leading to these clinical manifestations. The gene is involved in translational pathways and potentially in RNA quality control mechanisms, emphasizing its broad role in genetic regulation and cellular health.

## Pharmacogenetics
Presently, research into the pharmacogenetics of TTC37 is limited, reflecting its primary connection to a congenital, genetic disease rather than pharmacological treatments. No specific drugs are directly associated with the modulation of TTC37, as the management of trichohepatoenteric syndrome focuses on symptomatic treatments and support rather than targeted pharmaceutical therapy based on TTC37 mutation status. Further research might be needed to explore any pharmacogenetic roles of TTC37 or the development of therapeutic agents that could modulate the function of the Ski complex for clinical benefit.
