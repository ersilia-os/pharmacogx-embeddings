## Gene Summary
ME3, officially named malic enzyme 3, is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate, generating NADPH in the process. Predominantly expressed in the kidneys and other tissues, ME3 plays a critical role in cellular energy metabolism and lipid biosynthesis. The encoded protein is part of the NAD-dependent malic enzyme family, crucial for managing the cellular redox state and for the anaplerotic flux of carbon into the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ME3 is implicated in metabolic pathways that influence several biochemical processes within cells, particularly in relation to energy production. Though not directly linked to specific diseases, its role in metabolic pathways makes it a peripheral actor in metabolic disorders or syndromes where energy production and lipid metabolism are disrupted. The enzymeâ€™s function in generating NADPH is essential for fatty acid synthesis, hinting at its indirect involvement in lipid-related disorders. Biochemically, ME3's activity is integral to the conversion processes within the Krebs cycle, crucial for cellular respiration and energy expenditure.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there is limited information on specific pharmacogenetic associations involving ME3. Due to its involvement in cellular metabolism and redox reactions, future research may uncover associations with drugs targeting metabolic pathways, particularly those involved in diabetes or obesity where lipid and energy metabolism are primary concerns. Nonetheless, as of the current knowledge base, ME3 does not have direct links to specific pharmacogenetic interactions that influence drug response effectively warranting further exploratory studies in the context of personalized medicine.
