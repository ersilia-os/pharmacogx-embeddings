## Gene Summary
HMBS (Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase) is an essential enzyme in the heme biosynthesis pathway. It catalyzes the conversion of hydroxymethylbilane (HMB) into uroporphyrinogen III, which is a critical precursor for the production of heme. Heme is a vital component of hemoglobin, myoglobin, and various cytochromes that are crucial for oxygen transport and energy production in cells. HMBS is widely expressed in various tissues but is particularly prominent in the liver and erythroid cells (red blood cell precursors).

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
HMBS is closely linked to a genetic disorder known as Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP), a condition characterized by deficiencies or mutations in the HMBS gene leading to the accumulation of toxic porphyrin precursors. Patients typically present with neurovisceral symptoms such as abdominal pain, neuropathies, and psychological disturbances. The enzyme's role in heme synthesis places it at a pivotal point in metabolic pathways that also interact with drug metabolism and the oxidative stress response.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of HMBS is primarily significant in the context of Acute Intermittent Porphyria. Drugs that induce cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver can exacerbate the symptoms of AIP by increasing the demand for heme and thus depleting HMBS activity. Safe use of drugs in AIP patients requires careful consideration, with some drugs being contraindicated. These include barbiturates, sulfonamide antibiotics, and some anticonvulsants which can trigger AIP attacks through their enzyme-inducing properties. Conversely, hemin and glucose are used therapeutically to suppress heme synthesis and alleviate symptoms. Genetic testing for HMBS mutations is crucial for the diagnosis and management of AIP, guiding the selection and dosing of drugs to mitigate risks of adverse reactions due to enzyme deficiency.
