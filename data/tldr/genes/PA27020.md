## Gene Summary
CTPS1, or Cytidine triphosphate synthase 1, is involved in the biosynthesis of cytidine triphosphate (CTP) which plays a crucial role in RNA and DNA synthesis. The enzyme catalyzed by CTPS1 is essential for de novo CTP synthesis pathway. It is expressed in various tissues, with significant relevance in rapidly dividing cells, including those in the immune system and malignancies. CTPS1's activity is critical for cellular proliferation and DNA synthesis, making it a pivotal enzyme in metabolic and replication processes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CTPS1 has implications in several disorders primarily due to its role in nucleotide synthesis. It has been associated with immunodeficiency conditions, where defects in CTPS1 can lead to reduced immune cell function and abnormal development. Pathways involving CTPS1 include purine and pyrimidine metabolism, with particular emphasis on the salvage and de novo synthesis pathways of pyrimidines. Because of its fundamental role in nucleotide synthesis, CTPS1 is also considered in studies related to cancer, where proliferative signaling is abnormally activated.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of CTPS1 is particularly relevant in the context of immunosuppressive and anticancer therapy. Drugs targeting nucleotide synthesis, like ribavirin, a nucleoside inhibitor used in the treatment of Hepatitis C and certain viral hemorrhagic fevers, have been studied in relation to CTPS1 activity. The efficacy and toxicity of such drugs can be influenced by variations in the CTPS1 gene, impacting drug metabolism and therapeutic outcomes. Understanding CTPS1 pharmacogenetics helps in tailor-making treatments and dosing for affected individuals to optimize efficacy and minimize adverse effects, although specific common variants with broad clinical implications are yet to be fully established.
