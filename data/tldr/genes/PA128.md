## Gene Summary
CYP2D6, or Cytochrome P450 Family 2 Subfamily D Member 6, is a gene that encodes an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many drugs and environmental chemicals. This enzyme, found primarily in the liver, plays a critical role in the metabolism of about 25% of clinically used drugs, through processes such as dealkylation and hydroxylation. CYP2D6 is highly polymorphic, with more than 100 known alleles, leading to significant variability in enzyme activity among individuals. This polymorphism can affect a person's response to medications, with consequences ranging from no therapeutic effect to adverse drug reactions.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CYP2D6 is involved in the metabolic pathways of a wide array of drugs, including antidepressants, antipsychotics, beta-blockers, opioids, and tamoxifen. The enzyme is particularly important in the pharmacokinetics of drugs such as codeine, where it metabolizes codeine into its active form, morphine. Variants of CYP2D6 can lead to different metabolizer phenotypes, including poor, intermediate, extensive, and ultrarapid metabolizers. Diseases linked to variations in this gene include altered drug metabolism and adverse drug reactions such as toxicity. In terms of pathways, CYP2D6 is a part of the cytochrome P450 system, which is crucial for the phase I metabolism of many substances.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic testing for CYP2D6 is highly relevant in personalized medicine to tailor pharmacological therapies based on individual genetic makeup. For example, ultrarapid metabolizers may experience reduced efficacy of drugs like codeine due to faster conversion to morphine, which is quickly cleared from the body, while poor metabolizers might show increased sensitivity or adverse effects to the same drug. Other drugs heavily influenced by CYP2D6 activity include antidepressants such as paroxetine and fluoxetine, antipsychotics like risperidone, and the antiestrogen tamoxifen, which requires activation by CYP2D6 to exert its therapeutic effect in breast cancer treatment. Consequently, variations in CYP2D6 can significantly impact the pharmacological and adverse effects of these medications, leading to the need for dose adjustments or even alternative therapies based on CYP2D6 genotype.
