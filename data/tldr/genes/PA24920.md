## Gene Summary
AQP2, or Aquaporin 2, is a water channel protein primarily expressed in the kidneys, specifically in the principal cells of the collecting duct system. This channel is essential for water reabsorption, a key process in urine concentration and body water homeostasis. AQP2 facilitates the transport of water across cell membranes in response to hormonal control, particularly by vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone, ADH). Its regulation involves both short-term (translocation of channels to and from the membrane) and long-term (changes in channel abundance) mechanisms, regulated by phosphorylation states influenced by vasopressin.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
AQP2 dysfunction or altered expression relates to several water balance disorders, notably diabetes insipidus, primarily nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) where the kidney is resistant to the action of vasopressin. Mutations or dysregulation in the AQP2 gene or its pathway components can lead to inappropriate water reabsorption, manifesting clinically as polyuria (increased urine production) and polydipsia (increased thirst). Research has also suggested links between AQP2 expression and conditions like congestive heart failure and liver cirrhosis, where body water regulation is often compromised. Pathway associations center around the vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption pathway.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, the focus surrounding AQP2 predominantly relates to its role in the response to treatments in diseases like nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Drugs influencing AQP2 activity include vasopressin analogs and diuretics. For instance, desmopressin (synthetic vasopressin) is used to manage central diabetes insipidus; however, its effectiveness may vary depending on AQP2 gene mutations or expression levels in NDI. In cases of NDI, treatment may involve the use of thiazide diuretics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which indirectly affect AQP2 activity by altering renal handling of water and sodium. Understanding the genetic background of AQP2 may enhance the personalization of therapies for disorders involving water imbalance, facilitating better clinical outcomes.
