## Gene Summary
IFNL3, formerly known as IL28B, stands for Interferon Lambda 3. It is part of the type III interferon family, which plays a crucial role in the immune response to viral infections. IFNL3 is primarily involved in antiviral defense and modulates immune system activity. The gene encodes a cytokine that is structurally related to the interleukins and interferon family proteins and signal through the Jak-STAT pathway. It is expressed in a variety of tissues, but most notably in the liver, which is significant in the context of its role in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
IFNL3 has been closely associated with the response to viral infections, particularly HCV. Variations in this gene have been significantly linked to differences in the treatment response and natural clearance of HCV. Additionally, IFNL3's protein product is involved in the modulation of immune responses, which can impact a wide range of autoimmune diseases and potentially influence susceptibility to other infectious diseases. IFNL3 interactions predominantly involve pathways related to viral mRNA translation and immune system signaling.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of IFNL3 is particularly notable in the context of HCV. Genetic variants of IFNL3, such as rs12979860, have been shown to predict the response to antiviral therapy in HCV-infected patients. Those with the CC genotype at this SNP are more likely to achieve a sustained virologic response when treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, compared to carriers of the CT or TT genotypes. This information has been used to guide treatment decisions, optimizing therapy by tailoring treatment duration and intensity based on IFNL3 genotype. Furthermore, these insights have added a layer of personalization in the treatment regime that significantly improves outcomes for patients with HCV.
