## Gene Summary
VKORC1, or Vitamin K Epoxide Reductase Complex Subunit 1, is critical for the vitamin K cycle, which is vital for activating the vitamin K-dependent proteins involved in blood coagulation and bone metabolism. VKORC1 reduces vitamin K epoxide to its hydroquinone form, a crucial step in the activation of clotting factors such as II, VII, IX, and X, as well as other proteins. The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, heart, and pancreas.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
VKORC1 is directly associated with the pharmacological pathways involving coumarin-type anticoagulant drugs like warfarin. Mutations in this gene can cause deficiencies in the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, leading to bleeding conditions such as warfarin sensitivity and vitamin K-dependent clotting factors combined deficiency (VKCFD), Phenotypes include variations in anticoagulation response and differing doses requirement for warfarin due to altered enzyme activity.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of VKORC1 is particularly notable in the context of warfarin dosing. Warfarin is a widely used oral anticoagulant with a narrow therapeutic index, requiring careful dose adjustments to avoid adverse effects. Allelic variations in VKORC1 can alter enzyme activity, influencing warfarin sensitivity and dosage requirements. For instance, the VKORC1 -1639 G>A polymorphism substantially affects the dose of warfarin necessary to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation. Patients with the AA genotype usually require lower warfarin doses compared to those with the GG genotype. This has led to dosing algorithms that include VKORC1 genotype to optimize warfarin dosing and improve patient safety.
