## Gene Summary
CDK1 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 1) is a highly essential protein kinase in eukaryotes and plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the cell cycle. CDK1, often associated with various cyclins, is primarily responsible for the transition between different phases of the cell cycle, especially the G2/M transition. This kinase is involved in the initiation of mitotic events through phosphorylation of a range of substrates, thereby controlling cell cycle progression at different checkpoints. The activity of CDK1 is tightly regulated by cyclins, as well as by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CDK1 is implicated in multiple pathways including cell cycle control, DNA replication, and damage response processes. Its dysfunction or deregulation is often linked to cancerous growth due to uncontrolled cell division, making it a significant target in cancer therapy. The role of CDK1 in tumorigenesis has made it a focus of research for novel anti-cancer drugs aimed at halting cell cycle progression. In addition, mutations or altered expression of CDK1 has been noted in various types of cancers, such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer, highlighting its relevance in disease pathology.

## Pharmacogenetics
While CDK1 itself is not directly targeted by many conventional drugs, its critical function in cell cycle regulation makes it a potential indirect target for chemotherapeutic agents. Research into CDK1 has led to the development of CDK inhibitors, which are a new class of anti-cancer drugs targeting various CDKs including CDK1, aiming to disrupt cancer cell proliferation and survival. Some of these inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. The pharmacogenetics of CDK1 involves studying its gene variations and their effects on drug response rates and outcomes in cancer therapy, which could provide valuable insights for personalized medicine approaches in oncology.
