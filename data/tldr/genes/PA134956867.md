## Gene Summary
LRRC15, standing for Leucine Rich Repeat Containing 15, is a gene that encodes a protein predominantly expressed in various connective tissues, including muscle, bone, and stromal cells. The LRRC15 protein is characterized by a series of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting a role in cell adhesion and signal transduction. The expression of LRRC15 is often associated with the development and progression of certain fibrotic conditions and cancers, functioning potentially as a marker for stromal activation in malignant tissues.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
LRRC15 is linked with the pathogenesis of several types of cancer, including breast, head and neck, and particularly those known for high levels of stromal fibrosis. Its expression is associated with poor prognosis in several carcinomas. The gene is involved in pathways related to extracellular matrix organization and cell adhesion, crucial for cancer cell migration and metastasis. Because of its role in stromal regions of tumors, LRRC15 might influence tumor microenvironment, impacting cancer progression and response to therapy.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, LRRC15 has emerging significance, particularly in the context of cancer therapy. Recent studies pinpoint its role in resistance to certain chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting that LRRC15 might modulate the effectiveness of drugs targeting the extracellular matrix or involved in stromal interactions. However, detailed pharmacogenetic associations concerning specific drugs remain under investigation, and further research is necessary to elucidate precise drug-gene interactions and develop potential targeted therapies involving LRRC15 modulation, especially in fibrotic and tumor environments.
