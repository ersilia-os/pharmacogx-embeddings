## Gene Summary
PNOC, standing for "prepronociceptin," encodes the preproprotein that is processed to yield nociceptin, also known as orphanin FQ. This peptide neurotransmitter plays a critical role in various physiological processes including pain modulation, stress response, and the regulation of the immune system. PNOC is highly expressed in various regions of the human brain, including the hypothalamus and frontal cortex, asserting its significance in neural pathways and neurotransmission.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Nociceptin, the peptide derived from PNOC, binds to the NOP receptor, a G-protein coupled receptor, which is involved in a wide range of biological functions and signaling pathways. The interaction between nociceptin and its receptor is significant in the context of pain management, anxiety, and drug dependence. Disorders associated with dysregulation of this system include inflammatory conditions and potentially neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia or depression, although direct associations with PNOC variations require further investigation.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of PNOC, although an emerging area, involves examining how variations in the PNOC gene might influence responses to drugs interacting with opioid systems, including those used in pain management. Since the nociceptin/orphanin system plays a role in modulating the effects of classical opioids, genetic differences in PNOC could conceivably impact the efficacy and safety profile of opioid analgesics. Further research into PNOC could potentially lead to more personalized approaches in treating pain or opioid addiction, highlighting the importance of genetic factors in opioid receptor pathway interactions.
