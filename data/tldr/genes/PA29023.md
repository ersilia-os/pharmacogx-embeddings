## Gene Summary
GSTM2 (Glutathione S-transferase Mu 2) is a member of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family of enzymes, which play a crucial role in detoxification by catalyzing the conjugation of glutathione to a wide array of substrates. This detoxification activity helps in the metabolism of xenobiotics, which include drugs and environmental toxins, and also protects against oxidative stress. GSTM2 is expressed in many tissues with prominent levels in the liver, which is a key organ for detoxification processes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
GSTM2 is involved primarily in the metabolism of carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins, and products of oxidative stress. The enzyme is part of the cytosolic glutathione S-transferase pathway. Dysfunction or altered expression of GSTM2 has been implicated in various diseases including cancers and cardiovascular diseases due to its role in detoxification and antioxidant defenses. Moreover, genetic variants in GSTM2 can influence individual responses to environmental pollutants and susceptibility to toxicities.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, GSTM2's role is highlighted in the context of response to chemotherapy drugs. Individuals with variations in the GSTM2 gene can exhibit different levels of effectiveness and toxicity in response to drugs such as cisplatin and busulfan. These drugs are detoxified by GST enzymes, influencing their therapeutic levels and side effects. As such, GSTM2 is considered in pharmacogenomics studies focusing on personalized medicine approaches, especially in oncology, to optimize drug efficacy and minimize adverse effects based on individual genetic profiles.
