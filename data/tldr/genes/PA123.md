## Gene Summary
CYP2B6, officially known as Cytochrome P450 2B6, belongs to the Cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes, which are vital for the metabolism of a wide variety of substances including drugs, toxins, and endogenous substrates. CYP2B6 is predominantly expressed in the liver but can also be found in other tissues such as the lungs and brain. This enzyme is known for its significant inter-individual variability in expression and activity, which can affect drug metabolism rates. The genetic polymorphisms within CYP2B6 affect enzyme function and have implications in drug metabolism and disease risk.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CYP2B6 is involved in the metabolism of several clinically important drugs as well as in the activation and detoxification of various environmental chemicals and carcinogens. It plays a critical role in the metabolic pathways of drugs such as cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and nevirapine. In terms of disease associations, variations in this gene have been linked to differences in drug efficacy and toxicity, contributing to conditions such as drug-induced liver injury. The enzyme is also part of the complex network of drug metabolism that includes multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes, influencing drug-drug interactions.

## Pharmacogenetics
CYP2B6 is centerpiece in pharmacogenetics, primarily due to its impact on the metabolism of a broad spectrum of drugs. For example, it metabolizes efavirenz and nevirapine, which are non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors used in HIV therapy. Genetic variations in CYP2B6 can lead to differing metabolic rates, significantly influencing drug plasma levels and therapeutic outcomes. Poor metabolizers may experience higher drug exposure, leading to increased risk of adverse effects, while rapid metabolizers may have reduced drug levels and possibly insufficient therapeutic efficacy. Methadone, used for opioid dependency, and bupropion, an antidepressant, are also significantly metabolized by CYP2B6, with genetic variations affecting their efficacy and tolerability. These pharmacogenetic insights are crucial for guiding dosing decisions and optimizing therapeutic strategies.
