## Gene Summary
CYB5R1, also known as Cytochrome b5 Reductase 1, is a gene that encodes an enzyme involved in the metabolism of various substrates including drugs, steroids, and lipids through its role in electron transport. It is present in the endoplasmic reticulum and is critical in maintaining the ratio of reduced to oxidized cytochrome b5, which impacts several metabolic pathways. Expression of CYB5R1 is ubiquitous but shows higher levels in tissues such as the liver, which have high metabolic activity.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CYB5R1 plays a significant role in drug metabolism, particularly in the reduction of methemoglobin and the activation of several drug metabolizing enzymes. Diseases associated with defects in CYB5R1 include methemoglobinemia, characterized by an abnormal amount of methemoglobin which leads to symptoms like cyanosis. This gene is involved in various biochemical pathways including fatty acid desaturation and steroid hormone synthesis. Its activity affects the efficacy and toxicity of several drugs, influencing clinical outcomes in pharmacotherapy.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, CYB5R1 has implications mainly tied to its role in the metabolism and effectiveness of drugs prone to redox reactions. It is notable for its impact on drugs that can induce methemoglobinemia such as aniline derivatives, dapsone, and certain local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine). Variability in CYB5R1 function can alter individual responses to these drugs, affecting both efficacy and safety. Thus, understanding genetic variations in CYB5R1 can guide dosing and choice of medication to minimize adverse effects and optimize therapeutic efficacy.
