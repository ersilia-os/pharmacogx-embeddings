## Gene Summary
APEH, or Acylaminoacyl-Peptidase, is an enzyme encoded by the APEH gene in humans. It is involved in the proteolytic processing of N-acylated or acetylated proteins by removing acetyl-amino acids from the N-terminus of specific peptide substrates, thereby playing a critical role in maintaining metabolic stability within the cell. APEH is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, with particularly high expression in liver and kidneys. This enzyme is also crucial in cellular protein turnover, especially in degrading damaged or misfolded proteins.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The APEH gene correlates with various biological pathways and diseases mainly due to its role in protein degradation. It is involved in amino acid degradation pathways, including the metabolism of leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Disorders associated with defects in APEH include certain metabolic disorders where protein accumulation or misfolding occurs, although specific, well-documented disease associations are still under investigation. Perturbations in APEH function are hypothesized to play a role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, possibly linked through its enzyme activity related to amyloid precursor proteins.

## Pharmacogenetics
From a pharmacogenetics perspective, APEH has not been traditionally linked to specific drug responses or adverse drug reactions in a direct manner. However, its role in protein degradation could theoretically influence the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are either protein-based or are modulators of protein synthesis and degradation. Nonetheless, research in this area remains nascent, and concrete pharmacogenetic associations involving APEH with particular drugs have yet to be established and validated in clinical or pharmacogenomic studies. Understanding these links could potentially offer new insights into optimizing therapies for diseases involving aberrant protein metabolism.
