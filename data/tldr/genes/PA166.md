## Gene Summary
FMO3, or flavin-containing monooxygenase 3, is an enzyme encoded by the FMO3 gene in humans. This gene plays a critical role in the oxidation of various xenobiotics, drugs, and endogenous compounds through the metabolic process involving NADPH and oxygen. FMO3 is primarily expressed in the liver, with significant implications for hepatic drug metabolism. Its enzymatic activity contributes to the detoxification of harmful compounds, including converting odorous compounds like trimethylamine (TMA) into non-odorous trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO).

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
FMO3 is implicated in several pharmacokinetic pathways, affecting the metabolism of numerous clinically important drugs. Its dysfunction or altered activity can result in disease states such as trimethylaminuria, commonly known as fish odor syndrome, where the body's failure to oxidize TMA leads to its accumulation and excretion in sweat, urine, and breath, causing a strong fishy odor. The phenotypic expression of FMO3 variants can influence drug response variability among individuals. FMO3 is part of the flavin-containing monooxygenase family which participates in phase I metabolism of xenobiotics and drugs, functioning parallel to cytochrome P450 enzymes.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, FMO3 has been studied for its role in the metabolism of several therapeutic drugs, including those used in cardiovascular and psychiatric treatments. Variants in FMO3 can significantly impact the therapeutic efficacy and safety of drugs metabolized by this enzyme. Important substrates include nicotine, which is metabolized to less active compounds, decreasing the pharmacological effect and potentially influencing smoking cessation therapy outcomes. Tamoxifen, an anti-estrogen used in the treatment of breast cancer, is also a substrate of FMO3, and variations in FMO3 activity might affect its therapeutic outcomes. Moreover, FMO3 pharmacogenetics has relevance in the risk assessment for drug-induced liver injuries and other adverse drug reactions linked to altered drug metabolism. The study and understanding of FMO3 variants continue to be crucial in the personalized medicine and personalized dosage adjustments based on genetic profiling.
