## Gene Summary
PI4KA, officially known as Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase alpha, is a key enzyme involved in the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), a critical lipid molecule that participates in various cellular processes such as membrane trafficking, signal transduction, and the regulation of ion channels and other enzymes. PI4KA is predominantly located at the plasma membrane and is involved in the production of PI4P which acts as a precursor for other important phosphoinositides. This enzyme plays a vital role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of Golgi and other organelles.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
PI4KA has been implicated in several pathways linked to cellular signaling and lipid metabolism. Disruption in its activity is observed in various pathological conditions including viral infections, where some viruses hijack the PI4KA pathway to facilitate their replication and survival. Moreover, mutations and dysregulation of PI4KA have been associated with diseases like hepatitis C and potentially other viral infections due to its role in creating a favorable environment for viral replication in host cells. The gene's involvement extends to pathways managing cellular architecture and lipid composition critical for various cellular functions.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of PI4KA primarily revolves around its role in viral diseases, especially in the context of antiviral therapy. Compounds targeting PI4KA are considered as potential therapeutic agents against viruses that rely on the PI4P produced by PI4KA for their life cycles. For example, inhibition of PI4KA has been proposed as a strategy to thwart the replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and other PI4P-dependent viruses. Although specific drugs targeting PI4KA are still under research and development, understanding individual genetic variations in the PI4KA gene may in the future help tailor treatments that either inhibit or modulate its activity to treat diseases associated with its dysfunction.
