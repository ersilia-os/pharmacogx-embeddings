## Gene Summary
TGFBR3, or Transforming Growth Factor Beta Receptor III, is a gene that encodes for a type III receptor of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily members. This receptor does not have a direct role in signal transduction but functions as an accessory to the TGF-beta signal. It binds to TGF-beta ligands and presents them to the type II receptor, enhancing the affinity of ligand binding and thus promoting the formation of the receptor complex necessary for signal propagation. TGFBR3 is ubiquitously expressed with higher levels in the heart, placenta, lung, skeletal muscle, and ovary, and it can be involved in a variety of cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
TGFBR3 is implicated in various signaling pathways primarily associated with cellular growth and development. Dysregulation of its expression has been linked to a variety of diseases, particularly cancer. In cancer, reduced expression of TGFBR3 has been observed in several types including breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers, where it is thought to play a tumor suppressor role. Moreover, TGFBR3 variations have been associated with developmental disorders and potentially with cardiovascular diseases due to its role in vascular development and maintenance. This receptor is part of pathways involving TGF-beta signaling, which is crucial for maintaining homeostasis in many cellular functions.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of TGFBR3 are not as extensive as those of other genes involved directly in drug metabolism or transport. However, understanding variations in TGFBR3 can be critical for therapeutic strategies, especially in oncology where modulation of TGF-beta signaling might alter therapeutic outcomes. No specific drugs targeting TGFBR3 have been distinctly highlighted, but agents that interact with the TGF-beta pathway might be influenced by the status of TGFBR3. This includes potentially using TGF-beta inhibitors or enhancers in a personalized treatment approach, depending on the expression and function of TGFBR3 in specific cancers. Thus, while direct associations with specific drugs are limited, the role of TGFBR3 in modifying responses to treatments involving the TGF-beta pathway is an area of active research.
