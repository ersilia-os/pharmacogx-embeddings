## Gene Summary
EXOC4, also known as Exocyst Complex Component 4, plays a crucial role in vesicle trafficking, specifically in the targeting and exocytosis of post-Golgi vesicles to specific docking sites on the plasma membrane. This is part of the exocyst complex, which is fundamental in mediating the tethering of exocytic vesicles. EXOC4 is essential for a range of exocytic processes in various cell types, indicating its widespread importance in cellular functioning and homeostasis. The gene that encodes the EXOC4 protein is located on human chromosome 7q22.1.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
EXOC4 is implicated in pathways associated with vesicular transport and has been found crucial in the context of cellular processes such as polarized secretion, neuronal transmission, and cytokinesis. Though not as extensively linked directly to specific diseases or drugs, disruptions or mutations in EXOC4 and its interactions have the potential to affect cellular secretion processes, possibly impacting conditions like metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Additionally, it could be linked to disorders that involve vesicle trafficking abnormalities.

## Pharmacogenetics
As of the latest updates, no significant pharmacogenetic associations involving EXOC4 have been conclusively established in relation to specific drugs. However, given its role in vesicle formation and trafficking, understanding the genetic variations in EXOC4 could potentially influence drug development and therapeutic strategies aimed at disorders of cellular exocytosis. Any future insights into EXOC4's pharmacogenetics could pave the way for targeted therapies that correct vesicular transport deficiencies or enhance cell type-specific drug delivery mechanisms where EXOC4 is a key player.
