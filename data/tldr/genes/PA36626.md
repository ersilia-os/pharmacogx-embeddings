## Gene Summary
CD40LG, also known as CD40 ligand or CD154, is a protein that is primarily expressed on the surface of activated T cells. This gene encodes a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily, which is essential for mediating a broad variety of immune and inflammatory responses. CD40LG binds to CD40 on antigen-presenting cells, leading to a variety of signaling pathways that result in immune activation, including the activation of macrophages and B cells, the latter resulting in immunoglobulin class switching.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in CD40LG are primarily associated with X-linked hyper IgM syndrome, a rare immunodeficiency characterized by an inability to produce high levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) due to a failure in immunoglobulin class switching. Patients often present with recurrent infections. The gene is involved in several important immune pathways, including but not limited to, the CD40/CD40L signaling pathway which plays a pivotal role in both humoral and cellular immunity. Due to its central role in immune responses, the pathway involving CD40LG is also implicated in autoimmune diseases, transplant rejection, and cancer.

## Pharmacogenetics
Given its fundamental role in immunoregulation, CD40LG and its interactions are critical in the pharmacogenetics of immune-related treatments including immunotherapies and vaccines. Allelic variations and expression levels of CD40LG may influence the effectiveness and side-effect profiles of treatments targeting the CD40/CD40L pathway. Currently, therapeutic targeting of CD40LG involves antagonists and antibodies designed to mitigate hyperactive immune responses seen in autoimmune diseases and prevent graft rejection. Specific drugs that interact with or are influenced by CD40LG mechanisms include experimental agents used in the modulation of immune responses and vaccine enhancement strategies, although no specific commercially available drugs are mentioned currently in mainstream pharmacogenetic databases.
