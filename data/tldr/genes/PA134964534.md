## Gene Summary
MOCOS (Molybdenum Cofactor Sulfurase) is an enzyme that plays an essential role in purine metabolism. This enzyme is required for the conversion of inactive molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) to its active sulfated form. A critical pathway that MOCOS is involved in is the catalysis of the oxidation state changes in molybdenum (Mo) at the molybdenum cofactor's sulfur-binding site. MOCOS is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression levels in the liver and kidney where significant metabolic activities occur.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
MOCOS deficiency or dysfunction can lead to several metabolic disorders, most notably xanthinuria type II. This rare inheritable disorder typically exhibits reduced activity of the enzyme xanthine dehydrogenase, one of several enzymes requiring a properly sulfated molybdenum cofactor. Individuals with this condition often exhibit symptoms such as the accumulation of xanthine in the urine, leading to kidney stones, and in some cases, can lead to kidney failure. The pathway disruptions due to MOCOS deficiencies mainly affect purine decomposition, resulting in alterations in uric acid levels and increased concentration of xanthine and hypoxanthine in blood and urine.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic implications of MOCOS mainly relate to its impact on drug metabolism pathways that require molybdenum cofactor. Although specific drugs known to be directly affected by MOCOS mutations or variability are not well-documented, its pivotal role in activating enzymes like xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase suggests that MOCOS could indirectly influence the metabolism of drugs that are substrates for these enzymes. For example, altered MOCOS function could hypothetically affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs such as azathioprine and mercaptopurine which are metabolized by xanthine oxidase. Further research is needed to elucidate clear pharmacogenetic associations of MOCOS with these or other medications.
