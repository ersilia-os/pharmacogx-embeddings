## Gene Summary
SLC1A4, also known as solute carrier family 1 member 4, is a gene that encodes an amino acid transporter protein, specifically involved in the transport of neutral amino acids including alanine, serine, and cysteine. This protein is integral to the plasma membrane and plays a critical role in transporting these amino acids across the cell membranes primarily in the brain and peripheral tissues. It is essential for maintaining the proper balance of amino acids needed for various metabolic processes and neurotransmitter synthesis.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SLC1A4 has been implicated in several neurological disorders due to its role in amino acid transport in the brain. Abnormal function or expression of this gene can affect amino acid availability and thus influence neurotransmitter levels, potentially contributing to diseases such as schizophrenia or epilepsy. The gene is involved in the alanine, serine, and cysteine metabolism pathways, which are crucial for synthesizing proteins and producing energy among other cellular functions. Disturbances in these pathways can also lead to metabolic disorders. 

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of SLC1A4 pertains mainly to its influence on the availability of amino acids necessary for neurotransmitter synthesis and the impact on metabolic processes. While there are not many direct associations with specific drugs, understanding the transport and regulation mechanism of SLC1A4 may be crucial for treatments targeting metabolic and neurological disorders where neurotransmitter balance is vital. Although direct drug associations are minimal, research in this area could lead to potential therapeutic targets or influence dosing and effectiveness of drugs treating related conditions.
