## Gene Summary
ADGRL3, also known as Latrophilin 3, is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This gene plays a crucial role in the development and function of the nervous system. It is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, regions known for their involvement in cognitive functions and memory. ADGRL3 is believed to mediate intercellular interactions and signal transduction processes that are essential for neural connectivity and brain architecture.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ADGRL3 has been linked to various neuropsychiatric conditions, notably attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Studies suggest that genetic variations in this gene may influence susceptibility to ADHD. The protein encoded by ADGRL3 engages in significant neurological pathways, including those governing synapse organization and neuron-neuron interactions. Additionally, its role in drug addiction and behavioral responses has been explored, indicating its broader impact on neurobiological phenotypes.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of ADGRL3 predominantly concerns its association with the efficacy and response to medications used in treating ADHD, such as methylphenidate and atomoxetine. Variants within or near the ADGRL3 gene have been studied for their potential to predict the therapeutic outcomes of these drugs. Individuals with certain genetic makeups affecting ADGRL3 expression or function might experience variations in drug efficacy or risk profiles, leading to a personalized approach in managing ADHD based on ADGRL3 genotypic data. Additionally, understanding ADGRL3's pharmacogenetic profile can aid in optimizing treatment plans and enhancing therapeutic effectiveness by tailoring interventions to genetic predispositions.
