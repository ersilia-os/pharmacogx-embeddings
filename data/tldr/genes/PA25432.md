## Gene Summary
BSCL2, also known as Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy 2, encodes the protein seipin, which is crucial in lipid droplet formation and lipid metabolism. The gene is predominantly expressed in tissues involved in lipid metabolism, including adipose tissue, liver, and the central nervous system. Mutations in BSCL2 are primarily associated with severe disorders of adipose tissue distribution.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The most prominent disease associated with BSCL2 is Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy type 2 (BSCL2), a rare disorder characterized by almost complete absence of adipose tissue and severe insulin resistance. Other phenotypes linked to mutations in this gene include neurodegenerative disorders, such as a subtype of hereditary spastic paraplegia. BSCL2-related pathways focus on lipid storage mechanisms and metabolic processes, underscoring its role in normal metabolic functioning and energy homeostasis.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is limited specific pharmacogenetic data related to BSCL2. The primary focus is on managing the clinical symptoms of the associated diseases, particularly diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia in patients with lipodystrophy. Drugs used in the management, such as insulin or antidiabetic agents like metformin, are chosen based on clinical symptoms rather than specific pharmacogenetic markers in BSCL2. Research into the pharmacogenetics of BSCL2 may provide new insights into personalized treatments for lipid management and diabetes, but currently, there are no direct pharmacogenetic associations with specific drugs.
