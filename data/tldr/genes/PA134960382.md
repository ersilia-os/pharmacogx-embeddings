## Gene Summary
CFHR4, or Complement Factor H-Related 4, is a member of the complement factor H protein family, which plays a critical role in regulation of the complement cascade, particularly in the alternative pathway of complement activation. CFHR4 is primarily expressed in the liver, and its protein product acts by competing with complement factor H for binding to C3b and C3d, thus potentially modulating complement activation. This gene is a part of the regulators of the complement activation (RCA) gene cluster located on chromosome 1.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CFHR4 has been implicated in several pathophysiological conditions, primarily related to inflammatory responses and age-related diseases. Dysregulation of CFHR4, either through genetic variation or differential expression, has been associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (aHUS), and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The geneâ€™s involvement in disease typically centers around its role in the complement system, specifically in how it modulates inflammation and immune responses. The gene is also part of research into broader pathways, including those governing immune system disorders and complement activation.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, specific pharmacogenetic associations involving CFHR4 and particular drugs have not been extensively documented. However, considering the gene's pivotal role in the regulation of the complement system and the associated diseases, future pharmacogenetic studies could investigate how genetic variations in CFHR4 might influence treatment responses in disorders like AMD or aHUS where complement dysregulation is a factor. Such studies would potentially tailor therapeutics aimed at modulating complement activity, enhancing the efficacy and safety of treatments in genetically diverse populations.
