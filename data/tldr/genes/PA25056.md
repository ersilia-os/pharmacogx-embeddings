## Gene Summary
ASPH, or Aspartate Beta-Hydroxylase, encodes a calcium-dependent enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of several proteins by catalyzing the hydroxylation of aspartyl and asparaginyl residues. This modification is critical for the proper function of the proteins involved. ASPH is ubiquitously expressed but shows higher levels in the liver, heart, and pancreas. The gene is particularly significant in developmental processes and cell signaling pathways, influencing cell migration, adhesion, and proliferation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ASPH is implicated in various cellular processes and pathways related to developmental anomalies and diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma, bile duct cancer, and possibly other tumor types due to its role in promoting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is a critical process in cancer metastasis. The enzyme's link to tissue development and cell signaling pathways also marks it as a potential player in congenital disorders affecting these systems, although specific phenotypic associations in hereditary diseases are less clear.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, ASPH has not been extensively studied compared to other genes directly linked to drug metabolism or drug targets. However, its role in diseases like cancer suggests it may become a target for therapeutics aimed at inhibiting its enzymatic activity to prevent or reduce tumor progression and metastasis. Future drug developments focusing on ASPH inhibitors could provide significant benefits in treating ASPH-related malignancies, offering a new avenue for intervention in cancer therapy. Nonetheless, associations with specific drugs are not well documented as of the current scientific literature, highlighting an area for potential future research.
