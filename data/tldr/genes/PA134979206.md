## Gene Summary
SUMO4, or Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier 4, is a member of the SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) gene family, involved in the post-translational modification process known as sumoylation. SUMO proteins, like SUMO4, are attached to other proteins to modify their function, location, or stability. SUMO4, unlike its more ubiquitously expressed relatives SUMO1-3, exhibits a more restricted expression profile, primarily localized in organs like the kidney and lymph nodes. This gene is notably involved in the regulation of nuclear transport, cellular structure maintenance, and responses to stress.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SUMO4 plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including protein stability, transcriptional regulation, and immune response. The modification of proteins by SUMO4 has implications in multiple pathways, notably those related to inflammation and the immune response. Mutations and expression variations in SUMO4 have been linked with several autoimmune diseases, including Type 1 diabetes and systemic lupus erythematosus. These associations are believed to arise from its role in NF-κB pathway regulation, a key pathway in immune response and inflammation.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the realm of pharmacogenetics, SUMO4’s role is emerging but not yet fully clear. Given its involvement with the NF-κB pathway, drugs targeting this pathway could potentially be affected by genetic variations in SUMO4. This could modify therapeutic effectiveness or risk profile of these drugs, influencing patient drug responses in inflammatory or autoimmune conditions. Although specific drug associations are still under study, the gene's influence on immune modulation points towards potential implications in the personalized treatment of autoimmune disorders. Continued research is essential to establish clear pharmacogenetic links and their impact on drug efficacy and safety.
