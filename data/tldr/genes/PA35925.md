## Gene Summary
SLC7A7, known as Solute Carrier Family 7 Member 7, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the transport of amino acids across cell membranes. This gene is a member of the solute carrier family, which facilitates the transport of various molecules across cellular membranes. Specifically, SLC7A7 is part of a heterodimeric amino acid transporter, linking with the 4F2 heavy chain (SLC3A2), primarily responsible for the sodium-independent transport of large neutral amino acids. It is crucial for transporting amino acids necessary for proper cellular function and development. This gene is widely expressed in various tissues, notably in the lungs, kidneys, and skeletal muscle.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in SLC7A7 are associated with a rare autosomal recessive disorder called Lysinuric Protein Intolerance (LPI). This condition is characterized by an inability to effectively transport certain amino acids into cells, leading to hyperammonemia, protein intolerance, failure to thrive, muscle hypotonia, and hepatosplenomegaly. Metabolic and dietary management are critical for individuals with this condition. The pathways involving SLC7A7 include amino acid transportation mechanisms and nitrogen metabolism processes. Its dysfunction disrupts amino acid homeostasis and cellular nutrition, affecting overall metabolism and development.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of SLC7A7 primarily relate to its role in affecting nutrient and amino acid absorption, which can indirectly influence the efficacy and toxicity of various drugs, especially those metabolized through amino acid-related pathways. Specific drug interactions or associations in a pharmacogenetic context, however, have not been extensively documented compared to its clear impact on metabolic disorders such as Lysinuric Protein Intolerance. Understanding the gene's function helps predict and manage potential metabolic disturbances in patients receiving nutritional supplements or treatments affecting amino acid metabolism. Nonetheless, direct pharmacogenetic correlations with specific drugs require further research to elucidate.
