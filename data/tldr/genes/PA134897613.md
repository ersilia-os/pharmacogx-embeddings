## Gene Summary
ENOSF1, or enolase superfamily member 1, is a gene located on chromosome 22 that is implicated in cellular metabolism. It encodes a protein thought to be involved in the metabolic processes, possibly relating to nucleotide metabolism given its link with the thiamine metabolism pathway. ENOSF1 has raised interest due to its regulation by the TSIX gene and its association with the antitumor activity of an enzyme inhibitor used in cancer chemotherapy.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ENOSF1 is not directly linked to a specific disease but is noteworthy in cancer research. The gene is also situated in a critical region synergistically affected by genomic elements involved in different types of cancer. It participates in metabolic pathways, predominantly those involving thiamine, which is vital for energy metabolism and neural function. The alteration of its expression and function could potentially affect these biological pathways, highlighting its importance in areas of metabolism and its dysregulation in disease states.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic research involving ENOSF1 is primarily associated with the drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a chemotherapeutic agent used primarily in the treatment of cancer. ENOSF1 expression levels have been linked to the efficacy of 5-FU, particularly in colorectal cancer treatments. Variants within ENOSF1 may influence the metabolic processing of thiamine and subsequently affect the metabolism of 5-FU, leading to variations in drug efficacy and toxicity among individuals. Given the critical role of thiamine in numerous cellular processes, alterations in ENOSF1 could potentially impact the outcome of 5-FU-based chemotherapy, making it a target of interest for optimizing cancer treatment regimens.
