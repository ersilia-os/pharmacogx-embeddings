## Gene Summary
RRM2 (Ribonucleotide Reductase Regulatory Subunit M2) is a gene that encodes the M2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, an enzyme crucial for DNA synthesis. This enzyme converts ribonucleotides into deoxyribonucleotides, which are necessary building blocks for DNA replication and repair. The activity of RRM2 is tightly regulated during the cell cycle and is upregulated in the S phase to meet the increased demand for DNA synthesis. RRM2 also plays a role in determining cellular iron utilization and response to oxidative stress.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
RRM2 is closely associated with cancer proliferation, as its increased expression can drive the rapid cell division characteristic of tumors. It has been specifically linked to the pathogenesis of various cancers, including lung, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers. In terms of phenotypic implications, alterations in RRM2 expression levels can influence cell growth rates and susceptibility to cellular damage from external stresses. Pathway interactions largely center around nucleotide biosynthesis and DNA repair mechanisms, connecting also to broader signaling networks governing cell cycle and apoptosis. The geneâ€™s role in these pathways makes it a potential target for chemotherapeutic drugs.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of RRM2 primarily focuses on its implications in cancer treatment. Overexpression of RRM2 has been associated with resistance to antineoplastic agents, particularly those that rely on DNA damage to exert their effects. For instance, gemcitabine, a nucleoside analog used in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, has shown variable efficacy potentially linked to RRM2-mediated resistance mechanisms. Similarly, alterations in RRM2 expression impact the effectiveness of other chemotherapeutic drugs like hydroxyurea. Studies have suggested that RRM2 could be a predictive biomarker for the response to these drugs, although confirmatory studies and clinical validations are required to fully integrate this into therapeutic decision-making. This pharmacogenetic information is crucial for optimizing personalized cancer therapy, aiming to improve outcomes by tailoring treatments based on genetic profiles.
