## Gene Summary
IGF2 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 2) is an important gene in human development and growth regulation. It encodes one of the several insulin-like growth peptides responsible for stimulating growth and development predominantly during fetal and postnatal stages. IGF2 acts as a potent mitogen for cellular growth and differentiation, especially in muscle, cartilage, bone, liver, kidney, nerve, skin, and lung tissues. It plays a significant role in the regulation of muscle growth and differentiation through its action on the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) and influencing cell survival and proliferation. The gene is located on chromosome 11p15.5 and is interestingly subject to genomic imprinting, usually being expressed only from the paternal allele.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The IGF2 gene is implicated in various biological pathways including cell growth, proliferation, and migration, influencing both normal physiology and disease conditions. Among diseases, IGF2 is known to be involved in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, a condition characterized by overgrowth and predisposition to tumor development, largely due to misregulation of gene expression within the 11p15 region, including IGF2 overexpression. IGF2 is also linked to several cancers, notably including colorectal and breast cancers, where overexpression has been observed. Moreover, increases in IGF2 signalling have been associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, influencing insulin sensitivity and metabolic pathways.

## Pharmacogenetics
While direct pharmacogenetic interactions of IGF2 with specific drugs are not extensively documented, its role in disease phenotypes such as cancer provides an indirect target for therapeutic intervention. Drugs that modulate the IGF1R/IGF2 pathway, such as growth hormone receptor blockers, indirectly affect the function and expression of IGF2. These include drugs like octreotide and lanreotide, which are used primarily in cases like acromegaly but also potentially impact cancer therapies involving IGF2-related pathways. Development of drugs targeting IGF2 pathways is considered a promising approach especially in oncology, aiming at reducing the mitogenic and pro-survival effects of IGF2 overexpression. Hence, understanding individual variations in the IGF2 gene could potentially enhance therapeutic efficacy and safety in treatments involving these pathways.
