## Gene Summary
BCHE, or butyrylcholinesterase, is an enzyme encoded by the BCHE gene in humans. This serine hydrolase is primarily found in the liver, and it is present in the plasma where it serves multiple physiological roles. Butyrylcholinesterase acts to hydrolyze esters of choline, playing a crucial role in the metabolism of various substances including drugs and toxins. It is structurally similar to acetylcholinesterase (ACHE), which is critical for breaking down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, but BCHE has a broader range of substrates and lower substrate specificity compared to ACHE.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
BCHE is implicated in the metabolism of several medications and is associated with conditions such as prolonged apnea after the administration of certain muscle relaxants like succinylcholine or mivacurium, which are used during general anesthesia. Mutations in BCHE can lead to butyrylcholinesterase deficiency, which may manifest clinically as increased sensitivity to specific muscle relaxants and certain ester local anesthetics. This genetic variability can influence drug efficacy and safety, altering risk profiles for adverse drug reactions. The enzyme is also studied in relation to other diseases, including obesity, Alzheimerâ€™s disease, and cardiovascular diseases, suggesting its role in various biological pathways and its potential as a biomarker.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of BCHE is particularly notable in the context of its interaction with specific anaesthetics like succinylcholine and mivacurium, where genetic variants can lead to atypical pharmacokinetic profiles. Certain alleles like BCHE*UUA and BCHE*K, which involve point mutations leading to amino acid substitutions, can result in a butyrylcholinesterase enzyme with significantly reduced activity. This decreased enzymatic activity can cause prolonged paralysis after administration of succinylcholine during surgeries, due to delayed metabolism of the drug. Thus, preoperative genotyping of BCHE might be recommended in some clinical settings to prevent potential adverse effects related to these agents. These pharmacogenetic insights enable personalized medical approaches, potentially improving patient safety and treatment efficacy.
