## Gene Summary
FIP1L1, or FIP1 Like 1, is a gene that encodes a subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex. This complex plays a key role in pre-mRNA 3'-end processing, which is critical for mRNA maturation and subsequent translation into proteins. The FIP1L1 protein specifically interacts with the poly(A) polymerase and is involved in recognizing polyadenylation signals in pre-mRNA, leading to the cleavage of mRNA precursors and the addition of poly(A) tails. Expression of FIP1L1 is found in various tissues but is particularly notable in hematopoietic tissues.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
FIP1L1 has been directly associated with hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), a group of conditions characterized by the persistent overproduction of eosinophils. This gene becomes highly relevant in disease due to its role in the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene, resulting from a chromosomal deletion. The fusion gene leads to the constitutive activation of PDGFRA kinase, promoting the proliferation of eosinophils. This abnormal activity is closely involved in the pathogenesis of HES and other related myeloproliferative disorders, making FIP1L1 a target of interest in therapeutic interventions.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, FIP1L1 is particularly significant due to its involvement in drug response linked to the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene. The fusion protein resulting from this gene alteration is sensitive to treatment with imatinib (Gleevec), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Imatinib has been successfully used to treat disorders associated with the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion, such as chronic eosinophilic leukemia and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome, due to its effectiveness in inhibiting the aberrant kinase activity. Precision medicine approaches targeting this fusion gene and its product emphasize the importance of genetic testing for appropriate and effective therapy management in affected patients.
