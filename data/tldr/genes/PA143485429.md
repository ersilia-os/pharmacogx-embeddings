## Gene Summary
CCDC77, or coiled-coil domain containing 77, is a gene whose specific biological functions are not thoroughly characterized yet. Expressed in multiple tissues, CCDC77 encodes a protein that shares structural motifs common to proteins that often perform roles in supporting cellular structure or in the organization of other protein complexes. Given the coiled-coil domain, CCDC77 might participate in protein-protein interactions, suggesting its involvement in various cellular processes possibly including signal transduction, vesicular transport, or the maintenance of the cytoskeleton integrity.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
There is limited information available about the specific interactions of drugs, diseases, or pathways directly involving CCDC77. Given its presumed role in cellular structural integrity and protein assembly, mutations or dysfunction in this gene could potentially be linked to cellular organization defects. However, without direct studies or strong evidence, these hypotheses remain speculative. Current databases and scientific literature do not provide concrete links to particular phenotypes or pathological conditions directly associated with this gene.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, the CCDC77 gene does not currently have established associations with specific drug responses or interactions. No known pharmacogene information directly ties the expression or modulation of this gene to the efficacy, metabolism, or toxicity of therapeutic compounds. This lack of data highlights a gap in current pharmacogenetic research and portrays CCDC77 as a potential novel area for future studies to understand any impacts it may have in drug response variability. Further research could explore whether CCDC77 influences drug actions or outcomes indirectly through its potential role in cellular mechanisms.
