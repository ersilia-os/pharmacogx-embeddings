## Gene Summary
LRP2, or low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2, also known as megalin, is a large endocytic receptor involved in the transport and metabolic regulation of a variety of ligands. This transmembrane glycoprotein is expressed primarily in absorptive epithelia, such as the renal proximal tubules and the small intestine, playing a key role in the reabsorption of nutrients, hormones, and vitamins. LRP2 is known for its multidomain structure that enables it to bind a wide array of diverse ligands, facilitating their cellular uptake and influencing signal transduction pathways.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The wide-ranging binding ability of megalin underlies its involvement in several pathological conditions, particularly those related to renal and neurological function. LRP2 dysfunction is implicated in Donnai-Barrow and Facio-oculo-acoustico-renal syndromes, diseases characterized by features such as diaphragmatic hernia, facial dysmorphism, and sensorineural hearing loss. Megalin is crucial in the renal processing of many proteins and small molecules; its loss results in low-molecular-weight proteinuria and other renal disorders. In terms of pathways, LRP2 is notably involved in the vitamin D metabolism pathway, which is essential for calcium homeostasis and bone health.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of LRP2 largely relate to its role in renal drug handling and its ability to influence drug toxicity and efficacy. For instance, its importance in the reabsorption of vitamin D and interaction with vitamin D binding protein can impact the pharmacokinetics of vitamin D analogs such as calcitriol. Despite its association with pharmaceutical effects, specific direct drug-gene interactions involving LRP2 are less documented compared to other genes in pharmacogenomic contexts. However, understanding LRP2â€™s broad endocytic and transport roles does underscore its potential influence on the systemic availability and renal clearance of a number of drugs, highlighting an area ripe for further pharmacogenetic research.
