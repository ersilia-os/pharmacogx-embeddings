## Gene Summary
CYP46A1, also known as Cytochrome P450 Family 46 Subfamily A Member 1, is primarily expressed in the brain, where it functions as a cholesterol 24-hydroxylase. This enzyme is crucial for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis in the brain by converting cholesterol to 24S-hydroxycholesterol, which can cross the blood-brain barrier. This process is essential for normal brain function and has implications in various neurological conditions.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CYP46A1 is implicated in the metabolism of cholesterol, which plays a significant role in neuronal structure and function. Abnormalities in this gene have been associated with various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The enzyme's activity affects cholesterol balance, impacting neurodegenerative conditions where cholesterol metabolism is disrupted. Pathway involvement includes lipid metabolism pathways, specifically focusing on brain cholesterol clearance.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic studies have explored how variations in CYP46A1 may influence the risk and progression of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, potentially moderating the effectiveness of treatments that target cholesterol metabolism. While direct drug associations are limited, understanding CYP46A1 activity could impact the use of statins and other cholesterol-modifying agents in managing neurological conditions. There may be therapeutic potential in modulating CYP46A1 activity to alter disease progression in Alzheimer's disease and other brain cholesterol-related disorders.
