## Gene Summary
NRXN1, or Neurexin 1, is a gene that encodes a member of the neurexin family, proteins that function in the vertebrate nervous system as cell adhesion molecules and receptors. These proteins are pivotal in the formation of synapses, the critical communication ports between neurons. The NRXN1 protein exists in two major isoforms: a longer form (α) and a shorter form (β), both of which undergo alternative splicing, giving rise to a variety of transcripts that contribute to its diverse functions in synaptic specification and intercellular interaction.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Alterations in the NRXN1 gene have been associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. Notably, deletions or mutations in this gene are linked with autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, intellectual disability, and other developmental delays. These associations underline the crucial role of NRXN1 in proper cognitive and synaptic development. The gene's contribution to neuropsychiatric conditions highlights its involvement in critical neurological pathways, including synaptic transmission processes that affect neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the realm of pharmacogenetics, variations in the NRXN1 gene have implications primarily in the context of neuropsychiatric disorder treatments, though direct associations with specific drugs have yet to be extensively characterized. For instance, the genetic variations impacting the expression or function of NRXN1 could influence the efficacy and safety profiles of treatments for conditions like schizophrenia and autism. Understanding the interactions between NRXN1 genotypes and psychotropic drugs could lead to more personalized and effective therapeutic interventions, adjusting treatments based on genetic makeup to improve outcomes and minimize adverse effects.
