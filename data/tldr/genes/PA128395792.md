## Gene Summary
The gene DHRS4 (Dehydrogenase/Reductase 4) encode an enzyme involved in the NADP-dependent oxidation-reduction processes of alcohols and steroids. It is part of a gene cluster on chromosome 14 including three genes belonging to the dehydrogenase/reductase family. DHRS4 is ubiquitously expressed with significant levels in the liver, kidney, and heart. The enzyme is also implicated in retinol metabolism, converting retinal into retinol as part of the visual cycle and in the cellular response to oxidative stress by detoxifying aldehydes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
DHRS4 is associated with several metabolic pathways, prominently in the metabolism of retinoids and steroids. It plays a crucial role in vitamin A metabolism which is essential for vision, growth, cellular differentiation, and proliferation. There is also evidence suggesting its involvement in response to oxidative stress and possibly in the metabolism of xenobiotics. While specific diseases have not been strongly linked to DHRS4, its role in metabolic pathways suggests potential implications in disorders related to vitamin A deficiency or toxicity, and possibly in conditions influenced by oxidative stress.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics profile of DHRS4 is not extensively characterized in the context of clinical drug response or adverse drug reactions. Most known effects relate to its metabolic role in the body. However, considering its role in the metabolism of compounds like retinoids, it could potentially influence the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of drugs that are derivatives of vitamin A or those affecting the vitamin A pathway. Further research would be necessitated to clarify DhRS4's pharmacogenetic interactions and its implications in drug therapy, especially concerning drugs influencing retinol and retinal metabolism or those relying on redox reactions wherein DHRS4 could be indirectly involved.
