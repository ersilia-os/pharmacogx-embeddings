## Gene Summary
HLA-B, the human leukocyte antigen B, is a gene located on chromosome 6 that plays a critical role in the immune system as part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I system. It encodes a cell surface protein that is ubiquitous among nucleated cells in the body. HLA-B proteins are primarily involved in presenting peptides derived from intracellular proteins to the immune system, specifically to cytotoxic T cells. This enables the immune system to detect cells that are infected with viruses or transformed by cancer. The extreme polymorphism in the HLA-B gene is a key feature that allows for a diverse immune response, capable of responding to a wide array of pathogens.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
HLA-B is associated with various diseases, prominently including autoimmune disorders and drug hypersensitivity reactions. The gene's diversity is linked to differential susceptibilities to diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, Behcet's disease, and certain types of drug-induced hypersensitivity, like those triggered by abacavir, a drug used in the treatment of HIV. In immunopharmacology, particular HLA-B alleles play crucial roles in immune-mediated adverse drug reactions. For instance, the HLA-B*57:01 allele has been famously connected to severe reactions to abacavir. Additionally, the gene is involved in pathways pertaining to antigen processing and presentation, playing a pivotal role in the immune response modulation.

## Pharmacogenetics
From a pharmacogenetic perspective, HLA-B is highly significant in influencing individual responses to medications, particularly through its impact on immune-mediated drug reactions. Specific alleles of HLA-B, such as HLA-B*57:01, have been associated with hypersensitivity to abacavir. Patients carrying this allele are at high risk of developing a severe hypersensitivity reaction if treated with abacavir, making genetic screening a critical component of patient management before initiating abacavir therapy. Other notable associations include HLA-B*15:02 with carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, particularly in Asian populations. Such pharmacogenetic associations underscore the importance of considering HLA-B genotype in the personalized medicine context to optimize drug therapy and mitigate adverse effects.
