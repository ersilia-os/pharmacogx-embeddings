## Gene Summary
CYP4F2, part of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, is primarily involved in the metabolism of lipids, drugs, and other xenobiotic substances. It is mainly expressed in the liver but also found in other tissues like the intestines and kidneys. The enzyme encoded by CYP4F2 is specifically important in the metabolism of vitamin E and arachidonic acid, contributing to the synthesis of signaling molecules and modulation of inflammation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CYP4F2 interacts with various drugs through its role in metabolic pathways, especially influencing the metabolism of fatty acids and eicosanoids. Diseases associated with aberrations in CYP4F2 include hypertension and vascular disorders, which relate to its role in the regulation of blood pressure through fatty acid metabolism. The gene also influences the pharmacokinetics of specific drugs, thus impacting drug efficacy and safety.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, variants of CYP4F2 are of particular relevance to the dosing of warfarin, a commonly used anticoagulant. The V433M variant (rs2108622) in CYP4F2 has been linked to variations in warfarin dose requirements, with carriers often needing higher doses to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation. This variant has been included in some warfarin dosing algorithms. Additionally, CYP4F2 polymorphisms can affect the metabolism of other drugs, including certain antihypertensives, though these interactions are less well-characterized than those with warfarin. Understanding CYP4F2 genetics is crucial for optimizing therapy with certain medications and minimizing adverse effects.
