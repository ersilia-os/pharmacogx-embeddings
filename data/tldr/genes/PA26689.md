## Gene Summary
CNTN5, or Contactin 5, is a member of the contactin family, which includes glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell adhesion molecules. These proteins play important roles in the development of the nervous system, particularly in neurogenesis, axon guidance, and synaptogenesis. The expression of CNTN5 is primarily found in the brain, suggesting its critical role in neuronal functions. It is known to interact mainly via its extracellular domain with other proteins, contributing to cell-cell communication within the nervous system.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CNTN5 is linked to various neurological conditions. For instance, mutations or altered expression of CNTN5 are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and intellectual disabilities. Phenotypically, changes in CNTN5 may influence cognitive functions and neurodevelopmental outcomes. The specific biological pathways involving CNTN5 largely pertain to its role in neural network structuring and neuroplasticity. Its involvement in synaptic assembly and maintenance are particularly notable, as these processes are fundamental for proper cognitive and behavioural functions.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, specific pharmacogenetic associations involving CNTN5 and direct drug interactions are limited and not well-documented. However, given its roles in neurodevelopment and synaptic function, understanding variations in CNTN5 may eventually contribute to personalized therapeutic strategies for treating neurodevelopmental disorders. Research into how CNTN5 genetic variations modify the neurological phenotype could pave the way for targeted drug development, potentially affecting the efficacy and safety of treatments for disorders like autism and intellectual disability.
