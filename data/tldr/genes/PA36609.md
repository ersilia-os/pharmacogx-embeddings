## Gene Summary
TNFRSF1A, also known as Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily Member 1A, plays a crucial role in mediating cellular responses to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). This receptor is involved in the complex signaling pathways that activate inflammatory, apoptotic, and immune processes. Widely expressed across various cell types, TNFRSF1A is instrumental in the development and function of several immune cell types, regulation of cell survival, and induction of apoptosis. Being a receptor for TNF-α, it is fundamental to mechanisms that control cellular responses to external stress and infection.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
TNFRSF1A is associated with several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, most notably with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and TNF Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS), a rare autosomal dominant condition characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and inflammation. This gene is also linked to systemic lupus erythematosus and potentially to outcomes in infections like sepsis. The TNF-α signaling pathways involving TNFRSF1A include activation of NF-κB, which plays a pivotal role in inflammation and immune response regulation. The dysregulation of TNFRSF1A is connected to these pathways and can lead to severe inflammatory reactions and tissue damage.

## Pharmacogenetics
TNFRSF1A genetics can influence the efficacy and safety of drugs used to manage inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. In particular, biologic therapies targeting TNF-α, such as infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept, are significantly affected by variations in TNFRSF1A. Specific mutations or variants in TNFRSF1A have been associated with altered responses to these therapies. For instance, certain polymorphisms in TNFRSF1A can predict responsiveness or resistance to anti-TNF therapies in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. Understanding the genetic profile of TNFRSF1A can thus provide critical insights into personalized medicine approaches, potentially guiding the choice and dosage of TNF-α inhibitors to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects.
