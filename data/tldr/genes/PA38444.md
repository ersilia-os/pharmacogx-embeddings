## Gene Summary
CPA6 (Carboxypeptidase A6) is an enzyme encoded by the CPA6 gene in humans. This enzyme is a member of the metallocarboxypeptidase family, known for their role in the cleavage of C-terminal amino acids in proteins and peptides. CPA6 is unique among the carboxypeptidases in that it is expressed predominantly in the brain, suggesting specialized functions in the central nervous system. The gene displays a specific pattern of expression in neuronal cells and has been implicated in modulating neuronal maturation and circuit formation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The dysregulation of CPA6 has been linked to a range of neurological disorders. Notably, mutations in the CPA6 gene are associated with epilepsy, particularly familial temporal lobe epilepsy. This gene is also being studied for its potential involvement in developmental disorders and neurological pathologies related to cognitive functions and behavior. In terms of pathways, CPA6 is involved in peptide modification and neurotransmitter processing, which are critical for normal brain function and development.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of CPA6 is an area of growing interest, particularly in the context of treating epilepsy. Given CPA6's role in brain-specific processes, drugs targeting this enzyme might offer new therapeutic options for epilepsy and other neurological disorders. However, as of the last update, specific pharmacogenetic interactions involving direct inhibitors or modulators of CPA6 with clinical drugs have not been widely reported. Research in this area may provide insights into tailored treatments that could ameliorate symptoms related to CPA6 dysfunction or exploit its activity for therapeutic benefits.
