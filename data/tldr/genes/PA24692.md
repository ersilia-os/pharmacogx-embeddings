## Gene Summary
**ALDH1A1** (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family Member A1) is an enzyme encoded by the ALDH1A1 gene in humans. This enzyme is crucial for oxidizing aldehydes to carboxylic acids, and it plays a vital role in retinoic acid biosynthesis, which is essential for cell differentiation and proliferation. This gene is primarily expressed in liver and kidney tissues, and it also contributes to the metabolism of alcohol, serving as a protector against alcohol-related toxicity. In addition, ALDH1A1 contributes to the systemic detoxification pathway that mitigates the accumulation of toxic metabolites and reactive aldehydes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The ALDH1A1 enzyme is associated with several key biological pathways, including metabolism of alcohol, conversion of retinal to retinoic acid, and the cellular response to oxidative stress. It has implications in various disease states notably in cancer, where its elevated expression in some cancer stem cells correlates with a poor prognosis and can affect response to chemotherapy. Diseases such as alcohol dependence and metabolic disorders also display an association with variations in ALDH1A1 activity. Dysfunction of this gene leads to increased susceptibility to alcohol-related liver conditions and certain types of cancers due to impaired detoxification pathways.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, ALDH1A1 is important mainly due to its role in detoxification and metabolism of substances, including drugs. Its activity influences the pharmacokinetics of alcohol, potentially impacting the efficacy and toxicity of drugs metabolized by the aldehyde dehydrogenase pathway. The enzyme's level in certain cancers has been studied for its potential influence on resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, such as cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide, where ALDH1A1 activity may protect cancer cells from alkylating agents. However, the direct associations with specific drugs in a clinical pharmacogenetic context remain to be more precisely defined outside the field of oncology. The manipulation of ALDH1A1 activity is also a potential target for cancer therapy aiming to sensitize tumor cells to treatment.
