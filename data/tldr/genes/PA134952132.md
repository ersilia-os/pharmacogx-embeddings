## Gene Summary
GNL3, also known as Guanine Nucleotide Binding Protein-Like 3 (Nucleolar), is a gene encoding a member of the G protein family, which are known for their role in signal transduction. The GNL3 protein, specifically, is involved in fundamental cellular processes, including protein synthesis, cell proliferation, and cell cycle regulation. It is particularly noted for its role in ribosome biogenesis and its presence predominantly in the nucleolus. GNL3 has been implicated as a potential oncogene, as its expression levels have been found to be elevated in various cancer types, possibly affecting tumor growth and progression.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
GNL3 is associated with several key cellular pathways, including those governing cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. The proteinâ€™s role in ribosome biogenesis also ties it to pathways involving protein synthesis and cellular growth. Aberrant expression of GNL3 is linked with different cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma and possibly colorectal cancer. Studies suggest that overexpression of GNL3 might influence cancer phenotype, including proliferation rates and metastatic potential. 

## Pharmacogenetics
While the direct pharmacogenetic associations of GNL3 with specific drugs are not extensively documented, the gene's role in cancer biology suggests potential implications for cancer therapeutics, particularly in the context of targeted therapy and personalized medicine. Understanding alterations in GNL3 expression could potentially lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies, targeting mechanisms of ribosomal biogenesis or modulating the cell cycle in cancer cells. Further research is needed to establish specific pharmacogenetic relationships and to explore GNL3 as a therapeutic target or biomarker in cancer treatment.
