## Gene Summary
ERBB3, also known as HER3 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 3), is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptor tyrosine kinases. This gene is essential for proper development and growth regulation, and it encodes a receptor for the family of neuregulins. ERBB3 is unique among the EGFR family members because it has impaired kinase activity and relies on heterodimerization with other EGFR family members, such as ERBB2, to initiate downstream signaling. Expression of ERBB3 is noted particularly in tissues involved in neural and cardiac development.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ERBB3 has been implicated in various forms of cancer, especially breast, gastric, and ovarian cancers. This gene plays a role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration, mechanisms that are frequently exploited in cancer development. In breast cancer, the overexpression of ERBB3 and its interaction with ERBB2 is associated with aggressive tumor progression and poor prognosis. It also participates in critical pathway signaling including the PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways, which are vital for cell survival and metabolism.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, ERBB3's relevance is most notable in cancer treatment where targeted therapy against the ERBB family, particularly HER2 (ERBB2), has proven beneficial. Drugs specifically designed to inhibit ERBB2, such as Trastuzumab and Lapatinib, indirectly affect ERBB3 signaling due to the dependency of ERBB3 on ERBB2 for activating signaling cascades. Polymorphisms in ERBB3 have shown varying patient responses to certain therapies. For instance, specific variants of ERBB3 are associated with differential responses to EGFR inhibitors, influencing treatment outcomes for cancer patients. This highlights the potential therapeutic importance of considering ERBB3 gene variations in personalized medicine approaches.
