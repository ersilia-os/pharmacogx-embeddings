## Gene Summary
GRAMD1B (GRAM Domain Containing 1B) is a gene that encodes a protein which is believed to play a role in cellular processes such as lipid metabolism and transport. The GRAM domain is characteristic of proteins involved in membrane-related processes, often associated with interactions with phospholipids. There is curious research interest around its potential role in signaling pathways that influence metabolic and cellular homeostasis. GRAMD1B expression is noted across various tissues, with possible regulatory functions affecting membrane composition and dynamics.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
GRAMD1B is not prominently linked to specific drugs or diseases in the most direct sense as of current research. However, considering its putative role in lipid handling, it may influence conditions indirectly associated with lipid metabolism disorders, such as cardiovascular diseases or obesity. Phenotypically, genetic variations in GRAMD1B could influence cellular mechanisms and lipid profiles, potentially impacting an individual's susceptibility to metabolic syndromes. Pathway involvement is more conceivable in lipid transport and homeostasis, yet clear associations require more detailed research and validation.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics profile of GRAMD1B is still largely uncharted as of the current understanding. Direct pharmacogenetic associations between GRAMD1B gene variations and drug responses or interactions are not extensively documented. Continued exploration in genetic studies could elucidate potential links, especially considering its involvement in lipid pathways which are often targets for therapeutic interventions. Developments in this area could potentially reveal how variations in GRAMD1B affect the efficacy or metabolism of drugs targeting lipid disorders or related metabolic pathways.
