## Gene Summary
**SFRP5** (Secreted Frizzled-Related Protein 5) is a member of the SFRP family that functions as a modulator in the Wnt signaling pathway. By binding to Wnt proteins, SFRP5 effectively inhibits Wnt-mediated pathways which are crucial in various developmental processes, tissue homeostasis, and cell proliferation. Its expression is noted in several tissues, but it is particularly significant in adipose tissue where it plays a role in regulating metabolic functions and adipogenesis.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SFRP5 has been studied mainly in the context of metabolic disorders, particularly diabetes and obesity. The gene has been implicated in the regulation of insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, which connects it to Type 2 diabetes and obesity-related complications. In terms of pathways, SFRP5 primarily interferes in the canonical Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling, known for its role in cell fate determination, migration, and polarity. The altered function or expression of SFRP5 is linked to adverse metabolic phenotypes and possibly to the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of SFRP5 predominantly concern its influence on metabolic pathways that could modify responses to treatments in metabolic conditions like diabetes and obesity. Although specific drug associations are not clearly defined, the understanding of SFRP5's function in metabolic regulation could potentially impact the effectiveness or the required dosages of antidiabetic drugs, such as metformin and thiazolidinediones. Additionally, because SFRP5 modulates inflammatory processes in adipose tissue, it could influence the pharmacodynamics of anti-inflammatory drugs in the context of obesity-related inflammation. Further research is required to establish concrete pharmacogenetic links with specific therapeutic agents.
