## Gene Summary
FOLR3, or folate receptor gamma, is a member of the folate receptor family, which also includes FOLR1 and FOLR2. This gene encodes a protein that is attached to the cell surface and is involved in the uptake and transport of folic acid, an essential vitamin B that is crucial for numerous biological functions including DNA synthesis and repair. FOLR3 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic tissues and has implications in immune system functioning. Unlike FOLR1 and FOLR2, FOLR3 is a GPI-anchored protein that binds to folates and mediates their transport into cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Although FOLR3 has not been as extensively studied as FOLR1 or FOLR2, it plays a role in the metabolism of folates, influencing conditions related to folate deficiency such as congenital malformations and some forms of anemia. In terms of disease association, alterations in the expression or function of FOLR3 could potentially impact immune responses or autoimmune conditions, although direct evidence linking FOLR3 to specific diseases is sparse. The gene is involved in the folate metabolic pathway which is crucial for cell division and growth. 

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic data specifically related to FOLR3 is limited compared to other folate receptors. However, given the gene's role in folate transport, it can be inferred that variations in FOLR3 might affect the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of drugs that interact with folate metabolism. For example, drugs such as methotrexate and other antifolates used in the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases could potentially be influenced by FOLR3 activity. Understanding the pharmacogenetic implications of FOLR3 might provide insights into individual responses to folate supplementation or antifolate therapy. Further research is needed to explicitly connect FOLR3 genetic variants with drug response.
