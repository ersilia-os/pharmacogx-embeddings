## Gene Summary
The gene **TTR** (Transthyretin) primarily functions to transport thyroxine (T4), a thyroid hormone, and retinol (vitamin A) by binding to retinol-binding protein. It is a tetrameric protein produced predominantly in the liver, and it also has a significant presence in the choroid plexus of the brain and in the retinal pigment epithelium of the eye. TTR is crucial for the transport of thyroid hormones to the brain and for maintaining vitamin A levels in the blood.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
TTR is clinically significant due to its association with familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), familial amyloid cardiomyopathy (FAC), and a form of senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA). These disorders arise from the deposition of amyloid fibrils, consisting primarily of misfolded TTR proteins, in bodily tissues. Mutations in TTR can lead to its destabilization and disassembly into monomers, which then misfold and form amyloid fibrils. The clinical manifestations vary but predominantly include neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, and gastrointestinal disturbances. In terms of pathways, TTR is involved in the transport and metabolism of thyroid hormones and retinol.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of TTR is valuable particularly in the context of treatment for TTR-related amyloidoses. Drugs like tafamidis, diflunisal, and patisiran are tailored to stabilize the tetrameric form of TTR or to reduce its production, thereby preventing misfolding and aggregation. Tafamidis works by binding selectively to thyroxine-binding sites on TTR, enhancing its stability and preventing dissociation into monomers. Patisiran functions by targeting RNA for TTR through an RNA interference mechanism, decreasing the production of both wild-type and mutant TTR. These interventions highlight a pharmacogenetic approach whereby the treatment is directly influenced by variations in the TTR gene itself, offering a highly personalized treatment strategy tailored to the genetic makeup of the patient.
