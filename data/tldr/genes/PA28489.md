## Gene Summary
GABRA1 is the gene encoding the alpha-1 subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA(A) receptor). This receptor is a key component of the major inhibitory neurotransmitter system in the brain. The GABRA1 subunit, when assembled with other subunits in the receptor complex, forms a ligand-gated chloride channel that mediates the inhibitory effects of GABA. Expression of GABRA1 is found primarily in the brain, particularly in regions involved in controlling excitability and anxiety levels.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
GABRA1 is linked to a variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions, reflecting its role in regulating neuronal excitability. Mutations in this gene have been associated with familial juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and other forms of epilepsy. The gene's influence extends to phenotypes affecting anxiety, sleep regulation, and the response to sedatives due to its modulation of inhibitory synaptic transmission. Pathway involvement primarily focuses on neurotransmitter release and reception frameworks, impacting GABAergic synapses and benzodiazepine pharmacology, among others.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of GABRA1 is especially relevant in the context of response to benzodiazepines, which are drugs used predominately for anxiety, seizures, and insomnia. These medications, including diazepam and lorazepam, exert their effects primarily through the GABA(A) receptors. Variants in the GABRA1 gene may affect the efficacy and safety profile of these drugs, influencing dosage requirements and risk of side effects. Although currently clinical guidelines specific for GABRA1 gene variants in drug use are limited, understanding individual differences in this gene could enhance personalized treatment strategies for conditions influenced by GABAergic dysfunction.
