## Gene Summary
HSD17B14 (Hydroxysteroid 17-Beta Dehydrogenase 14) is an enzyme encoded by the HSD17B14 gene in humans. It is predominantly involved in steroid metabolism, specifically playing a critical role in the conversion of ketosteroids to their respective hydroxysteroid forms by catalyzing the reduction of keto-groups to hydroxyl groups using NADPH as a cofactor. HSD17B14 is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in the liver, kidney, and heart. The enzyme has a preference for substrates such as estrone, converting it to the less active form estradiol, thereby playing a role in the regulation of estrogen activity in tissues.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
HSD17B14 is involved in important metabolic pathways including steroid metabolism and estrogen metabolism. The enzymeâ€™s role in these pathways can influence physiological processes such as reproductive functions and the hormonal regulation of various metabolic processes. While not directly linked to specific diseases, alterations in the expression and activity of HSD17B14 could potentially impact conditions related to estrogen metabolism, such as breast cancer or hormonal disorders. However, direct associations between HSD17B14 dysregulation and specific diseases remain under investigation.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of HSD17B14 has not been as extensively studied as those of other genes involved in drug metabolism. Given its role in steroid metabolism, variations in this gene could theoretically affect the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of drugs that interact with or are metabolized by steroid pathways. For example, drugs that modulate estrogen levels (such as certain hormone replacement therapies or contraceptives) might be influenced by the activity of HSD17B14. However, specific drug interactions and pharmacogenetic implications associated with HSD17B14 remain to be clearly established and warrant further research to determine the clinical significance of this gene in drug response and toxicity.
