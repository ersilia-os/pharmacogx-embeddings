## Gene Summary
ALDH1A3 is the official gene symbol for Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family Member A3. It encodes an enzyme that is part of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family, which is critical for the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids. ALDH1A3 plays a notable role in the biosynthesis of retinoic acid, a derivative of vitamin A that is essential for growth, vision, and tissue maintenance. The enzyme is expressed in various tissues, with significant levels in the eye and brain, suggesting its particular importance in the neural and visual development.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ALDH1A3 is implicated in several developmental disorders and cancers. Its role in converting retinaldehyde to retinoic acid positions it centrally in pathways influencing cellular differentiation and proliferation. Mutations and altered expression levels of ALDH1A3 have been associated with diseases such as microphthalmia, a developmental disorder of the eye, and various types of cancers including lung and breast cancer. The gene's involvement in critical developmental pathways like the retinoic acid signaling pathway underscores its importance in both normal development and disease states.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of ALDH1A3 revolves around its influence on retinoic acid metabolism, which can impact the efficacy and toxicity of drugs that modulate or are modulated by this pathway. Retinoids, such as all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, may be affected by the activity of ALDH1A3. Variations in ALDH1A3 expression or function can influence retinoid pharmacodynamics, potentially altering drug efficacy and patient response profiles. While direct pharmacogenetic associations between specific ALDH1A3 variants and drug responses are still under investigation, understanding its broader role in retinoic acid metabolism can guide therapeutic strategies involving retinoid drugs.
