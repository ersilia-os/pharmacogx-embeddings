## Gene Summary
SUGCT (succinyl-CoA:glutarate-CoA transferase) is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial enzyme principally involved in the catabolism of L-tryptophan and the synthesis of glutaryl-CoA. This gene holds a pivotal role in the tryptophan degradation pathway to acetyl-CoA, linking amino acid metabolism to energy production. SUGCT is expressed across various tissues but predominantly in the liver and kidneys, following the necessity for high metabolic function in these organs.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SUGCT functionally interfaces with key metabolic pathways, significantly influencing the glutarate and acyl-CoA metabolic processes. Disorders associated with dysfunctions of this gene include Glutaric Aciduria Type III, a rare metabolic disorder characterized by elevated levels of glutaric acid and glutaryl-CoA in urine. This condition often leads to clinical consequences affecting neurological and muscular systems due to toxic accumulations. The phenotypic implications of defects in SUGCT are critical primarily for energy production and amino acid metabolism.

## Pharmacogenetics
As of current knowledge, direct pharmacogenetic associations involving SUGCT and specific drugs have not been well-established or studied in depth. The enzyme's role in metabolism suggests potential influence on drug disposition, particularly for compounds metabolized through similar pathways as those it partakes in. Further research could illuminate relationships between SUGCT activity or mutations and responses to treatments, especially in the context of metabolic disorders where energy pathways are perturbed. However, specific drug interactions or genetic variants influencing drug response have yet to be definitively identified or characterized.
