## Gene Summary
SLC47A1, also known as solute carrier family 47 member 1, encodes the multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1). MATE1 functions as a proton-coupled electroneutral efflux transporter that primarily facilitates the excretion of cationic drugs and xenobiotics. It is expressed in various tissues, with prominent expression observed in the kidneys and liver. The transporter plays a crucial role in the renal and hepatic excretion processes, affecting the disposition of endogenous substrates and exogenous compounds.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SLC47A1 is involved in the pharmacokinetics of many clinically important drugs including metformin, cimetidine, and ganciclovir. This gene is also implicated in the progression of certain diseases when disrupted, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) and potentially type 2 diabetes, through its role in drug clearance and metabolic regulation. The efficiency of drug excretion facilitated by MATE1 can influence therapeutic outcomes and susceptibility to drug toxicity. Pathway involvement includes organic cation transport and drug response pathways, interacting with both endogenous metabolites and xenobiotics.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic research has shown that variations in SLC47A1 can significantly impact drug response and toxicity. Notably, specific polymorphisms in this gene are associated with altered activity of MATE1, which can affect the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of metformin, a first-line medication for type 2 diabetes. Enhanced or reduced transporter function due to these genetic variations can lead to differences in metformin absorption and clearance, influencing drug efficacy and the risk of adverse effects. Furthermore, pharmacogenetic interactions of SLC47A1 with other drugs such as cimetidine and ganciclovir underline the importance of considering genetic profiles in medication dosing and management to optimize therapeutic regimens and mitigate toxicities.
