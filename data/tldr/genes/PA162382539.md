## Gene Summary
CMPK1, or Cytidine Monophosphate (UMP-CMP) Kinase 1, is an enzyme encoded by the CMPK1 gene in humans. This protein is a nucleoside monophosphate kinase that plays a crucial role in nucleotide biosynthesis by catalyzing the phosphorylation of UMP and CMP to UDP and CDP, respectively. CMPK1 is vital for pyrimidine salvage pathways and de novo synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. Its expression is relatively widespread but noted to be higher in proliferative tissues, which require substantial nucleotide synthesis.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CMPK1 is involved in pathways crucial for cellular replication and metabolism, particularly the pyrimidine metabolism pathway. Abnormalities or mutations in CMPK1 function could potentially influence diseases linked to metabolic dysfunctions or proliferative disorders. While specific diseases directly associated with CMPK1 mutations are not widely documented, disturbances in pyrimidine metabolism generally can lead to various metabolic and possibly oncogenic processes due to unregulated DNA synthesis.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, the pharmacogenetic implications involving CMPK1 are not extensively documented in mainstream resources like PharmGKB or major genetic databases. CMPK1 is not prominently highlighted in the context of drug-gene interactions or as a direct target of pharmacological agents in clinical usage. However, given its role in nucleotide biosynthesis, CMPK1 might emerge as a potential target in therapies aimed at modulating nucleotide levels in diseases such as cancer or viral infections, where nucleotide analogs are often employed. Ongoing research might uncover more about its pharmacogenetics in future studies.
