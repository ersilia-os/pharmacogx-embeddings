## Gene Summary
STK11, also known as serine/threonine kinase 11, is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes the liver kinase B1 (LKB1) protein. It is involved in regulating cell growth, cell cycle, metabolism, and polarity, primarily through its role as a master kinase that activates multiple AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) family members. STK11 is crucial for cellular energy homeostasis and is broadly expressed in many tissue types, including liver, muscle, and pancreatic cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
STK11 is significantly implicated in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, a hereditary condition characterized by the growth of benign polyps in the gastrointestinal tract and a heightened risk of developing various cancers, including gastrointestinal, breast, and gynecologic cancers. Mutation in the STK11 gene leads to a loss of its kinase activity, which disrupts normal cellular function and contributes to the pathogenesis of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Moreover, STK11 is involved in several important cellular pathways, such as the AMPK signaling pathway, which plays a pivotal role in cellular energy homeostasis and has been linked to the regulation of cell growth and survival.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic implications of STK11 primarily concern its role in modulating responses to cancer treatments, given its tumor suppressor function. Evidence suggests that alterations in STK11 can influence the efficacy of certain chemotherapeutic agents. For instance, cancers with inactivated STK11 may exhibit altered sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors, due to STK11â€™s role in the LKB1-AMPK-mTOR pathway. This can affect the outcome and choice of therapeutic agents in treating cancers, particularly those associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and other related malignancies. Studies are ongoing to further elucidate the pharmacogenetics of STK11, especially in the context of predictive biomarkers for cancer therapeutics.
