## Gene Summary
ATP2B1, also known as the plasma membrane calcium-transporting ATPase 1, is a gene coding for a calcium pump located primarily in the plasma membrane. The protein encoded by ATP2B1 is involved in removing bivalent calcium ions from cells, which is crucial for various cellular functions including muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and hormone secretion. ATP2B1 is expressed in a variety of tissues but shows particularly high expression in the brain and heart.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ATP2B1 plays a key role in cellular processes that depend on calcium homeostasis. Dysregulation of calcium transport has implications for cardiovascular and neurological functions. Variations in ATP2B1 have been studied in relation to hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias, highlighting its importance in cardiovascular health. ATP2B1 influences several signaling pathways that involve calcium as a second messenger, thereby impacting processes like apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and transcription regulation.

## Pharmacogenetics
Genetic variants in ATP2B1 have been associated with differential responses to antihypertensive drugs. Particularly, certain polymorphisms have shown correlations with the efficacy of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), a class of drugs used primarily to treat hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias. Studies suggest that genetic variations in ATP2B1 can affect individual patient responses to these medications, which may influence dosing and selection of therapy in hypertension management. This highlights the potential of ATP2B1 as a pharmacogenetic marker to tailor antihypertensive treatment to individual genetic profiles.
