## Gene Summary
RPL13, or Ribosomal Protein L13, is a gene that encodes a protein component of the 60S subunit in the eukaryotic ribosome. This protein is involved in protein synthesis, playing a role in the assembly and functioning of the ribosome, which is critical for translating mRNA into polypeptides. RPL13 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, reflecting its essential function in cellular processes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
RPL13 does not have a direct association with specific drugs or diseases but is critical in the cellular machinery for protein synthesis, impacting various physiological and pathological states indirectly. Alterations in ribosomal protein genes, including RPL13, can contribute to disorders known as ribosomopathies, where ribosome dysfunction leads to clinical abnormalities such as developmental defects and increased cancer risk. RPL13 is involved in general cellular pathways, primarily focusing on protein synthesis.

## Pharmacogenetics
There are no direct pharmacogenetic associations involving RPL13 with specific drugs as its primary role is in the fundamental process of protein synthesis rather than in specific drug metabolisms or drug response pathways. Research into the pharmacogenetics of RPL13 is limited, as its ubiquitous expression and essential function make it less likely to be a variable determinant of drug response. The effects of RPL13 in pharmacogenetics may likely be indirect, influencing overall cellular health and protein production capacities.
