## Gene Summary
DPYD, or dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, is a crucial enzyme involved in the catabolism of thymine, uracil, and the fluoropyrimidine class of drugs. DPYD takes an essential role in the pathway that breaks down these compounds. This process is vital since it regulates the levels of these components available for DNA synthesis and prevents their toxic accumulation. The gene is widely expressed in tissues like the liver and gastrointestinal tract. The enzyme encoded by this gene plays a key role in the metabolism of pyrimidine, making its function critical for both normal cellular biochemistry and the detoxification of certain chemotherapeutic drugs.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The expression and functionality of DPYD are directly connected to its influence on several drug therapies, especially in the context of cancer treatment. Pertinent drugs metabolized by DPYD include 5-fluorouracil and capecitabine, which are widely used in treating various malignancies. Deficiencies in DPYD enzyme activity, whether due to genetic mutations or expression alterations, have been associated with severe drug toxicity. Such deficiencies can lead to life-threatening side effects when administering normal doses of fluoropyrimidines. Beyond its implications in pharmacology, variations in the DPYD gene have also been linked to dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency, which can contribute to a range of mild to severe symptoms, typically emerging in response to drug treatment.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the field of pharmacogenetics, DPYD is a critical gene due to its impact on the metabolism of cancer treatment drugs. Specific genetic variants of DPYD are known to alter enzyme activity, with significant consequences for patients undergoing treatment with fluoropyrimidine drugs. For example, the *DPYD* *c.1905+1G>A* (also referred to as DPYD*2A) variant profoundly decreases the breakdown of drugs like 5-fluorouracil, leading to increased drug levels in the body and severe toxicity. Such adverse reactions may include neutropenia, neurotoxicity, and even death. Consequently, genotyping for DPYD mutations is recommended before initiating treatment with 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. Adjustments in drug dosage or opting for alternative therapeutic regimens are often necessary for those found to carry risk alleles in the DPYD gene to avoid severe side effects and improve treatment efficacy.
