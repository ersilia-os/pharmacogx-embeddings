## Gene Summary
CCND1, or Cyclin D1, is a key regulatory protein involved in cell cycle progression, particularly in the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase. It functions primarily as a regulator of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), especially CDK4 and CDK6. CCND1 forms a complex with these CDKs to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein, which subsequently leads to the release of E2F transcription factors and the transcription of genes essential for DNA synthesis. Expression of CCND1 is tightly controlled and occurs in a variety of tissues, with particularly high levels noted in proliferating cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CCND1 is associated with several neoplastic diseases, including breast cancer, mantle cell lymphoma, and multiple myeloma, where it often appears overexpressed or amplified. The gene's involvement in cell cycle regulation makes it a pivotal player in oncogenesis. Dysregulation of CCND1 is frequently associated with poor prognosis and resistance to cancer therapies. The gene interacts with various cellular pathways, most notably those involving cell cycle progression and apoptosis, such as the RB and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. 

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, the focus has often been on the role of CCND1 polymorphisms and gene amplifications in predicting the response to cancer therapies. For instance, amplification of CCND1 can confer resistance to therapies that target the CDK4/6 pathway in breast cancer, indicating a potential need for alternative therapeutic strategies in affected individuals. Moreover, CCND1 expression levels and alterations can influence the efficacy of hormone therapies and chemotherapy in various cancers, suggesting its utility as a biomarker for tailoring treatment regimens. There is ongoing investigation into drugs that directly target CCND1-related pathways, including CDK4/6 inhibitors like palbociclib, which are used in the treatment of cancers with CCND1 involvement.
