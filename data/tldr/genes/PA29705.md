## Gene Summary
IGFBP3, or Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3, is a gene that encodes a member of the insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) family. IGFBP3 modulates the activity of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), which are crucial for cell growth, proliferation, and survival. IGFBP3 binds IGF-1 and IGF-2 with high affinity, thus regulating their availability and activity in various tissues. It plays a significant role in mediating the growth suppressive signal and has been implicated in cell growth control and apoptosis. Expression of IGFBP3 is often regulated by IGF-independent mechanisms, including various cytokines and tumor suppressor genes like p53.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
IGFBP3 is involved in several key pathways including the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway which influences growth, cell cycle, and cell survival. The protein also interacts with TGF-beta signaling, playing a role in immune function and inflammation. Clinically, IGFBP3 has been studied in relation to various cancers, such as breast, prostate, and lung cancers because of its role in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. Elevated levels of IGFBP3 have been observed in cardiovascular disease and in some cases linked with better outcomes, although data are complex and sometimes contradictory. It is also implicated in growth disorders and is a potential biomarker for growth hormone activity.

## Pharmacogenetics
From a pharmacogenetics perspective, IGFBP3 has associations with responses to certain cancer therapies. Specifically, studies have investigated IGFBP3 polymorphisms as they affect responses to drugs targeting the IGF system. For example, antineoplastic agents like figitumumab, a monoclonal antibody against IGF-1R, may have varying efficacy based on IGFBP3 levels and genetic variants. Variants in IGFBP3 have also been considered in the context of growth hormone treatments in children and adults, affecting drug efficacy and treatment outcomes. Furthermore, there is increasing interest in understanding how IGFBP3 modulators could serve as adjunct therapies in diseases such as cancer and diabetes, emphasizing its potential as a pharmacogenetic target.
