## Gene Summary
AMPD1 (Adenosine Monophosphate Deaminase 1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme adenosine monophosphate (AMP) deaminase 1, which is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle. This enzyme plays a critical role in the purine nucleotide cycle, assisting in the conversion of AMP to inosine monophosphate (IMP) and ammonia. AMPD1 is essential for maintaining the energy balance in muscle cells, especially during periods of high energy demand such as physical exercise. Variants and deficiency in the AMPD1 enzyme can lead to impaired energy conversion, potentially affecting muscle function.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
AMPD1 deficiency is linked to a condition known as myoadenylate deaminase deficiency, which can cause exercise intolerance, muscle pain, and cramps. Clinically, this is often characterized by a lack of rise in ammonia levels during exercise-induced ischemic forearm tests. The condition can range from asymptomatic to severe, highlighting a significant variability in phenotypic expression. The gene is part of critical metabolic pathways involving nucleotide metabolism and energy homeostasis in muscle tissues, which are essential for physical endurance and response to metabolic stress.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, the influence of AMPD1 variants, particularly the common C34T (rs17602729) mutation, has been studied in relation to response to medication in cardiovascular diseases. This variant has been implicated in modulating the efficacy of drugs like ribavirin, used in hepatitis C treatment. Patients with the AMPD1 deficiency may exhibit differential response rates potentially due to altered drug metabolism and effectiveness, influenced by disrupted adenosine pathways. However, more extensive clinical data and studies are required to firmly establish these associations and to guide adjustments in therapeutic strategies based on AMPD1 genotype.
