## Gene Summary
CNPY4, also known as Canopy FGF Signaling Regulator 4, is a gene mainly involved in modulating cellular functions such as signaling pathways. Though not as extensively characterized as some other genes, CNPY4 has a reported role in cellular processes, including Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling pathways. The expression patterns of CNPY4 may vary across different tissue types, but specific details on expression levels and distribution need further exploration.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CNPY4 is less studied in terms of direct associations with diseases or involvement in specific pharmacological phenotypes compared to other genes. However, its role in FGF signaling suggests indirect involvements in processes that could be relevant to cancer biology, development, and perhaps tissue repair mechanisms. The regulatory function within FGF pathways indicates potential implications in pathologies where this pathway is disrupted or dysregulated.

## Pharmacogenetics
There are currently limited direct pharmacogenetic insights regarding CNPY4, largely due to its relatively recent interest and description within genomics and molecular biology contexts. As of now, no specific drugs have been directly associated with genetic variants of CNPY4 in the context of treatment outcomes, adverse drug reactions or efficacy. However, future research could uncover relevant pharmacogenetic interactions, especially linked through its role in FGF signaling pathways, which are targets in various therapeutic scenarios, particularly in oncology and regenerative medicine.
