## Gene Summary
DMPK, or Dystrophia Myotonica-Protein Kinase, is a gene encoding a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a significant role in regulating muscle contractions, cardiovascular development, and insulin secretion. The DMPK gene is essential in muscle physiology; its function appears to be primarily focused on the modulation of ion channels, cellular differentiation, and intracellular signaling. DMPK is predominantly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles, pancreas, and brain. Dominantly inherited mutations in this gene are notably implicated in the etiology of myotonic dystrophy type 1, a form of muscular dystrophy.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The primary disease associated with DMPK mutations is Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1), characterized by progressive muscle loss and weakness, myotonia, cataracts, heart conduction defects, and endocrine changes. This disease manifests a wide spectrum of clinical outcomes, often linked to the size of the CTG triplet repeat expansion in the DMPK gene; larger expansions generally correlate with more severe symptoms. DMPK is involved in various signaling pathways, including those regulating RNA splicing and cellular transport processes. It interacts with several other proteins and ligands that govern these processes, placing it centrally in the pathophysiology of DM1.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of DMPK is closely tied to its role in myotonic dystrophy type 1. Current clinical approaches for managing DM1 symptoms revolve around symptomatic relief and do not target the underlying genetic defect. Due to various complications associated with the disease, understanding individual patient responses to drugs like mexiletine (used for myotonia), insulin (for diabetes), and beta-blockers or other antiarrhythmics (for cardiac symptoms) can be critical. The length of the CTG triplet repeat in the DMPK gene has been speculated to affect drug response, especially concerning cardiac conduction disturbances, although direct pharmacogenetic correlations are still under investigation. Enhanced pharmacogenetic profiling of DMPK may potentially improve therapeutic strategies by tailoring treatment based on genetic makeup and the predicted progression of the disease.
