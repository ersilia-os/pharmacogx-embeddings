## Gene Summary
ACOT7, standing for Acyl-CoA Thioesterase 7, is primarily involved in the hydrolysis of acyl-CoAs to the free fatty acid and coenzyme A (CoA), modulating intracellular levels of acyl-CoAs and free fatty acids. This gene is expressed in various tissues but has higher expression levels in metabolic tissues such as the liver and kidney. ACOT7 plays a critical role in lipid metabolism and energy production by regulating the balance of acyl-CoAs in the cell.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Although ACOT7 is not a direct target for a wide range of drugs, its expression and enzymatic activities are important in conditions associated with metabolic syndrome and fatty acid metabolism disorders. In mouse models, Acot7 deficiency has been associated with alterations in energy homeostasis and neurodegenerative conditions, indicating a broader physiological significance that could potentially link to human diseases. ACOT7 is part of the fatty acid metabolism pathway and influences several cellular processes including lipid biosynthesis and degradation.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of ACOT7 is not extensively studied, thus there is limited specific information on direct drug associations and genetic variants that influence drug response. However, as ACOT7 involves fatty acid metabolism, variations in this gene could hypothetically affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs involved in metabolic pathways, particularly those treating metabolic disorders. Further investigations into ACOT7 could provide insights into its potential impacts on drug efficacy and safety, especially in the context of metabolic and energy-modulating therapies.
