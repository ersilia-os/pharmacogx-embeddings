## Gene Summary
MICB (MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence B) is a gene located on chromosome 6 in humans and encodes a protein that is closely related to MHC class I molecules. However, it does not associate with beta-2 microglobulin nor bind peptides in the same manner as classical MHC class I molecules do. MICB plays a crucial role in immune surveillance by serving as a stress-induced ligand for NKG2D, a receptor present on natural killer (NK) cells, gamma/delta T cells, and some CD8+ alpha/beta T cells. Expression of MICB is upregulated in response to cellular stress, infection, or transformation, leading to activation of immune cells that can destroy the stressed cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
MICB is involved in several immune-related pathways and its upregulated expression is associated with various pathological conditions including cancer, infectious diseases, and autoimmune disorders. The interaction of MICB with its receptor NKG2D is pivotal for the immune system's ability to target and eliminate cells that are stressed or transformed, such as tumor cells or cells infected with viruses. Alterations in the expression or function of MICB can influence disease susceptibility, progression, and response to therapy. Importantly, its role in signaling to immune effector cells makes it a potential target for therapeutic intervention in cancer and other diseases where immune evasion is a key factor.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of MICB primarily relates to its role in modulating immune responses in cancer therapy. Drugs that alter immune checkpoints, such as NKG2D agonists, are influenced by the expression levels and function of MICB. Variants in the MICB gene can affect the binding affinity to NKG2D and consequently influence the effectiveness of these therapies. Genetic polymorphisms in MICB have been studied in the context of cancer treatment outcomes, where differences in response rates and survival times have been observed. Pharmacogenetic data on MICB can therefore play a crucial role in personalized medicine approaches, helping to tailor cancer immunotherapy treatments to individual patient's genetic profiles.
