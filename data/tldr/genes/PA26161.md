## Gene Summary
CCNK, also known as Cyclin K, is part of the cyclin family, which primarily functions in regulating cell cycle progression. The Cyclin K protein is involved in the regulation of transcription through its role as a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activating cyclin. It primarily forms complexes with CDK12 and CDK13, which are crucial for the transcriptional regulation of RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. CCNK is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, indicating a broad role in cellular functions. 

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CCNK is implicated in diverse biological pathways, mostly related to its role in transcriptional regulation and cell cycle progression. Alterations in its expression and function can influence cancer cell growth and survival, linking it to various oncological conditions. CCNK dysfunction is related to the pathogenesis of several cancers, including breast cancer and leukemia. The gene is considered a potential target for cancer therapy due to its involvement in critical regulatory mechanisms of cell cycle and gene expression.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, current research is evaluating the potential of targeting CCNK in cancer therapy, though specific drug interactions and genetic variations influencing drug response have not been fully elucidated. Due to its role in critical signaling pathways that control cell growth and proliferation, CCNK might be influential in the efficacy or toxicity of pharmacological inhibitors aimed at CDKs or transcription regulation mechanisms in cancer treatments. As research progresses, understanding specific CCNK genetic variants could guide the personalized therapeutic approaches and prediction of treatment outcomes in oncology.
