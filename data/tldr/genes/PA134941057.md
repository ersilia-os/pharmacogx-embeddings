## Gene Summary
CYP4Z1, short for Cytochrome P450 Family 4 Subfamily Z Member 1, is a gene belonging to the CYP450 superfamily of enzymes, which are primarily involved in the metabolism of various substances including drugs, fatty acids, and steroids. CYP4Z1 is a lesser-studied member, exhibiting a high level of expression primarily in mammary gland tissues. The enzyme encoded by CYP4Z1 is involved in the hydroxylation of fatty acids and other lipophilic substrates, which plays a role in cell signaling and metabolic regulation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CYP4Z1 does not have a well-established direct association with specific drugs or clinical phenotypes in the wider context of commonly used medications. However, it has been linked to certain diseases, notably breast cancer, due to its expression patterns and potential role in modifying the tumor microenvironment or influencing cancer cell proliferation through eicosanoid or hormone metabolism. The enzyme pathways concerning CYP4Z1 include various aspects of lipid metabolism which are integrated within larger networks of cellular signaling.

## Pharmacogenetics
Current knowledge on the pharmacogenetics of CYP4Z1 remains limited, primarily because its substrates and influence on drug metabolism are not thoroughly characterized. Unlike more commonly studied cytochromes like CYP2D6 or CYP3A4, CYP4Z1 does not yet have documented impacts on the metabolism of pharmaceuticals used in standard clinical settings. Ongoing research may reveal specific interactions or contributions to drug metabolism, resistance, or toxicity, particularly in the context of cancer therapy given its expression in breast tissue and potential link to tumor dynamics.
