## Gene Summary
**GRK4** (G protein-coupled receptor kinase 4) is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) family, primarily involved in the regulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This kinase plays a critical role in the phosphorylation and desensitization of GPCRs, a process that attenuates their signaling in response to ligand binding. GRK4 is highly expressed in certain tissues, including the testes and kidney, and has several isoforms resulting from alternative splicing which may have different regulatory roles. Its involvement in the modulation of dopamine receptors, particularly in the renal nephron, suggest a role in blood pressure regulation and sodium homeostasis.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
GRK4 has been implicated in several physiological and pathophysiological processes, primarily in hypertension and its related cardiovascular complications. The gene's variants have been studied for their roles in influencing blood pressure responses and in contributing to the pathogenesis of essential hypertension. GRK4 interacts with pathways involving dopamine receptors critical for renal function, affecting sodium reabsorption and thus impacting fluid balance and blood pressure. The regulatory network includes interactions with other signaling molecules and receptors that influence cardiovascular and renal systems.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, GRK4 exhibits notable associations particularly concerning antihypertensive drugs. Variants in GRK4, such as the GRK4 Î³ isoform polymorphisms, have been linked to differential responses to medications used in the treatment of hypertension. For instance, certain polymorphisms in GRK4 are associated with altered responses to diuretics and beta-blockers. Patients carrying specific GRK4 genetic variants may show resistance to conventional antihypertensive therapies, necessitating personalized medication strategies. This involvement highlights its potential as a biomarker for predicting drug efficacy and tailoring personalized treatment plans in hypertension management.
