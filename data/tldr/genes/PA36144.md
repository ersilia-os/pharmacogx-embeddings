## Gene Summary
ABI1, standing for Abl Interactor 1, plays a critical role in actin cytoskeleton remodeling and cell migration. It is part of the Abl-interactor family of adaptor proteins, which interact with various proteins involved in signaling pathways and cellular dynamics. ABI1 typically contributes to the linking of membrane receptor signaling to the actin cytoskeleton, impacting processes like cell adhesion, migration, and organization. It is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues, highlighting its fundamental regulatory roles across various cellular contexts.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ABI1 is implicated in several signaling pathways including those related to cell motility and cancer metastasis, often through its interaction with members of the Rho family GTPases and the ABL tyrosine kinase. Mutations and dysregulation of ABI1 have been associated with diseases such as leukemias and solid tumors. For example, in leukemia, ABI1 is part of the chromosomal aberrations like the t(10;11)(p11.2;q23) translocation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It also plays a role in the development of certain phenotypes involving aberrant cell movement and adhesion.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of ABI1 primarily involves its role in cancer, where its interaction pathways and mechanisms may influence the response to certain anticancer drugs. Although specific drugs targeting ABI1 directly are currently not well-defined, understanding its pathway interactions could lead to better therapeutic strategies, particularly in cancers where ABI1 is known to be mutated or dysregulated. Its involvement in cellular mechanisms crucial for cancer progression makes it a potential target for drugs aiming to modulate these pathways or for using its status to predict response to therapy in contexts like leukemia or other tumor types showing aberrations involving ABI1.
