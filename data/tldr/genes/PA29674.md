## Gene Summary
**IFNG**, short for Interferon Gamma, is a critical cytokine in the immune system, primarily produced by T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. IFNG is pivotal in mediating and regulating immunity and inflammation. It plays a key role in both innate and adaptive immune responses, and is crucial for defense against viral and intracellular bacterial infections as well as for tumor control. The cytokine operates by activating macrophages, enhancing antigen presentation, and promoting the Th1 response over the Th2 response. Its expression is tightly regulated, typically induced in response to specific immune stimuli, including specific interleukins and antigens.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
IFNG is deeply involved in various pathological conditions where the immune system plays a major role. It is linked to autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis due to its role in promoting inflammatory responses. In terms of infectious diseases, high levels of IFNG can contribute to the control and clearance of various viral and bacterial pathogens but may also lead to chronic inflammation and tissue damage. IFNG's antitumor effects make it critical in cancer immunotherapy, and it is often associated with the immuno-modulatory treatment approaches in oncology. It impacts several signaling pathways including the JAK-STAT pathway, serving as an essential mediator in the transcriptional activation of many immune-responsive genes.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of IFNG primarily revolves around its influence on treatment responses in various diseases due to its potent immunological effects. In the context of cancer treatment, recombinant IFNG has been employed in therapeutic formulations such as interferon gamma-1b (brand name Actimmune) used mainly for treating chronic granulomatous disease and severe malignant osteopetrosis. The variability in patient responses to IFNG-based therapies can be significant, influenced by genetic variations in the IFNG gene itself or in genes related to its pathways, which can affect both efficacy and adverse effects. Moreover, in autoimmune diseases, the link between genetic variants of IFNG and the response to treatments such as cytokine modulators or biologics is an area of active research, seeking to optimize therapy based on genetic backgrounds.
