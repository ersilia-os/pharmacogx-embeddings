## Gene Summary
HLA-DRA (Human Leukocyte Antigen-DR Alpha) is a gene located on chromosome 6, and it encodes the alpha chain of the HLA-DR protein, a component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule. This gene is responsible for presenting peptide antigens to the immune system, particularly important for the activation of T cells and the regulation of the immune response. HLA-DRA is expressed ubiquitously in antigen-presenting cells including B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages, highlighting its vital role in immune function.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
HLA-DRA is centrally involved in the immune response pathways and is inherently linked to several autoimmune diseases. Expression of this gene can influence susceptibility to conditions such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and type 1 diabetes. Phenotypically, variations in HLA-DRA and its associated pathways can affect antigen presentation and immune system adaptability. This gene plays a key role in immune regulation pathways, which could potentially interact with various immunomodulatory drugs.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of HLA-DRA chiefly involves its role in modulating responses to certain drugs in the context of linked autoimmune diseases. While directly specific drug associations for HLA-DRA in pharmacogenetics are not well established compared to other genes in the HLA family, exploratory research suggests its potential involvement in differential immune responses to treatments in autoimmune disorders. Further studies are required to substantiate precise drug-gene interactions and to leverage this knowledge for personalized medicine approaches in conditions associated with antigen presentation dysregulation.
