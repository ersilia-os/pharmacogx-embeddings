## Gene Summary
CBR3, or Carbonyl Reductase 3, is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. This enzyme is primarily involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics, drugs, and prostaglandins. CBR3 catalyzes the reduction of numerous biologically and pharmacologically active carbonyl compounds to their respective alcohols. It is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including liver and kidney. The gene encoding CBR3 is located on chromosome 21.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CBR3 is implicated in the metabolism of several important chemotherapeutic agents and is part of pathways dealing with drug metabolism. Alterations in its activity are observed in conditions such as cancer, where its expression can influence the efficacy and toxicity of certain chemotherapy drugs. Although not directly linked to specific diseases, variations in CBR3 function due to genetic variation can impact drug response phenotypes in individuals, affecting both therapeutic outcomes and the risk of adverse reactions.

## Pharmacogenetics
CBR3's pharmacogenetics is particularly significant in cancer treatment. The enzyme metabolizes compounds like doxorubicin and daunorubicin, which are used in cancer therapy. Genetic variants of CBR3, such as the common polymorphism CBR3 V244M, can substantially influence the enzyme's activity. For instance, the V244M variant alters the metabolism of doxorubicin, which can affect the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity profile of the drug in patients undergoing chemotherapy. Consideration of CBR3 genotypes is thus critical in personalizing treatment plans to optimize efficacy and minimize toxic side effects in cancer therapies involving these agents.
