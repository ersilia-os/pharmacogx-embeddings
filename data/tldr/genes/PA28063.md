## Gene Summary
FCGR2A, or Fc fragment of IgG receptor IIa, is crucial for the immune system's function by mediating the phagocytosis of microbes and the clearing of immune complexes. Located on chromosome 1, FCGR2A encodes a protein that acts as a cell surface receptor for the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G (IgG). The gene is expressed predominantly in cells involved in the immune response, such as neutrophils, macrophages, and natural killer cells. This receptor has a high affinity for IgG and facilitates signaling pathways that lead to cellular activation, endocytosis, and antigen presentation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
FCGR2A plays a pivotal role in various inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases including autoimmune disorders, infections, and allergic reactions. The protein's interaction with IgG-class antibodies can influence inflammation, opsonization, and the immune clearance mechanism. Genetic variations in FCGR2A have been implicated in susceptibility to diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and immune thrombocytopenic purpura. It contributes to the inflammatory response and immune complex clearance pathways, tying directly into the immune response to infectious agents and the modulation of autoimmunity.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of FCGR2A has been studied mainly in the context of biological treatments that involve monoclonal antibodies, where it can impact the efficacy and therapeutic outcomes. The gene's polymorphisms, notably the H131R variant (rs1801274), influence the affinity for IgG2 and might affect the clinical responses to treatments that use monoclonal IgG antibodies. It has been linked with variability in response to treatments such as rituximab, a monoclonal antibody used in oncology and autoimmune diseases, and trastuzumab, used in breast cancer therapy. Variation in FCGR2A also impacts response to antiplatelet therapy with drugs such as clopidogrel, used to prevent thrombotic cardiovascular events, with certain haplotypes showing a reduced response to the medication, thereby affecting clinical outcomes and treatment strategies. Therefore, understanding the FCGR2A genetic profile of an individual may improve personalized therapeutic approaches and prediction of drug response.
