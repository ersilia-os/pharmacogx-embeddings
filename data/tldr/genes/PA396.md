## Gene Summary
ABCC9, or ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 9, is a gene that encodes the protein SUR2 (sulfonylurea receptor 2). This protein is a regulatory subunit of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels and plays a crucial role in coupling metabolic states to electrical activity in various tissues. ABCC9 is predominantly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles, and its protein product is essential for the adaptive response of the heart to physical stress and ischemic conditions. It also influences the vascular tone by regulating potassium ion conductance in smooth muscle cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ABCC9 has implications in several critical pathways and health conditions. The gene is involved in the regulation of insulin release and has been associated with heart diseases such as dilated cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation. Mutations in ABCC9 can lead to Cant√∫ syndrome, a rare condition characterized by hypertrichosis, osteochondrodysplasia, and cardiomegaly. The KATP channels, of which ABCC9 is a part, are also crucial in protecting tissues like brain and heart during metabolic stress by regulating membrane potential and cellular excitability.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, ABCC9 holds significance due to its influence on the efficacy and safety of various drugs, especially those used in treating cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. The gene's product, as a component of KATP channels, is targeted by sulfonylureas such as glibenclamide and glimepiride, commonly used in the management of diabetes by promoting insulin release. Moreover, variations in ABCC9 are known to affect individual responses to these medications, potentially impacting their therapeutic outcomes. Thus, the genetic variations in ABCC9 can serve as a marker for predicting drug response and tailoring personalized treatment regimens in diabetes and cardiovascular therapy.
