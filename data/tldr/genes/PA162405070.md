## Gene Summary
SULT1C4, or Sulfotransferase Family 1C Member 4, is a gene involved in the metabolism of many endogenous compounds, xenobiotics, drugs, and hormones through sulfation. It falls under the sulfotransferase enzyme family, whose primary function is to transfer a sulfo group (SO3) from a donor molecule to an acceptor alcohol or phenol, rendering the product more water-soluble. SULT1C4 is part of the broader SULT1 enzyme subfamily, which shows substrate specificity across different compounds, suggesting diverse biological roles.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SULT1C4 is involved in the metabolism and detoxification pathways of numerous substances, significantly altering their solubility and excretion. The gene's activity impacts the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of various drugs, nutrients, and xenobiotics. Due to its role in the metabolism of dietary and environmental compounds, variations in the activity of SULT1C4 can influence susceptibility to certain toxicities and adverse drug reactions. However, explicit associations with specific diseases or phenotypes are not well-documented as compared to other more prominent sulfotransferases like SULT1A1 or SULT1E1.

## Pharmacogenetics
In terms of pharmacogenetics, the role of SULT1C4 is less directly established due to relatively less study in comparison to key pharmacogenetic actors such as SULT1A1 and SULT1E1. Even though it is known to participate in the metabolism of exogenous and endogenous substrates, concrete pharmacogenetic relationships identifying SULT1C4 interactions with specific drugs are not well-characterized in the literature. Much of the focus on sulfotransferases in pharmacogenetics has centered around other members of this family, potentially because SULT1C4 may have a more limited expression profile or a subtler impact on drug action and toxicity. Therefore, further research into its specific interactions and consequences is imperative to understand its complete pharmacogenetic profile.
