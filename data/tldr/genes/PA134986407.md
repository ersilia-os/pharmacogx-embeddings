## Gene Summary
CYP2R1 (Cytochrome P450 Family 2 Subfamily R Member 1) is primarily known for its role in the hydroxylation of vitamin D to form 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the major circulating form of vitamin D, which is critical for subsequent activation to the hormonally active form, calcitriol. Expressed predominantly in the liver, CYP2R1 is a part of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, enzymes that are often involved in the metabolism of drugs and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids, and other lipids.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CYP2R1 is intimately linked to vitamin D metabolism, with potential implications in diseases associated with vitamin D deficiency, such as rickets, osteoporosis, and certain immune diseases. Mutations in this gene can lead to vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1B, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the early onset of rickets, muscle weakness, and growth retardation. Despite its primary role in vitamin D metabolism, CYP2R1 does not have extensive associations with a wide range of drugs akin to other CYP enzymes. Its influence remains largely confined to its pivotal enzymatic role within the vitamin D pathway, including the conversion of vitamin D to its more active form in the liver.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic associations of CYP2R1 primarily concern its impact on vitamin D levels in the body, which in turn can influence the efficacy and safety of vitamin D supplementation and metabolism. Genetic variants can affect individual responses to vitamin D intake and thus susceptibility to diseases related to vitamin D deficiency. Differential activity of CYP2R1, determined by specific gene variants, could potentially modify vitamin D processing and thereby influence conditions like bone health and immune function. Given its role in this pathway, pharmacogenetic testing might guide personalized vitamin D supplementation strategies. However, direct associations with traditional pharmacological agents are relatively limited compared to other cytochrome P450 enzymes.
