## Gene Summary
SLCO2B1, or Solute Carrier Organic Anion Transporter Family Member 2B1, is a gene that encodes an organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP2B1). This protein is part of a larger group of membrane transport proteins that facilitate the transport of a wide variety of endogenous and exogenous organic compounds, including bile acids, hormones, and drugs across the cell membrane. SLCO2B1 is ubiquitously expressed in several tissues with significant expression in the liver and the intestine, suggesting its role in hepatic and intestinal drug metabolism and disposition.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SLCO2B1 is implicated in the transport of several drugs and has influences on pharmacokinetics and dynamics. Its substrates include statins, steroid hormones, and some anticancer drugs, reflecting its importance in therapeutic drug monitoring and influencing treatment outcomes in various diseases. Dysregulation or genetic variations within SLCO2B1 have been linked to altered drug efficacy and adverse drug reactions. Furthermore, pathways involving SLCO2B1 contribute to the metabolism and excretion of endogenous and xenobiotic substances, which can influence numerous physiological and pathological conditions.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of SLCO2B1 is particularly significant in the context of statin therapy. Genetic variations in SLCO2B1 can affect the plasma concentration and therapeutic efficacy of statins, widely used for cholesterol management and cardiovascular risk reduction. For example, specific SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in SLCO2B1 have been associated with altered statin disposition, potentially leading to variations in drug effectiveness and risks of side effects such as myopathy. Genetic testing for SLCO2B1 variants can be essential in personalizing statin therapy to optimize outcomes and minimize adverse effects. Additionally, SLCO2B1 interactions with drugs such as montelukast and repaglinide underscore its broader role in pharmacogenetics across different therapeutic categories.
