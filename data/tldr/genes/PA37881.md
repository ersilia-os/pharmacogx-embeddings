## Gene Summary
SLC13A3, officially known as Solute Carrier Family 13 Member 3, is a gene that codes for a sodium-dependent transporter specifically involved in the transport of dicarboxylates such as succinate and citrate. This protein is an important component in the renal and hepatic handling of citrate and other Krebs cycle intermediates, which are crucial for energy metabolism and also play roles in regulating acid-base balance in tissues. SLC13A3 is predominantly expressed in the kidney and liver.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SLC13A3 has implications for various metabolic and renal diseases. Abnormal function or expression of this transporter can impact citrate levels, thus potentially influencing systemic conditions like metabolic acidosis or disorders involving altered citrate metabolism such as renal tubular acidosis. Pathways associated with SLC13A3 include citrate transport and metabolism, suggesting its involvement in broader metabolic processes and its importance in renal citrate handling which is critical for preventing kidney stone formation.

## Pharmacogenetics
Research into the pharmacogenetics of SLC13A3 has been relatively limited, but it is understood that variations in this gene might influence the effectiveness and toxicity of drugs that are dependent on renal excretion, potentially through mechanisms involving alterations in citrate transport. Further studies are necessary to establish more concrete pharmacogenetic associations and their clinical implications for drug therapy in conditions like renal disorders or metabolic disturbances where citrate handling is disrupted.
