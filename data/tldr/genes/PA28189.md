## Gene Summary
FMO5, or flavin-containing monooxygenase 5, is part of the FMO gene family, which is involved in the oxidation of drugs and xenobiotics using NADPH and oxygen. FMO5, distinct from other FMOs, has a broader substrate specificity. It is highly expressed in the liver and small intestine, although the expression can vary. The gene plays a role in metabolic processes involving sulfur and nitrogen compounds, but its full range of substrates and physiological roles are less defined compared to other members of the FMO family.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
FMO5 does not have the typical drug-metabolizing activity seen in other family members such as FMO3 but is implicated in metabolic pathways that could influence drug metabolism indirectly. The gene has been studied less extensively in the context of specific diseases; however, variations in FMO5 have been linked to alterations in metabolic phenotypes, which might influence disease states linked to metabolism. Its involvement in different metabolic pathways suggests a background role in handling various exogenous and endogenous compounds.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the realm of pharmacogenetics, FMO5 has not been as prominently featured as other enzymes like CYP450s or even other FMOs. However, it is hypothesized that variations in the FMO5 gene could alter the metabolism of drugs and substances that are not the typical substrates of other FMOs, potentially affecting drug efficacy and safety. Further research is needed to establish clear pharmacogenetic associations. As of now, there is no specific list of drugs directly linked in a pharmacogenetic context to FMO5, underscoring the need for more detailed investigations into how this gene affects drug response and toxicity in the human population.
