## Gene Summary
GC, also known as GC Vitamin D Binding Protein (VDBP), is a multifunctional protein involved in the transport of vitamin D metabolites. It is primarily known for binding to and transporting vitamin D and its hydroxylated metabolites (like calcidiol and calcitriol) in the bloodstream. GC is synthesized predominantly in the liver and plays a critical role in regulating the bioavailability of vitamin D, which is crucial for calcium homeostasis and bone health. Additionally, GC is involved in fatty acid transport and has roles in the immune response, particularly in activating macrophages.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The GC gene is instrumental in vitamin D metabolism, which impacts various physiological functions and disease outcomes. Disorders associated with GC generally involve issues with bone health, such as rickets and osteoporosis, linked to impaired vitamin D metabolism. The gene may also play a role in autoimmune conditions and susceptibility to infections given its involvement in the immune system. In terms of pathways, GC is central to the vitamin D metabolism pathway, influencing the levels and activity of vitamin D3 by affecting its transport and availability to cells and tissues.

## Pharmacogenetics
GC variants are known to influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of vitamin D supplements and possibly other drugs that interact with vitamin D pathways. Certain polymorphisms in the GC gene can alter the binding efficiency and the circulating levels of vitamin D, thereby affecting an individualâ€™s response to vitamin D supplementation. For instance, specific GC genotypes are associated with differences in bone density response to vitamin D, suggesting personalized supplementation strategies might be more effective. Additionally, due to its role in immune modulation, variations in the GC gene might impact the effectiveness of immunomodulatory drugs, though direct drug-gene interaction studies are limited. Understanding these genetic variations helps in tailoring treatments that depend on vitamin D metabolism for various conditions like osteoporosis, certain cancers, and immune-related diseases.
