## Gene Summary
SLC47A2, or Solute Carrier Family 47 Member 2, is a gene that encodes MATE2 (Multidrug And Toxin Extrusion 2), which is a transporter protein primarily expressed in the human kidney. MATE2 functions as an efflux transporter, mainly involved in the renal secretion and excretion of xenobiotics and endogenous organic cations. It operates by utilizing the electrochemical gradient of protons across membranes to facilitate the movement of substrates from cells into urine, thereby playing a crucial role in detoxifying various compounds and in maintaining internal homeostasis.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SLC47A2 is integral in influencing the pharmacokinetics of various drugs, especially those cleared renally. Disorders associated with mutations or dysregulation of SLC47A2 function can lead to altered drug handling and toxicities, although specific diseases linked to gene dysfunction are not well-documented. The gene is involved in pathways that manage the body's exposure to toxic substances, thereby affecting drug disposition and response. Understanding the expression and function of MATE2 can provide insights into renal drug handling, potential toxicities, and inter-individual variations in drug response.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, SLC47A2 is important due to its role in mediating the renal excretion of many drugs including metformin, which is a widely prescribed medication for type 2 diabetes. Variations or polymorphisms in SLC47A2 can affect the transport efficiency and may lead to variations in metformin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. For example, certain SLC47A2 variants have been shown to alter the transport activity of MATE2, impacting metformin clearance and, consequently, its efficacy and risk of adverse effects such as lactic acidosis. Drugs whose plasma levels and toxicity are potentially influenced by MATE2 transporter activity include cimetidine and procainamide. The study of SLC47A2 in the context of pharmacogenetics is ongoing, with growing interest in understanding how genetic differences in this transporter affect the renal elimination of drugs and the implications for precision medicine.
