## Gene Summary
IFNGR1, short for Interferon Gamma Receptor 1, is a critical component of the cellular response to interferon gamma (IFN-γ), a cytokine important for innate and adaptive immunity against viral and intracellular bacterial infections and for tumor control. The encoded protein of IFNGR1 is part of a heterodimeric receptor complex, interacting with IFNGR2 to initiate a signaling pathway activating various transcription factors that regulate immune response, cell survival, and growth inhibition. This receptor is expressed in most immune cells, and its expression can be upregulated by the very cytokine (IFN-γ) it binds, suggesting a feedback mechanism in controlling immune response.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations and deficiencies in IFNGR1 have been linked to Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD), a rare immunodeficiency characterized by increased susceptibility to mycobacterial infections, including both typical and atypical mycobacterial species. The normal function of IFNGR1 is critical for the activation of macrophages and promotion of Th1 immune responses, essential for controlling mycobacterial infections. Pathway involvement includes the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, which is activated upon IFN-γ binding and leads to transcriptional activation of genes involved in immune response.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic insights into IFNGR1 are primarily centered around its role in modulating the efficacy and toxicity of treatment in diseases such as chronic granulomatous disease and various types of cancers where interferon-gamma is used therapeutically. Although specific drug interactions have not been extensively documented in the context of IFNGR1 variations, understanding these interactions could be crucial for optimizing treatments involving cytokine therapy, especially in patients with inherited IFNGR1 deficiencies or mutations. The clinical response to interferon-gamma treatment can vary significantly, potentially influenced by genetic variants in the IFNGR1 gene, impacting the therapeutic outcomes and adverse effects management.
