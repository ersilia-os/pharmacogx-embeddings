## Gene Summary
SLC22A11 (Solute Carrier Family 22 Member 11) is a gene that encodes a protein known as the organic anion transporter 4 (OAT4). This protein belongs to the organic anion transporters (OATs) subgroup within the larger family of solute carriers. It is primarily expressed in the kidney, particularly in the proximal tubule cells, where it functions in the renal handling of endogenous and exogenous organic anions. OAT4 facilitates the exchange of intracellular dicarboxylates for extracellular organic anions, playing a crucial role in the secretion and reabsorption processes of various substances in the kidney.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SLC22A11 is involved in the transport of several drugs, including popular diuretics, antivirals, and antibiotics. It plays a significant role in renal drug excretion and can affect the pharmacokinetic behavior of drugs. The alteration in function of SLC22A11 can lead to variations in drug response and toxicity. Diseases associated with SLC22A11 mainly concern renal function impairments and disorders such as hypertension and renal tubular acidosis. Pathways involving SLC22A11 include drug metabolism and the transport of metabolic products and xenobiotics, integral to understanding the pharmacokinetics of many therapeutic agents.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, SLC22A11 is of notable interest due to its influence on the renal clearance of medications. Variants in this gene can affect the transporter activity, which is critical for drugs whose elimination is heavily dependent on renal excretion. Specific genetic variations in SLC22A11 have been linked to altered responses to certain diuretics such as furosemide and thiazides, which are used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure. Research into the pharmacogenetics of SLC22A11 aims to better predict individual responses to these drugs and adjust dosages more accurately to improve therapeutic outcomes and reduce adverse effects. Further studies on the gene-disease associations and gene-drug interactions continue to enhance personalized medicine efforts.
