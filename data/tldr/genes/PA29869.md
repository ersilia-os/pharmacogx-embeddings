## Gene Summary
IDO1, or indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1, is a widely expressed enzyme mainly involved in tryptophan catabolism through the kynurenine pathway. It plays a significant role in immunoregulation by mediating immune tolerance and is expressed in various tissues but predominantly seen in the placenta, lung, liver, and intestine. IDO1 activity leads to depletion of tryptophan, which can suppress T cell function and modulate immune response, thus facilitating tumor cells to evade immune surveillance in pathological conditions.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
IDO1 is linked to the pathophysiology of several diseases, primarily due to its role in immune system regulation. It is implicated in cancer, chronic infections, depression, and autoimmune disorders. In cancer, for example, high IDO1 activity correlates with tumor growth and poor prognosis, as the enzyme helps in creating an immune suppressive tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, the kynurenine pathway influenced by IDO1 is associated with neurodegenerative diseases due to neurotoxic metabolites production. The enzyme's activity in tryptophan metabolism also ties it to behavioral disorders and depression.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, IDO1's relevance emerges in the context of cancer therapy, where IDO1 inhibitors are being evaluated for their potential to enhance anti-tumor immune responses by thwarting the enzyme's immunosuppressive effects. Drugs such as indoximod and epacadostat specifically target IDO1 to mitigate its activity and improve the efficacy of other cancer therapeutics like chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. This efficacy can differ widely depending on IDO1 gene variations among individuals, which may affect both the metabolism of tryptophan and the therapeutic response to IDO1 inhibitors. Understanding these genetic variations can aid in personalizing cancer treatment regimens, potentially enhancing therapeutic outcomes and minimizing side effects for specific patient groups.
