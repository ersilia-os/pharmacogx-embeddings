## Gene Summary
SLC39A8, also known as solute carrier family 39 member 8, is an essential gene encoding a zinc transporter protein using the ZIP (Zrt- and Irt-like proteins) mechanism. This protein is involved in the cellular uptake of zinc and manganese, which are crucial for numerous biological functions, including enzyme activity regulation and protein synthesis. SLC39A8 is expressed in various tissues but is particularly notable in the intestine, brain, and kidney, reflecting its role in metal ion transport across cell membranes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations and variability in the expression of SLC39A8 are implicated in several human diseases. It is associated with disorders such as congenital disorder of glycosylation type IIc (CDG IIC), also known as Leigh-like syndrome with transient leukoencephalopathy, and multiple sclerosis. Phenotypically, alterations in SLC39A8 function can lead to issues with cognitive function, skeletal abnormalities, and immune system dysfunction due to disrupted metal homeostasis. Pathways involving SLC39A8 primarily focus on trace metal ion homeostasis, specifically concerning zinc and manganese, which play critical roles in immune function and antioxidant defense mechanisms.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of SLC39A8 involves its role in modulating the body's response to certain drugs through its effect on zinc and manganese transport. For instance, alterations in SLC39A8 function could influence the efficacy and toxicity of drugs that rely on or affect trace metal homeostasis. However, specific drug associations and recommendations based on SLC39A8 genetic variants are still under investigation in the field of pharmacogenetics. As more data become available, potential pharmacogenetic applications could include modifying doses of drugs that interact with zinc and manganese pathways or predicting adverse drug reactions in individuals with altered SLC39A8 function.
