## Gene Summary
ABCG2, known as ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily G Member 2, is a transporter protein that plays a crucial role in multidrug resistance in cancer treatment. It is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily, which transport various molecules across extra- and intracellular membranes. ABCG2 is expressed in various tissues, prominently in the placenta, intestine, and brain, and it functions primarily as an efflux pump, transferring substrates out of cells. This activity helps in the regulation of xenobiotic transport in gut, as well as the blood-brain and blood-testis barriers.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ABCG2 is implicated in influencing the pharmacokinetics of a wide array of drugs due to its role in effluxing drugs out of cells. Diseases associated with ABCG2 include gout, as mutations in this gene affect urate excretion, leading to hyperuricemia. In cancer, ABCG2 contributes to chemotherapy resistance by pumping anticancer drugs out of cells, making them less effective. The gene is involved in various signaling pathways, including those related to drug transport and metabolism, highlighting its importance in modulating drug bioavailability and disposition.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, ABCG2 has been studied for its significant impact on the absorption, distribution, and elimination of many drugs. Notably, variants of ABCG2, particularly the Q141K variant, have been associated with altered drug response and adverse drug reactions. Drugs affected include certain chemotherapy agents like irinotecan and topotecan, tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as vandetanib, and antiretroviral drugs. For example, the Q141K variant has been linked to increased plasma levels of rosuvastatin, necessitating dose adjustments. Understanding ABCG2 variants helps in personalizing treatment regimens to enhance efficacy and reduce toxicity, especially in cancer chemotherapy.
