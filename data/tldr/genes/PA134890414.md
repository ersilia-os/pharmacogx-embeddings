## Gene Summary
P3H3, or Prolyl 3-Hydroxylase 3, is associated primarily with the enzymatic post-translational modification of collagen. It belongs to a specific subgroup of prolyl 3-hydroxylases that catalyze the 3-hydroxylation of proline residues in -Xaa-Pro-Gly- sequences in collagens, particularly modifying certain proline residues following glycine in collagen strands. This hydroxylation is crucial for proper collagen triple-helix formation and stability. The expression of P3H3 is detected mainly in heart, muscle, and bone, indicating its role in the structural integrity of these tissues.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
P3H3 does not have a direct association with particular drugs but is fundamental in connective tissue disorders due to its key role in collagen synthesis and modification. Mutations in or dysregulation of this gene or its activity are suspected to contribute to various phenotypes involving connective tissue structures, potentially impacting conditions such as osteogenesis imperfecta, though direct links are still under exploration. P3H3 is involved in the collagen biosynthesis and modifying pathways, enhancing understanding of diseases related to extracellular matrix disorders.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetics research related to P3H3 is relatively limited, as direct drug interactions or modifications based on the action of P3H3 have not been extensively documented. The geneâ€™s role in modifying collagens suggests that its pharmacogenetic implications might be more relevant in the context of therapies aimed at treating structural connective tissue disorders or regulating collagen synthesis and stability. Future research may uncover more about how variations in P3H3 influence responses to treatments in these areas.
