## Gene Summary
CYP27B1 (Cytochrome P450 Family 27 Subfamily B Member 1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-hydroxylase. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the metabolic pathway of vitamin D, converting 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (calcidiol) into 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol), the active form of vitamin D. This conversion is a key step in maintaining calcium and phosphate homeostasis, thereby influencing bone formation and immune response. CYP27B1 is predominantly expressed in the kidney, but also in other tissues including the skin, macrophages, and cells of the immune system.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The activity of CYP27B1 impacts various physiological processes mainly via its role in vitamin D metabolism. Dysfunction in this gene is directly linked to diseases such as rickets, osteomalacia, and potentially to autoimmune conditions due to its role in immune regulation. The enzyme is a part of the vitamin D synthesis and metabolism pathway, which has broader implications for calcium homeostasis and bone health. Physiological variations in CYP27B1 can affect the conversion efficiency of calcidiol to calcitriol, influencing vitamin D levels in the body and related health outcomes.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic aspects of CYP27B1 are particularly relevant in the context of vitamin D deficiency treatments and the management of conditions like rickets or familial hypophosphatemia. Variants in this gene can modulate the response to vitamin D supplements or analogs such as calcitriol. For instance, certain mutations in CYP27B1 result in vitamin D-resistant rickets, necessitating tailored therapeutic approaches that might include higher doses of vitamin D or direct administration of calcitriol. Understanding individual genetic variations in CYP27B1 can guide more effective dosing and treatment strategies, potentially improving clinical outcomes in diseases influenced by vitamin D metabolism.
