## Gene Summary
PRKAB2, the official symbol for the "Protein Kinase AMP-Activated Non-Catalytic Subunit Beta 2", is a regulatory subunit of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK is a crucial enzyme complex involved in energy homeostasis and regulates various cellular processes by sensing the ATP/AMP ratio in cells. Functionally, PRKAB2 interacts with the catalytic alpha subunits and the gamma subunits of AMPK, influencing the kinase activity and cellular localization. PRKAB2 is widely expressed in various tissues including the liver, skeletal muscle, and heart, which are central to metabolic regulation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
PRKAB2 is integral to metabolic pathways that respond to cellular energy levels and stress, playing a key role in pathways like fatty acid oxidation, carbohydrate metabolism, and the regulation of insulin. Alterations in these pathways are implicated in metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus and obesity. The gene also participates in signaling pathways that can impact the development of cardiovascular diseases. While direct drug interactions are less commonly articulated compared to other pharmacogenetic genes, its influence on metabolic pathways makes it a potential target for indirect drug effects and therapeutic strategies in metabolic disorders.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of PRKAB2 are primarily related to its role in metabolic pathways that could affect the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of drugs targeted at metabolic disorders, such as antidiabetics. Specific pharmacogenetic interactions or associations with particular drugs are not commonly detailed in literature for PRKAB2 as extensively as for some other genes. However, any variation in the PRKAB2 gene could theoretically influence the effectiveness or toxicity of drugs that modulate AMPK pathways, which are significant in the context of drugs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (like metformin) and possibly influencing lipid-lowering agents. Research into how variations in PRKAB2 impact drug response and metabolic outcomes remains an area ripe for further exploration.
