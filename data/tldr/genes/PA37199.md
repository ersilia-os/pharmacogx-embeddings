## Gene Summary
The gene UMOD encodes uromodulin, which is the most abundant protein in the urine under normal physiological conditions. Uromodulin, also known as Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein, is produced in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop in the kidney. It plays a critical role in kidney function and salt and water homeostasis. The protein is involved in forming matrixes that can lead to gel formations in the urine and has a role in modulating immune responses, influencing ion transport, and preventing urinary tract infections.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in UMOD have been linked to a spectrum of kidney disorders, notably autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD-UMOD), which leads to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal failure. Uromodulin levels have been used as a biomarker for kidney function in various clinical contexts. Additionally, variations in UMOD are associated with hypertension and chronic kidney disease in diabetes. The gene is implicated in pathways controlling kidney development, ion transport, and protection against urinary tract infections.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics aspects of UMOD primarily relate to its impact on renal disease progression and treatment responses in patients with kidney disorders. There is ongoing research into how variants of the UMOD gene may affect the treatment outcomes for patients using diuretics and other medications that alter renal sodium handling and blood pressure management. Understanding the interactions between UMOD gene variants and these drugs could lead to more personalized and effective treatment strategies for managing chronic kidney diseases and associated conditions.
