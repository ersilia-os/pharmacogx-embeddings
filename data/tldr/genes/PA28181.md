## Gene Summary
FLT3, or Fms related receptor tyrosine kinase 3, is a member of the class III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family, which includes KIT, FMS, and PDGFR. It plays a crucial role in the regulation of hematopoiesis, particularly in the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of hematopoietic progenitor cells. FLT3 is primarily expressed in human bone marrow and spleen, as well as in hematopoietic stem cells. It acts by binding to its ligand (FLT3LG or FLT3 ligand), resulting in dimerization and activation through autophosphorylation, leading to signal transduction pathways that influence cell growth and differentiation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
FLT3 is notably implicated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) where internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations and other activating mutations in this gene are common and are associated with a poor prognosis in patients. These mutations lead to constitutive activation of the FLT3 kinase, driving the uncontrolled proliferation of leukemic cells. FLT3 is also involved in the pathophysiology of other hematologic malignancies. The FLT3 signaling pathway includes activation of PI3K/AKT, RAS/MAPK, and STAT5, which are critical for cell survival and proliferation. Due to its role in these signaling pathways and diseases, FLT3 is a significant target for therapeutic intervention.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of FLT3 is particularly relevant in the context of targeted cancer therapy. Drugs such as midostaurin, quizartinib, and gilteritinib specifically target FLT3 mutations. Midostaurin, approved by the FDA, is used for treating AML with FLT3 mutations in combination with standard chemotherapy and has shown to significantly improve survival rates. Quizartinib and gilteritinib are other FLT3 inhibitors that have shown efficacy in clinical trials for treating AML patients with FLT3 mutations, particularly those resistant to other treatments. The effectiveness of these drugs can be significantly influenced by the specific type and location of FLT3 mutations in individual patients, underscoring the importance of personalized medicine in the treatment of AML. The variability in drug response based on FLT3 mutational status highlights the need for genetic testing prior to the initiation of therapy.
