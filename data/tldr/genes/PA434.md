## Gene Summary
TNFSF13B, also known as BAFF (B-cell Activating Factor), is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family. This gene encodes a cytokine that is important for B cell development, differentiation, and immunoglobulin synthesis. TNFSF13B is primarily expressed by monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. It promotes the survival and proliferation of B cells and is crucial in the enhancement of the immune response by aiding in the maturation of B cells into plasma cells and memory cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
TNFSF13B is linked to the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases, including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), and Sj√∂gren's syndrome, due to its critical role in B cell activation and survival pathways. Furthermore, elevated levels of BAFF have been associated with disease activity in these conditions. In terms of pathways, BAFF binds to three receptors: BAFF-R, BCMA, and TACI, all of which are pivotal in the regulation of B cell function and survival.

## Pharmacogenetics
The role of TNFSF13B in pharmacogenetics primarily relates to its implications in autoimmune disorders. The drug belimumab, a human monoclonal antibody, specifically targets and inhibits BAFF, thus reducing B cell survival and activity. This pharmacological intervention has been critical for treating diseases such as SLE, where BAFF's role in promoting autoantibody production is a key factor in disease pathology. Studies have indicated that genetic variations in TNFSF13B may affect individual responses to belimumab, although more detailed research is necessary to fully understand these pharmacogenetic associations.
