## Gene Summary
RFPL4B (Ret Finger Protein Like 4B) is a gene involved in the cellular processes, although specific details about its function are still emerging. It belongs to a larger family of Ret finger proteins which are known to be involved in various cellular functions, including neural development and apoptosis. There isn't extensive documentation on the expression patterns of RFPL4B, but members of this protein family are generally expressed in a variety of tissues, suggesting a potentially wide range of biological functions.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Currently, there is limited detailed information on specific drugs, diseases directly linked to RFPL4B, or characteristic phenotypes resulting from its alteration. Also, the pathways involving RFPL4B have not been well-defined, and further research is needed to clarify its role in cellular and physiological processes. This gene, however, could potentially have implications in neurological developments or disorders given the known roles of similar protein family members.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of RFPL4B are not yet established. No direct associations between variations in RFPL4B and differential drug responses or adverse drug reactions have been reported in the current literature. As research progresses, more insights into how RFPL4B might influence drug metabolism or efficacy, particularly in the context of neurological conditions, may emerge. For now, it remains an area ripe for further exploration in pharmacogenomics studies.
