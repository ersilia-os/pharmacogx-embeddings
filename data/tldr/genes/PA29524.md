## Gene Summary
HSP90AB1 stands for Heat Shock Protein 90 Alpha Family Class B Member 1, which belongs to the HSP90 protein family highly conserved among species. This gene encodes a molecular chaperone that has a crucial role in aiding the proper folding of many proteins, including kinases and hormone receptors. It is predominantly found in the cytosol and is actively involved during cellular stress responses, playing a key role in protein homeostasis. HSP90AB1 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissuesâ€”a reflection of its essential functions in cellular machinery.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
HSP90AB1 is integral in multiple cellular pathways, most notably the heat shock response pathway, and is involved in the folding and stabilization of proteins that are key in signaling, growth, and survival. Abnormal function or expression of this gene is implicated in a range of diseases, primarily cancer, where it supports the function and stability of oncogenic proteins. Its role in cancer cell survival makes it a target for antitumor drugs. Phenotypes associated with the aberrant function of HSP90AB1 typically manifest as diseases characterized by altered cellular growth and protein misfolding.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, HSP90AB1 is significant due to its role as a molecular target for anticancer therapy. Compounds known as HSP90 inhibitors, such as ganetespib, luminespib, and onalespib, interact specifically with this chaperone to disrupt its function, leading to the degradation of its client proteins which are often oncogenic. The effectiveness and toxicity of these drugs can differ among individuals based on variations in the HSP90AB1 gene. Consequently, understanding genetic differences in this gene can help tailor cancer therapies and anticipate responses or resistance to HSP90 inhibitors.
