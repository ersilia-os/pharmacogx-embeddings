## Gene Summary
NUDT15, officially known as Nudix Hydrolase 15, is a gene that encodes for an enzyme involved in the metabolism of nucleoside diphosphates. The enzyme hydrolyzes 8-oxo-dGTP in the nucleus, thereby preventing misincorporation of 8-oxoGuanine into DNA and consequential DNA damage. Predominantly located in the mitochondria, NUDT15 plays a crucial role in chemical detoxification and intracellular signaling regulation by managing oxidative DNA damage and maintaining genome stability. Expression of NUDT15 varies across tissue types, with significant implications in both normal physiology and disease pathogenesis.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NUDT15 is critical in pharmacology and genetics, linked to conditions such as thiopurine toxicity which is important in treatment contexts for certain cancers and autoimmune diseases. Thiopurines, including drugs like mercaptopurine, are commonly used as chemotherapy agents. Genetic variations in NUDT15 are strongly associated with variations in drug responses, influencing both efficacy and adverse reactions. Additionally, the gene's pathway involvement includes metabolism of nucleotides and response to oxidative stress, playing a vital role in cellular responses to external stressors and in drug metabolism processes, particularly in the context of chemotherapeutic treatments.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic research has revealed that variations in NUDT15 significantly affect the metabolism of thiopurine drugs, which are crucial in the treatment of leukemias, inflammatory bowel disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Specific polymorphisms in NUDT15, such as rs116855232, lead to an enzyme with reduced activity, which increases the risk of severe thiopurine toxicity. Patients with certain NUDT15 variants may require dose adjustments of thiopurine drugs to avoid adverse effects like bone marrow suppression. Thus, genotyping NUDT15 has become increasingly important before initiating thiopurine treatment to determine the appropriate drug dosage, enhancing both the safety and effectiveness of the therapy.
