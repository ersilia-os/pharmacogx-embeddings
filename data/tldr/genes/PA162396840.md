## Gene Summary
NALCN (Sodium Leak Channel, Non-Selective) is a protein-coding gene that encodes a member of the sodium leak channel family. NALCN forms a non-selective, voltage-insensitive, cation channel contributing to the background sodium ion leakage current in neurons and other cells. It is essential for maintaining the resting membrane potential and for neuronal excitability. Expression of NALCN is widespread but most prominent in the nervous system, playing crucial roles in regulating neuronal firing and pacemaker activities.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NALCN is implicated in several pathological conditions, notably congenital contractures, hypotonia, and severe developmental delay due to NALCN channelopathies. These channelopathies are often characterized by life-threatening complications, underscoring the gene's importance in neuromuscular signaling and maintenance. NALCN interacts with multiple proteins and cellular components, contributing to complex signaling pathways that include calcium signaling modulation and integration with neurohormonal systems across different cell types.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic implications of NALCN are primarily focused around its role in neurodevelopmental and neuromuscular disorders. Although specific drug interactions with NALCN are not well characterized in the current pharmacogenetic literature, understanding its genetic variations could potentially guide therapeutic strategies for diseases it is associated with. Further research is necessary to elucidate direct associations between NALCN variants and responses to particular treatments in clinical settings.
