## Gene Summary
IL1RN is the official symbol for the Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist gene. This gene plays a critical role in the immune response by encoding the interleukin 1 receptor antagonist protein, which acts to inhibit the activities of interleukin 1 (IL-1) by binding to the interleukin 1 receptor, thus preventing IL-1 itself from binding and triggering an inflammatory response. The protein product of the IL1RN gene is crucial in modulating the balance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways. It is primarily expressed in various cells particularly those involved in the immune system, such as monocytes and macrophages.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
IL1RN is implicated in several inflammatory and autoimmune conditions due to its regulatory role in inflammation. Mutations or dysregulation in the expression of IL1RN have been associated with diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus, highlighting its significance in immune regulation and pathology. It has been studied in various inflammatory pathways including those related to IL-1 signaling disruption. Research also shows associations with skin diseases like psoriasis and rare conditions such as DIRA (Deficiency of the Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist), which is characterized by severe systemic inflammation.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of IL1RN primarily involves its influence on the effectiveness and safety profiles of drugs that target the IL-1 pathway. Anakinra, a recombinant version of the IL1RN product, directly leverages the geneâ€™s mechanism as a therapeutic strategy for conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease. The genetic variations in IL1RN can affect individual responses to anakinra, potentially influencing dosing requirements and risk of side effects. Understanding the genetic variability in IL1RN can also aid in predicting the outcomes in inflammatory disease treatments where IL-1 plays a significant role.
