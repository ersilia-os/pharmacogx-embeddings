## Gene Summary
SLC13A1 stands for Solute Carrier Family 13 Member 1, which is a gene that encodes a sodium/sulfate symporter involved in the transport of sulfate ions across cell membranes. This transporter is pivotal for the uptake of sulfate in the kidneys and intestines, playing a significant role in sulfate homeostasis and detoxification processes. The expression of SLC13A1 is primarily found in kidney and small intestine tissues, highlighting its role in renal and gastrointestinal physiology.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The SLC13A1 gene is implicated in several metabolic pathways, chiefly those involving the transport and metabolism of sulfate and other anions. Alterations in the function of this gene can lead to disrupted sulfate balance, which is crucial for various biological processes including detoxification, hormone regulation, and cellular growth. Diseases associated with SLC13A1 mutations include renal tubular acidosis and related disorders of sulfate wasting. Moreover, the efficiency and regulation of this transporter can influence the pharmacokinetics of drugs and toxins that undergo sulfate conjugation as a part of their metabolism.

## Pharmacogenetics
From a pharmacogenetic perspective, variations in SLC13A1 are of interest due to their potential effect on drug metabolism, particularly for drugs that are conjugated with sulfate for renal elimination. Although specific drug associations are not extensively documented, understanding the genetic variability of this transporter could be crucial in predicting patient-specific responses to drugs, especially those involving sulfate conjugation. Continued research could elucidate more precise associations and guide personalized therapeutic strategies based on SLC13A1 genotypes.
