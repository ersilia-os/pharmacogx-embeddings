## Gene Summary
DDRGK1, or DDRGK Domain Containing 1, is a protein-coding gene that is part of the Ufm1-specific ligase system. This gene plays a significant role in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) and the unfolded protein response (UPR), processes that are essential for the removal of misfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum and maintaining cellular health. DDRGK1 has been implicated in the regulation of NF-kappaB signaling, influencing various cellular functions such as inflammation, immunity, and cell survival.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
DDRGK1 is not directly linked to specific pharmaceutical drugs but is involved closely in cellular mechanisms that could influence disease states, particularly those related to protein folding and degradation. The gene's role in ERAD and UPR implies that it could be relevant in diseases characterized by protein misfolding, such as neurodegenerative diseases. Due to its involvement in the NF-kappaB pathway, DDRGK1 may also play a role in inflammatory diseases. The association of DDRGK1 with these critical cellular pathways highlights its potential importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to cellular stress.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there is limited direct pharmacogenetic data regarding DDRGK1. Since the gene is involved in fundamental cellular processes like the UPR and NF-kappaB signaling, alterations or mutations in DDRGK1 could potentially influence the efficacy or toxicity of drugs that interact with these pathways. Pharmacogenetic associations may emerge as research continues, particularly in understanding how modulation of the protein processing pathways can affect drug responses in diseases such as cancer or autoimmune disorders. This gene's pharmacogenetics is an area ripe for further investigation, particularly concerning how its genetic variations might influence individual responses to therapies targeting ER stress and inflammation.
