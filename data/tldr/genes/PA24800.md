## Gene Summary
ANK3, or Ankyrin G, is a gene that encodes a member of the ankyrin family, which are integral membrane proteins involved in maintaining the structural integrity of cells and conducting various cellular processes. ANK3 is known for its role in linking the integral membrane proteins to the underlying spectrin-actin cytoskeleton. It plays critical roles in activities such as the establishment and maintenance of membrane domain structures of excitable membranes. ANK3 is predominantly expressed in the nervous system, particularly in the brain, where it is essential for the stabilization of ion channels at the axonal initial segment and nodes of Ranvier.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations and dysfunction in the ANK3 gene are linked to several neurological and psychiatric disorders. It has been particularly implicated in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. ANK3 variants have also been suggested to have roles in the development of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and other cognitive disorders characterized by changes in neuronal connectivity and function. The protein ANK3 is involved in critical signaling pathways that oversee the assembly and function of synapses and neural circuits, illustrating its pivotal role in cognitive and emotional behaviors as well as neurological functionality.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of ANK3 mainly pertains to its influence on the treatment of psychiatric conditions such as bipolar disorder. Studies have highlighted the connection between polymorphisms in ANK3 and the therapeutic responses to mood stabilizers like lithium, which is widely used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Individuals with specific genetic variants in ANK3 may exhibit differential responses to lithium, influencing treatment efficacy and outcome. Thus, ANK3 genotyping could potentially be used to personalize treatment plans for psychiatric conditions, optimizing therapeutic outcomes through better-targeted medication choices.
