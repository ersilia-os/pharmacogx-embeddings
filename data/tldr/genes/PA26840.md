## Gene Summary
CPS1, or carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I, is a mitochondrial enzyme critical for the urea cycle, which detoxifies ammonia by converting it into urea for excretion. This enzyme is predominantly expressed in the liver and is essential for the metabolism of nitrogen-containing compounds. CPS1 catalyzes the ATP-dependent synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate from ammonia and bicarbonate, which is the first and rate-limiting step of the urea cycle.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in CPS1 are associated with carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency, a rare genetic disorder that leads to hyperammonemia and can result in serious neurological deficits and early death if untreated. This condition reflects an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Phenotypically, individuals with CPS1 deficiency may present with lethargy, seizures, and intellectual disability. For pathways, CPS1 is integral to the urea cycle and nitrogen disposal pathways. Its activity is crucial in metabolic contexts where nitrogen balance and ammonia detoxification are critical.

## Pharmacogenetics
Within the sphere of pharmacogenetics, CPS1 has not been extensively linked to variations affecting drug response substantially in common clinical scenarios. However, understanding CPS1 activity and genetic variations can be crucial in managing conditions like CPS1 deficiency, where arginine supplementation and nitrogen scavenging drugs like sodium phenylbutyrate and sodium benzoate might be employed. These treatments help to manage ammonia levels by providing alternative pathways for nitrogen excretion. Additionally, dietary management is critical in such patients, indicating an indirect link between CPS1 activity and therapeutic strategies. Thus, while direct pharmacogenetic interactions with specific drugs are not well-established, CPS1's role in metabolic pathways influences treatment strategies for related disorders.
