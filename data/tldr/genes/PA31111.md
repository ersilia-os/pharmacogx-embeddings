## Gene Summary
MS4A1 (Membrane Spanning 4-Domains A1), also known as CD20, is a gene located on chromosome 11q12.2 and encodes the CD20 protein, which is a cell surface molecule expressed on B lymphocytes. CD20 plays a vital role in the development and differentiation of B cells into plasma cells and is involved in transmembrane calcium ion conductance. The protein does not shed, modulate, or internalize extensively, making it stable and an ideal target for therapeutic interventions, particularly in conditions related to B cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CD20 is a key target in autoimmune disorders and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), including diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The pathways associated with MS4A1 primarily involve B cell activation, signaling, and development. Due to its restriction to B cells and involvement in critical immune response pathways, MS4A1 is a significant marker in studying B cell development and signaling pathogenesis in immune disorders. It has also been studied for its role in the effectiveness of certain immunotherapy treatments.

## Pharmacogenetics
The therapeutic relevance of MS4A1 predominantly centers around its expression in certain types of cancers, particularly B-cell malignancies. Monoclonal antibodies targeting CD20, such as Rituximab, Ocrelizumab, and Ofatumumab, are critical in the treatment of diseases like non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and multiple sclerosis. These drugs bind specifically to the CD20 antigen on B cells, leading to cell death and are used to deplete B cells. Variations in MS4A1 can influence the efficacy and toxicity of these treatments, highlighting the pharmacogenetics importance of this gene in personalized medicine approaches. These interactions and responses can significantly affect treatment plans and outcomes in clinical settings, necessitating ongoing research and detailed understanding in pharmacogenomics.
