## Gene Summary
HCAR2, short for hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2, also known as GPR109A or niacin receptor 1, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved primarily in lipid metabolism and immune response modulation. The gene is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue, immune cells, and the spleen. HCAR2 mediates anti-lipolytic effects by binding to its endogenous ligands, such as Î²-hydroxybutyrate and other fatty acids. Additionally, it plays a role in the anti-inflammatory activities in the digestive tract and other peripheral tissues.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
HCAR2 is principally recognized for its role in mediating the effects of niacin (also known as vitamin B3 or nicotinic acid) on lipid levels, thus affecting conditions related to cardiovascular health. Binding of niacin to HCAR2 on adipocytes inhibits lipolysis, which can contribute to the modulation of plasma lipid profiles. Therefore, the receptor is of particular interest in managing dyslipidemia and associated disorders, such as coronary artery disease. Additionally, HCAR2's influence on immune cell function suggests its potential involvement in inflammatory diseases and possibly in the modulation of intestinal inflammation like colitis.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of HCAR2 primarily centers around its interaction with niacin, used therapeutically to manage dyslipidemia and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. Niacin's binding to HCAR2 activates a G-protein signaling pathway that results in decreased lipolysis and subsequently lower levels of serum free fatty acids. Variants in HCAR2 can influence the efficacy and side effect profile of niacin treatment. For example, certain genetic polymorphisms in HCAR2 are associated with differential responses to niacin therapy in terms of lipid lowering and flushing, a common side effect of niacin therapy. Understanding these genetic associations helps in tailoring niacin therapy for optimal efficacy and minimal adverse effects in the management of lipid disorders.
