## Gene Summary
TYMP, also known as thymidine phosphorylase, is an enzyme that is crucial in the metabolism of nucleosides, specifically converting thymidine to thymine and deoxyribose-1-phosphate. It plays an essential role in pyrimidine nucleoside salvage, a pathway important for DNA synthesis and repair. TYMP is expressed in various tissues, prominently in endothelial cells, and has been implicated in angiogenesis due to its ability to stimulate endothelial cell migration and blood vessel formation. Abnormalities in TYMP expression or function are linked to mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE), a rare multisystemic disorder.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
TYMP is closely associated with several diseases, particularly mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE). This disease is characterized by symptoms such as gastrointestinal dysmotility, neuropathy, and leukoencephalopathy. The gene is also related to cancer biology; its product, thymidine phosphorylase, is sometimes up-regulated in tumor cells, contributing to tumor growth and angiogenesis. Moreover, TYMP pathway involvement includes pyrimidine metabolism, where it plays a role in thymidine degradation—one of the salvage pathways for nucleotide synthesis. This salient feature underlines its significance in cellular proliferation and tumor biology.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, TYMP is notable for its role in influencing the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents, particularly 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Thymidine phosphorylase, the enzyme encoded by TYMP, is involved in the conversion of 5-FU to its active metabolite, fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP), which inhibits thymidylate synthase – key for DNA synthesis. An increase in TYMP expression can enhance the activation of 5-FU, potentially improving the drug’s effectiveness against cancer cells. Conversely, high levels of this enzyme might also lead to increased toxicity and side effects. Understanding the variations and expression levels of TYMP may contribute to optimizing treatment plans involving 5-FU and predicting patient responses to the therapy.
