## Gene Summary
PSORS1C1, or Psoriasis Susceptibility 1 Candidate 1, is a gene located in the major psoriasis susceptibility locus (PSORS1) on chromosome 6p21.3. This gene is situated in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex region, which is rich in genes involved in immune system function. PSORS1C1 is expressed in several tissues, including skin and thymus, which suggests a role in immune responses and possibly in the skin's integrity and repair mechanisms. Although its specific function is not fully understood, its location within a critical genomic area for autoimmune regulation points to a role in pathological processes including autoimmunity.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The PSORS1C1 gene is primarily associated with susceptibility to psoriasis, an autoimmune skin condition characterized by red, itchy, and scaly patches. The involvement of PSORS1C1 in psoriasis is supported by genetic linkage and association studies pinpointing the PSORS1 region. This locus, including PSORS1C1, has been implicated in other autoimmune disorders as well, although its role in diseases besides psoriasis needs further exploration. As for cellular pathways, while explicit pathways involving PSORS1C1 remain unclear, its proximity to genes involved in immune response regulation suggests a potential interplay with pathways governing inflammation and immune tolerance.

## Pharmacogenetics
Given its association with psoriasis, PSORS1C1's pharmacogenetics have not been directly linked with specific drug responses or treatment outcomes in psoriasis or other diseases. Further research would be necessary to define any pharmacogenetic traits associated with PSORS1C1 that could impact medical therapy, particularly in the autoimmune and dermatological contexts. However, understanding the genetic variations within the PSORS1 region, including alterations in or near PSORS1C1, may offer insights into patient-specific treatment strategies in the future, such as predicting disease course or response to immunomodulatory treatments.
