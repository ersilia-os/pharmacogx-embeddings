## Gene Summary
MTRR, or Methionine Synthase Reductase, is a key enzyme involved in the folate and methionine metabolism pathways. It plays a critical role in the regeneration of methionine synthase (MTR), which is required for the proper synthesis of methionine from homocysteine and the conversion of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. MTRR is expressed in various tissues but is particularly significant in the liver and kidney, where methionine synthesis and folate cycles are highly active.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
MTRR is implicated in several metabolic pathways, crucially in the homocysteine metabolism and methylation cycles. Mutations in MTRR can lead to hyperhomocysteinemia, which is associated with increased risks of cardiovascular diseases, birth defects, and other metabolic disorders. Clinically, MTRR mutations have been linked to inherited conditions such as methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria. These conditions manifest variably but can lead to neurological, vascular, and developmental symptoms due to impaired methylation and accumulation of toxic byproducts.

## Pharmacogenetics
MTRR's pharmacogenetics primarily relate to its role in influencing homocysteine levels and response to supplementation with vitamins like folate (B9), B12, and B6, which are used in managing hyperhomocysteinemia and related conditions. Variants in MTRR, such as C677T, can affect the enzyme efficiency and influence individual responses to these supplements. Understanding these genetic variations can guide personalized dietary and pharmacological interventions intended to mitigate associated risks of cardiovascular and neurological conditions influenced by elevated homocysteine levels.
