## Gene Summary
TEX10, officially known as Testis Expressed 10, is a gene implicated in the cellular process of ribosome biogenesis and may also play a role in transcriptional regulation. It is typically expressed in a variety of tissues but has a notable expression in the testis. The protein encoded by TEX10 is thought to be involved in chromosomal organization and has been associated with the regulation of RNA polymerase II during transcriptional activation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
TEX10 has not been directly linked to specific drugs or therapeutic interventions; however, its role in cellular proliferation and transcriptional regulation suggests a potential implication in cancer biology. Disease associations primarily include various forms of cancers such as colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. As part of the nucleolus large ribosomal subunit (LSU) biogenesis, TEX10 participates in vital cellular processes like protein synthesis and cell growth, implicating it in mechanisms that might underlie oncogenic transformation and tumor progression.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there are no direct pharmacogenetic associations involving TEX10 that dictate the outcome or efficacy of specific drug treatments. However, due to its involvement in fundamental cellular processes like RNA synthesis and ribosome biogenesis, further research could unveil potential pharmacogenetic implications. Understanding mutations or expression levels of TEX10 might eventually help in predicting the responses to drugs that target cellular proliferation and transcriptional machinery, particularly in the context of cancer therapy.
