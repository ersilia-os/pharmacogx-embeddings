## Gene Summary
HLA-DRB1 (Human Leukocyte Antigen - DR Beta 1) is part of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules located on chromosome 6. HLA-DRB1 plays a critical role in the immune system by presenting peptides derived from extracellular proteins to T cells. It is highly polymorphic, which allows it to present a wide range of antigens. The expression of HLA-DRB1 is mainly seen on antigen-presenting cells like macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells. This gene's diversity is essential for the adaptive immune system to recognize and respond to the myriad of pathogens encountered by an individual.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
HLA-DRB1 is associated with several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases due to its fundamental role in immune response. It is notably linked with diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and type 1 diabetes. The gene's involvement often relates to how immune cells recognize and interact with pathological and healthy human tissues, contributing to the disease's phenotype. The gene also plays a role in response pathways related to immune regulation, antigen presentation, and various inflammatory responses.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, HLA-DRB1 is key in determining the risk of drug hypersensitivity reactions. Specific alleles of this gene are known to predispose individuals to adverse reactions to certain drugs. For example, HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele is associated with an increased risk of developing hypersensitivity reactions to abacavir, a nucleoside analog used in the treatment of HIV. Similarly, the presence of HLA-DRB1*07:01 has been linked with liver injury provoked by ximelagatran, formerly used as an anticoagulant. Moreover, its variations influence treatment efficacy and tolerance to several immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory drugs, thus guiding personalized treatment plans in autoimmune diseases.
