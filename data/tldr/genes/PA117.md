## Gene Summary
COMT (Catechol-O-Methyltransferase) is an enzyme that is pivotal in the metabolism of catecholamines, such as dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. It functions primarily to degrade these neurotransmitters, regulating their levels in the brain and body which plays a crucial role in cognitive functions, mood regulation, and pain perception. The gene is expressed in two major forms generated by alternative splicing: the soluble (S-COMT) and the membrane-bound (MB-COMT) forms. COMT is widely expressed in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, and brain. Its activity influences several neurological and psychiatric conditions.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
COMT is involved in several key pathways, including the metabolism of drugs, the degradation of catecholamine neurotransmitters, and the methylation pathway. Abnormalities in COMT function and expression are linked to a range of neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Phenotypic variations in COMT activity due to genetic polymorphisms can influence individual susceptibility to these conditions. Furthermore, low COMT activity has been associated with pain sensitivity and fibromyalgia.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of COMT predominantly revolves around its role in drug metabolism and the impact of its genetic variants on disease risk and treatment outcomes. One common polymorphism in the COMT gene, Val158Met (rs4680), results in a substitution of methionine for valine, reducing the activity of the enzyme. This polymorphism has been studied extensively for its implications in response to psychiatric medication, particularly in the treatment of schizophrenia and depression. Drugs like antipsychotics (e.g., olanzapine) and stimulants used in ADHD are influenced by COMT activity. The efficacy and side effects of these medications can vary significantly depending on an individualâ€™s COMT genotype; for instance, individuals with the Met/Met genotype (low enzyme activity) might experience different drug effects or side effects compared to those with the Val/Val genotype.
