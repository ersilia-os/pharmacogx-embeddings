## Gene Summary
ACHE (acetylcholinesterase) is an enzyme critical in the function of the nervous system. It is responsible for the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into choline and acetate, terminating signal transmission at cholinergic synapses and neuromuscular junctions. This enzyme is especially significant in the function of neuromuscular junctions involving muscle activation. ACHE is encoded in the human genome on chromosome 7q22. ACHE expression is predominantly observed in nervous tissue but can also be found in various other tissues including blood cells and muscle.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ACHE has been implicated in several pathological conditions, primarily those involving excessive or deregulated cholinergic activity. Diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Myasthenia Gravis have been associated with alterations in ACHE activity or expression. ACHE is also a target in the management of glaucoma, wherein ACHE inhibitors help increase aqueous humor outflow. This gene is part of the cholinergic synapse pathway, playing a crucial role in synaptic transmission and muscle activation. Inhibition of ACHE activity can cause an accumulation of acetylcholine, leading to prolonged muscle contraction and potential toxic effects.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, ACHE's role is central in determining susceptibility and response to certain drugs, particularly acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) used to treat diseases like Alzheimerâ€™s and Myasthenia Gravis. Drugs such as Donepezil, Rivastigmine, and Pyridostigmine target ACHE to increase concentrations of acetylcholine in neuronal synapses, enhancing cholinergic transmission. Genetic polymorphisms in ACHE can influence the efficacy and safety of these drugs. For instance, polymorphisms leading to altered enzyme activity might affect drug dosing, efficacy, and risk of adverse effects, such as cholinergic toxicities. In pesticide exposure, individuals with certain ACHE mutations may have altered risk or severity of toxicity due to organophosphates, which are potent ACHE inhibitors. Understanding these genetic variations informs personalized medicine approaches, aiming to maximize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing adverse effects.
