## Gene Summary
DDO (D-aspartate oxidase) is a gene that encodes the enzyme D-aspartate oxidase, which is involved in the catabolism of D-amino acids, primarily D-aspartate and D-glutamate. This enzyme is predominantly expressed in the liver and kidney, with a critical role in the regulation of D-amino acid levels in the neural and endocrine systems. DDO functions by degrading D-aspartate, an important neuromodulator in the central nervous system and a regulator of hormone synthesis in the endocrine system.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
DDO is associated with modulating neurotransmitter levels and thus potentially impacts neurological functions and disorders. Dysregulation of DDO activity has been suggested to influence conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, where altered levels of D-amino acids are often observed. The enzyme participates in amino acid degradation pathways, specifically those involving the oxidative deamination of D-amino acids, contributing to the cellular amino acid pool and energy metabolism.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there is limited information on direct pharmacogenetic associations between DDO and specific drugs or therapeutic interventions. However, indirect evidence suggests that manipulation of the D-amino acid pathways, where DDO is a key player, could influence the efficacy and safety of drugs targeting neurological disorders, where D-amino acid signaling is altered. Future research into the pharmacogenetics of DDO may reveal valuable insights for the development of targeted therapies in neuropsychiatric disorders or metabolic imbalances involving amino acids.
