## Gene Summary
PIK3R2, or phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 2, is a gene that encodes one of the regulatory subunits of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). PI3Ks are enzymes involved in various cellular functions including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, survival, and intracellular trafficking, which are important processes for cancer metabolism and tumor growth. PIK3R2 specifically forms part of the PI3K regulatory component that binds to PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate), leading to the activation of the catalytic subunit when cell signaling proteins such as growth factors or insulin are present. The gene is broadly expressed in many tissues but has notable roles in the nervous system and in immune cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
PIK3R2 is implicated in several pathways such as the Akt signaling pathway, which plays a key role in mediating cellular responses to growth factors. Deregulation of this pathway can lead to diseases like cancers, including gliomas, breast cancer, and gastric cancer. Specifically, PIK3R2, through its role in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, contributes to the regulation of processes such as angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell growth, and metabolism, all of which are crucial in cancer pathophysiology. Mutations in PIK3R2 have been linked to the development of megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome (MPPH syndrome), indicating its significant role in neural development and proper brain structure formation.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, PIK3R2 holds potential significance mainly due to its role in cancer-related pathways. The gene's involvement in PI3K-mediated signaling makes it a potential target for drugs designed to inhibit the PI3K-Akt pathway, which is a common strategy in targeted cancer therapy. PI3K inhibitors like copanlisib and idelalisib target pathways involving the PIK3R2 subunit. Understanding the genetic variants of PIK3R2 can provide insight into the efficacy and toxicity of these drugs. Research continues to explore the impact of specific PIK3R2 mutations or polymorphisms on the response to these PI3K inhibitors, offering prospects of personalized medicine approaches in cancers where PIK3R2 is mutated or aberrantly expressed. Additionally, pharmacogenetic interactions involving PIK3R2 also have implications in the treatment of neurological disorders due to its crucial role in brain development and function.
