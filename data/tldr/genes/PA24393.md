## Gene Summary
ABCC11, also known as ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 11, is a protein-coding gene that plays a significant role in the ATP-dependent transport of various molecules across cellular membranes. This gene is involved in the transport of organic anions and drug conjugates and is particularly noted for its contribution to apocrine gland secretion. ABCC11 is expressed in numerous tissues including the liver, kidney, and especially in the apocrine glands where it affects sweat composition and earwax type.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ABCC11 is associated with multiple phenotypic traits, the most notable being earwax type (wet or dry) which is influenced by a single nucleotide polymorphism in this gene. Differences in earwax type have been linked to varied susceptibilities to certain diseases, including breast cancer and axillary osmidrosis, where body odor becomes pronounced due to the breakdown of apocrine gland secretions. Also, pathways involving ABCC11 include those related to drug transport and metabolism, impacting the pharmacokinetics of several medicinally relevant compounds.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic relevance of ABCC11 mainly revolves around its ability to modulate the transport and efficacy of several drugs. Variant alleles of this gene have been shown to alter the effectiveness and side effects profile of certain medications. Notably, it impacts the metabolism and response to drugs like axitinib, a cancer therapy agent, by altering drug excretion rates which could potentially affect both efficacy and toxicity. In genetic testing, the status of ABCC11 can inform personalized treatment plans, particularly in cancer therapy, by predicting patient response to specific drugs based on their earwax type (and by extension, their ABCC11 genotype). This aspect of personalized medicine highlights the growing importance of understanding individual genetic backgrounds in achieving optimal therapeutic outcomes.
