## Gene Summary
NEDD4 (neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 4) is a gene that encodes an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. This enzyme is crucial in the ubiquitination process, which involves adding ubiquitin to a substrate protein, leading to its degradation by the proteasome or modification of its function. NEDD4 is known for its role in regulating various cellular processes including endocytosis, signaling pathways, and ion transport. It is broadly expressed in many tissues but shows a higher expression in neural tissues, reflecting its name's origin. The protein interacts with multiple target proteins through its WW domains, which recognize specific proline-rich motifs.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NEDD4 is implicated in a range of cellular pathways, particularly those linked to cell signaling and membrane protein turnover. It regulates the stability and function of a variety of ion channels and receptors, including epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) and PTEN, influencing processes like sodium reabsorption in the kidney and cell survival pathways. Dysfunction of NEDD4 has been associated with both cancer development and progression, mainly due to its role in the ubiquitination and degradation of tumor suppressor proteins and oncogenes. In neurological contexts, alterations in NEDD4 function could potentially impact neural development and neurodegenerative diseases although clear links require further investigation.

## Pharmacogenetics
NEDD4's role in pharmacogenetics is still understudied, but its involvement in drug responses is indirectly appreciated through its regulation of membrane proteins like ion channels and receptors. For example, its interaction with ENaC could influence the activity of diuretics, which are used to control blood pressure by affecting sodium and water retention. Better understanding of NEDD4's specific interactions with various drugs might contribute to personalized medicine, particularly in fields like oncology, where modulation of protein degradation pathways could affect tumor responsiveness to chemotherapeutics. As research progresses, the pharmacogenetics of NEDD4 could gain more traction, potentially leading to novel therapeutic strategies that target its ubiquitin ligase activity.
