## Gene Summary
KLRC1, also known as Killer Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C Member 1, is a gene located on chromosome 12 in humans. It encodes a protein that is part of the killer cell lectin-like receptor (KLR) family, which includes receptors involved in the regulation of natural killer (NK) cell function. KLRC1 proteins are expressed mainly on the surface of NK cells and a subset of T cells and are integral in the recognition and elimination of virus-infected and tumor cells. The activation of these receptors leads to the release of cytotoxic granules that cause target cell lysis.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
KLRC1 is involved in several crucial immunological pathways, including the Natural Killer Cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathway. Through its function, it plays a significant role in modulating immune responses and maintaining immune surveillance. The receptor's interaction with its ligands can consequently influence the development and progression of various diseases, particularly infectious diseases and cancers. Mutations and alterations in the expression of KLRC1 have been examined for correlations with susceptibility to certain viral infections and immune disorders.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of KLRC1 are still largely unexplored, potentially due to its predominant involvement in innate immune responses rather than direct interactions with drugs. Nonetheless, understanding variations within the KLRC1 gene could lead to insights into individual differences in immune responses to infections or efficacy in treatments that modify immune activity, like immunotherapies used in cancer treatment. As research advances, the gene may also reveal associations with the effectiveness of certain antiviral therapies, where the activation of NK cells plays a critical role.
