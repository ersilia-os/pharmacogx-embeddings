## Gene Summary
**CTNNB1** (Catenin Beta 1) is a crucial protein coding gene involved in numerous cellular functions including cell adhesion, regulation of gene transcription, and maintaining the integrity of the epithelial architecture through its role in the Wnt signaling pathway. CTNNB1 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, with vital roles in embryonic development and adult tissue maintenance. In cells, CTNNB1 functions by regulating the connection between the cadherins and the actin cytoskeleton, influencing both cellular adhesion and signaling.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CTNNB1 is implicated in a wide array of pathways, notably the Wnt signaling pathway, which plays a critical role in the control of gene expression, cellular behavior, proliferation, and differentiation. Mutations and dysregulation in CTNNB1 are associated with several diseases, including various cancers such as colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, medulloblastoma, and ovarian cancer. Its aberrant activation has also been linked to desmoid tumors and pilomatricoma, reflecting its pivotal role in cell growth and differentiation processes. The gene's involvement in such essential signaling pathways makes it a significant focus in oncology and targeted cancer therapies.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, CTNNB1's significance has been studied mainly in the context of its mutations' responsiveness to certain targeted therapies in cancer. For instance, drugs designed to inhibit Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling are of particular interest in treating cancers driven by aberrant activation of the CTNNB1 pathway. Although specific widely used drugs targeting CTNNB1 are not yet standard, the gene's role in cancer pathogenesis makes it an attractive target for new drug development. Research continues to explore inhibitors that can specifically modulate CTNNB1-related activity in oncological applications. Additionally, the gene's mutations can influence the efficacy of existing treatments and serve as biomarkers for the identification of therapeutic outcomes.
