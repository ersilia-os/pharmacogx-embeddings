## Gene Summary
PPARD, or Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Delta, is a nuclear hormone receptor that regulates the expression of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, energy homeostasis, and inflammation. This gene plays a crucial role in the regulation of cellular differentiation, development, and metabolism across multiple biological systems. PPARD is predominantly expressed in the brain, adipose tissue, skin, and several other tissues, where it influences a range of physiological processes. It functions by forming heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and binding to specific response elements on DNA to modulate gene expression.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
PPARD is integral to pathways that mediate lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis, which makes it a target for drugs aimed at treating metabolic disorders. It is also involved in the regulation of insulin sensitivity, fatty acid oxidation, and cholesterol metabolism. Diseases such as dyslipidemia, obesity, and type 2 diabetes are associated with anomalies in PPARD expression and function. Moreover, because of its role in inflammation and cellular differentiation, PPARD influences conditions related to these biological processes, potentially including certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of PPARD is significant in the context of metabolic disorders, particularly those linked to lipid metabolism and insulin resistance. PPARD agonists such as selective PPAR modulators have been explored for their potential benefits in improving lipid profiles and insulin sensitivity. These drugs could potentially alleviate symptoms in conditions like hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. Variation in the PPARD gene may influence individual responses to these treatments, impacting the efficacy and safety of drugs that target PPARD pathways. Understanding these genetic variations can guide personalized treatment plans that optimize therapeutic outcomes while minimizing adverse effects.
