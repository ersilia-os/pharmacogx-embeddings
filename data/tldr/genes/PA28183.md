## Gene Summary
**FLT4**, officially known as Fms Related Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 4, is a gene that encodes the VEGFR-3 protein, which is one of the cell surface receptors for vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF). This receptor plays a crucial role in the development of the lymphatic system and in endothelial cell function. FLT4 is primarily expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells and is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and endothelial cell growth. The function of this receptor is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of the vascular network during embryonic development and in adult physiology.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
FLT4 is linked to several pathophysiological conditions, particularly those involving the vascular and lymphatic systems. Mutations and dysregulation of this gene are associated with lymphedema, particularly hereditary lymphedema type IA. FLT4 signaling is also involved in cancer biology, with its expression being noted in the progression and metastasis of various cancers, including breast cancer and lymphoma. In terms of pathways, FLT4 is critical in the VEGF signaling pathway, which influences vascular permeability, endothelial cell migration, and survival. The interaction of FLT4 with its ligands leads to the activation of multiple downstream signaling cascades, including PI3K-AKT and Ras-MAPK pathways.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of FLT4 primarily revolves around its role in cancer treatment, as it is a target in therapies aimed at inhibiting angiogenesis and tumor growth. In the context of targeted cancer therapy, drugs like bevacizumab (Avastin), which targets VEGF, indirectly influence FLT4 function by modulating VEGF activity in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, selective FLT4 inhibitors and FLT4-targeted therapies are under investigation for their potential to treat diseases like solid tumors by inhibiting lymphangiogenesis. Being at the forefront of targeted therapies, understanding the genetic variations within FLT4 can provide insights into individual responses to these therapies, although specific high-impact variants with clinical pharmacogenetic implications have not yet been well defined.
