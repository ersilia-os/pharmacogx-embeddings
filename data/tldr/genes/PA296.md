## Gene Summary
**RELA**, also known as v-rel avian reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A, is a crucial component of the NF-kappa-B complex, which plays a significant role in regulating the transcription of DNA, cytokine production, and cell survival. This gene's protein product, often referred to as p65, is a Rel-like domain-containing protein and is essential for NF-kappa-B's nuclear translocation and activation in response to various stimuli, including cytokines, free radicals, ultraviolet irradiation, and bacterial or viral products. RELA is prevalently active in immune system regulation and has been implicated in responses to inflammation, cellular proliferation, and apoptosis.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
RELA is centrally involved in the NF-kappa-B signaling pathway, integral to inflammatory and immune responses. Dysregulation of this pathway and the RELA gene has been linked to a variety of diseases including various types of cancer (e.g., breast, colon, and lung cancer), inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. Its relation to cancer stems from its role in controlling cell proliferation and apoptosis, processes often hijacked in tumorigenic pathways. Inflammatory signals inducing overactivation of RELA can lead to chronic inflammation, contributing to a range of inflammatory diseases.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, research into RELA has primarily explored its implications in cancer therapy, where RELA expression levels can influence responses to specific treatments. For example, drugs targeting NF-kappa-B pathway components, such as proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib, are used in specific cancers, and their effectiveness can be modulated by RELA activity. RELA's role in mediating inflammatory responses also poses potential in influencing the efficacy and therapeutic outcomes of anti-inflammatory drugs. Understanding patient-specific variations in the RELA gene could guide personalized therapeutic approaches targeting the NF-kappa-B pathway, offering potential for improved outcomes in treatments of inflammatory and neoplastic diseases.
