## Gene Summary
SRR, also known as serine racemase, is a gene that encodes an enzyme involved in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter D-serine, which is a co-agonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The SRR enzyme catalyzes the racemization of L-serine to D-serine, a key process in the modulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission. Beyond its primary expression in the brain, SRR is also expressed in other tissues, although its function in these areas is less understood. D-serine is known to play a crucial role in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SRR has been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders, reflecting its role in modulating NMDA receptor activity. Altered D-serine levels have been associated with diseases such as schizophrenia, Alzheimerâ€™s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Phenotypically, variations in SRR activity or expression can influence neurological functions and potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions. The SRR pathway, involving serine to D-serine conversion contingent on NMDA receptor functioning, is critical for proper glutamatergic signaling and neural plasticity.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of SRR mainly revolves around its impact on conditions like schizophrenia that involve NMDA receptor dysfunction. Although there are no direct drug associations exclusively targeting SRR, understanding its function and the role of D-serine has driven the use of D-serine itself or drugs modifying serine levels as adjuvant treatments in schizophrenia. Drugs that increase NMDA receptor activity are theorized to potentially ameliorate symptoms by modulating the altered glutamate neurotransmission found in schizophrenia patients. Fluorinated analogs of D-serine are being explored as more potent alternatives due to better pharmacokinetic properties.
