## Gene Summary
CEP68, or centrosomal protein 68, is a protein-coding gene involved in the structural integrity and organization of the centrosome during interphase of the cell cycle. The protein encoded by CEP68 plays a vital role in centrosome cohesion by acting as a physical linker between the mother and daughter centrioles, which are key components of the centrosome. Dysfunction or abnormal expression of CEP68 has been implicated in abnormal cell division and may influence chromosomal stability.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Research regarding CEP68 is still emerging, with less clearly defined direct involvement in specific diseases compared to more extensively studied genes. However, given its fundamental role in cell cycle regulation and centrosome function, CEP68 may be indirectly related to diseases characterized by abnormalities in cell division such as cancers. Pathways involving CEP68 primarily include those related to the cell cycle and mitotic roles of the centrosome. There is ongoing investigation into how mutations or variation in CEP68 expression levels impact cellular phenotypes, particularly in cancer biology.

## Pharmacogenetics
As of the latest available data, CEP68 has not been heavily studied from a pharmacogenetics viewpoint, and there are no well-established pharmacogenetic associations with specific drugs. The geneâ€™s role in cell cycle regulation suggests that future pharmacogenetic research could explore its potential influence on the efficacy or toxicity of anticancer therapies, especially those targeting the mitotic machinery or cell division processes. As research in this area progresses, more detailed information may become available on how genetic variants in CEP68 affect drug response.
