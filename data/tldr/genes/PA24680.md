## Gene Summary
AKR1C4, or Aldo-Keto Reductase Family 1 Member C4, is part of the AKR1C subfamily within the aldo-keto reductase superfamily. This enzyme functions in the metabolism of steroids, prostaglandins, and lipids. It primarily acts to reduce or oxidize multiple substrates, including steroid hormones and prostaglandins in the liver and other tissues. AKR1C4 is involved in the metabolism of important biological molecules, playing roles in the conversion of aldehydes and ketones to their corresponding alcohols through its reductase activity.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The AKR1C4 enzyme is implicated in diverse pathways such as the metabolism of drugs and the synthesis and degradation of steroid hormones and prostaglandins. Through its enzymatic activity, it is associated with the pathogenesis of various hormone-dependent cancers and may influence disorders related to steroid hormone imbalance. AKR1C4 is also relevant in the bioactivation or detoxification of many exogenous and endogenous compounds. As such, changes in its expression or activity can have significant biochemical and physiological effects.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the pharmacogenetics context, variations within the AKR1C4 gene can influence the metabolism of certain drugs and environmental chemicals, altering drug efficacy and toxicity. The enzyme encoded by AKR1C4 is involved in the metabolism of commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like diclofenac and ibuprofen, which could affect drug clearance rates and adverse effect profiles. While specific drugs predominantly associated with AKR1C4 are not widely recognized unlike other members of the AKR family, the general impact of AKR1C enzymes on drug metabolism suggests potential individual differences in response to a broader array of chemical exposures and treatments based on AKR1C4 genetic variants.
