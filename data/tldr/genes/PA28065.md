## Gene Summary
FCGR3A, or Fc fragment of IgG receptor IIIa, is a gene that encodes for a protein known as CD16a, predominantly expressed on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and a subset of T cells. The protein is involved in the process of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) where it recognizes and binds to the Fc portion of IgG antibodies, subsequently activating immune responses aimed at destroying antibody-labeled target cells. This receptor plays a crucial role in immune response regulation and is integral to the coordination of innate and adaptive immune system interactions.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
FCGR3A is implicated in various autoimmune diseases and immune response-mediated conditions. The gene is associated with susceptibility to several autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, due to its role in immune complex clearance and inflammation. In terms of cancer, FCGR3A influences the efficacy of therapeutic antibodies through its role in ADCC, making it significant in treatments employing monoclonal antibodies. Pathway associations include immune response signaling, particularly interactions with cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, and involvement in Phagocytosis - a key player in antigen processing.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, FCGR3A is noteworthy primarily because of its polymorphisms that affect the affinity of the receptor for IgG subclasses, notably influencing the outcomes of treatments with therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Variants such as FCGR3A-V158F significantly impact the clinical responses to anticancer monoclonal antibody therapies like rituximab (used in lymphoma and leukemia), trastuzumab (used in HER2-positive breast cancer), and cetuximab (used in colorectal and head and neck cancers). Patients with the high-affinity 158V allele often exhibit better responses to these treatments, attributed to more effective ADCC activity. Thus, genotyping of FCGR3A may guide more personalized and effective therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment, impacting dosing and selection of therapeutic antibodies.
