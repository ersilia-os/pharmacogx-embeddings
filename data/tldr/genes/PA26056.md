## Gene Summary
CAPG (Capping Actin Protein, Gelsolin Like) is involved in regulating actin dynamics, which is crucial for cellular processes such as movement, differentiation, and proliferation. This gene encodes a member of the gelsolin/villin family of actin-regulatory proteins, controlling the assembly and disassembly of actin filaments. CAPG is expressed in a wide variety of tissues, including many cancer cell types where it influences cell motility, adhesion, and morphology. Its activity is essential for effective cytokinesis during cell division, and it also plays a role in receptor-mediated endocytosis.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CAPG is implicated in various pathological conditions, particularly its overexpression in multiple cancer types such as breast, ovarian, and liver cancers, suggesting its role in tumor progression and metastasis. It contributes to a phenotype associated with enhanced cell migration and invasiveness. Pathways involving CAPG include those related to actin cytoskeleton regulationâ€”important in processes like cellular motility and maintaining cell structure integrity. The deregulation of these pathways can influence tumor cell behavior, potentially affecting prognosis and therapeutic outcomes in cancer patients.

## Pharmacogenetics
Current pharmacogenetic research on CAPG primarily explores its potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis rather than direct associations with drug responses. However, understanding CAPG's role in cancer cell mechanics and its involvement in important signaling pathways could guide the development of targeted therapies, such as those aiming to modulate actin dynamics or inhibit specific protein interactions involved in cancer metastasis. Though there are no direct drug associations currently established, the gene's influence on cell motility and metastasis highlights its potential relevance in therapies targeting cancer spread and invasiveness. Future pharmacogenetic investigations could yield more precise drug targets or biomarkers related to CAPG function.
