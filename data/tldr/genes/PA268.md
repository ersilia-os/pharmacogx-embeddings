## Gene Summary
ABCB4 stands for ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily B Member 4, a gene encoding the protein Multidrug Resistance Protein 3 (MDR3), which is a member of the ABC transporter family. ABCB4 plays a crucial role in the transportation of phospholipids from hepatocytes into the bile, an essential process that protects the biliary tract from the detergent action of bile salts. The protein is primarily expressed in the liver, particularly in the canalicular (apical) membrane of hepatocytes. Mutations or dysfunction in ABCB4 are implicated in several liver-related disorders.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ABCB4 is prominently associated with several cholestatic liver diseases. Conditions linked to mutations or dysfunction in this gene include Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3), a severe pediatric liver disorder; Bile Duct Cancer; Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy (ICP); and Drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Moreover, ABCB4 dysfunction contributes to Low Phospholipid-Associated Cholelithiasis (LPAC) syndrome, characterized by the formation of gallstones. The gene operates within the lipid transport pathways and influences the composition and flow of bile, a key aspect influencing many of these conditions.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the field of pharmacogenetics, ABCB4 has notable associations with the efficacy and safety profiles of certain medications, impacting patient management strategies. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a commonly used treatment for cholestatic liver diseases, exhibits varying degrees of effectiveness potentially influenced by ABCB4 variants. In individuals with specific mutations in ABCB4, there is an observed resistance or diminished response to UDCA treatment. Additionally, variations in this gene are linked with differential risk and severity of Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) caused by various medications, influencing therapeutic decisions in clinical settings. Understanding the patient-specific ABCB4 genotype can guide the selection and dosing of medications to optimize therapy and minimize adverse effects.
