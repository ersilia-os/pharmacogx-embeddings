## Gene Summary
COQ2 (Coenzyme Q2, Polyprenyltransferase) is a gene that encodes the COQ2 enzyme, important in the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) which is essential for mitochondrial bioenergetics. Coenzyme Q10 functions as an electron carrier in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, crucial for ATP production. COQ2 specifically catalyzes the prenylation of para-hydroxybenzoate (PHB) with an isoprenyl chain, derived from farnesyl pyrophosphate, producing the CoQ10 intermediate. CoQ10 serves as an essential antioxidant, protecting cells from oxidative stress. The expression of COQ2 is widespread but is particularly significant in tissues with high metabolic rates such as the heart, liver, and kidney.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in COQ2 have been associated with primary CoQ10 deficiency, a rare hereditary disorder that affects the nervous system and the muscles. This condition can manifest in various forms, ranging from nephrotic syndrome to neurodegenerative disorders, depending on the mutation's severity and location within the gene. COQ2 deficiency specifically leads to decreased levels of CoQ10, impairing mitochondrial function and energy production. Studies have also linked alterations in COQ2 to increased risks for conditions like Parkinson's disease, highlighting its role in neurological health. Pathway analysis underscores its role in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which is critical for cellular energy production and metabolism.

## Pharmacogenetics
From a pharmacogenetics perspective, COQ2 interacts with drugs that affect mitochondrial function or are dependent on CoQ10 levels. While specific well-characterized drug-gene interactions involving COQ2 are not extensively documented, the gene's role in influencing CoQ10 levels suggests potential interactions with statins, such as simvastatin and atorvastatin, which are known to occasionally reduce CoQ10 levels as a side effect of their mechanism in lowering cholesterol. This reduction can lead to statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS), such as myalgia and muscle weakness. Thus, understanding genetic variations in COQ2 could help predict and manage these side effects, optimizing statin therapy efficacy and safety. Supplements containing CoQ10 are often used to mitigate these side effects, suggesting a compensatory mechanism through exogenous CoQ10 supply.
