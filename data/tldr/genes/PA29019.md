## Gene Summary
GSTA4, or Glutathione S-transferase alpha 4, is part of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene family, which consists of enzymes playing a critical role in detoxification. GSTA4 specifically catalyzes the conjugation of reduced glutathione to various electrophilic compounds in the detoxification process. This enzyme particularly shows high activity toward 4-hydroxynonenal, a product of lipid peroxidation often increased during oxidative stress and related to signaling lipid peroxidation products. Expression of GSTA4 is seen across various tissues, but notably in the liver and kidney, where detoxification processes are predominant.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
GSTA4, by function, is involved in the metabolism of a wide array of harmful substances and drugs. This includes participation in metabolism pathways like the glutathione metabolism pathway. Dysfunction or altered activity of this enzyme has been linked to various oxidative stress-related conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and certain neurological disorders. Further, its role in metabolizing lipid peroxidation byproducts implicates it in conditions characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, the study of GSTA4 is critical primarily due to its role in drug metabolism, which can influence drug efficacy and toxicity. For example, variability in the GSTA4 gene might impact how individuals process certain chemotherapy drugs, especially those that are substrates of glutathione-conjugation reactions. As researchers dig deeper, it is likely that specific drugs that undergo extensive metabolization through pathways involving GSTA4 will emerge, highlighting the potential for personalizing dosages to improve therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects. However, as of now, specific drug associations remain under-investigated and require more targeted research.
