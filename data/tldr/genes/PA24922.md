## Gene Summary
AQP4, or Aquaporin 4, is a protein-coding gene vital for water transport in the central nervous system, especially in astrocytes surrounding the brain's blood vessels. AQP4 facilitates the movement of water across cell membranes, influencing various physiological processes, such as maintaining water balance in tissues and assisting in the formation and clearance of cerebral spinal fluid. The gene expression of AQP4 is particularly high in the brain, specifically in the astrocytic foot processes at the blood-brain barrier, but it is also found in other tissues like kidney and skeletal muscle.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The dysfunction or altered expression of AQP4 is associated with a number of neurological disorders and conditions. A key disease related to AQP4 is neuromyelitis optica (NMO), an autoimmune disorder where antibodies against AQP4 (called AQP4-IgG) attack the central nervous system. This leads to demyelination, primarily affecting the optic nerves and spinal cord. Additionally, abnormalities in AQP4 functioning or expression have been implicated in brain edema formation following trauma, ischemic stroke, and in certain types of epilepsy. The gene plays a role in pathways primarily concerned with the regulation of water homeostasis and neurological signaling.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, the focus on AQP4 has primarily been related to its role in the pathophysiology of conditions rather than direct interactions with drugs. However, research into modulating AQP4 expression or function for therapeutic purposes, particularly in diseases like NMO, is ongoing. Understanding how variations in the AQP4 gene affect disease manifestation and response to therapies could lead to more tailored treatments. For instance, therapeutics that can modulate water transport activity may benefit conditions like cerebral edema or neuromyelitis optica, although specific drugs targeting AQP4 directly are currently limited but under investigation.
