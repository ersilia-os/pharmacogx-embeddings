## Gene Summary
ZNF804A, or zinc finger protein 804A, is a gene located on chromosome 2. Notable for its involvement in neural biology, ZNF804A is implicated in the regulation of various neuronal activities and processes. The gene encodes a protein that contains a C2H2-type zinc finger domain, suggesting a role in DNA binding, which typically influences transcription regulation. Expression studies indicate that ZNF804A is prominently expressed in the brain, specifically in regions implicated in higher cognitive functions and the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ZNF804A has been most notably associated with the susceptibility to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Genetic studies have consistently identified variations in ZNF804A as risk factors for these conditions, suggesting an integral role in mental health. Research into phenotypes associated with alterations in this gene also points to potential implications in other neurological and psychiatric phenotypes. Despite these associations, the pathways involving ZNF804A have not been fully elucidated but likely involve regulation of gene expression and neural connectivity in the central nervous system.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the field of pharmacogenetics, ZNF804A is beginning to attract attention, primarily in the context of response to treatment in psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia. The gene's variants, including a well-studied single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs1344706, have been explored for their impact on the efficacy and response rates to antipsychotic drugs. Findings suggest that certain alleles of ZNF804A may influence how patients respond to medication, potentially offering a genetic marker to tailor psychiatric treatments more effectively. Further research is required to conclusively define the gene's impact on drug response and to potentially integrate these findings into clinical practice for personalized medicine.
