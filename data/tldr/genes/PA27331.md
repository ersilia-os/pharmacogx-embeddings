## Gene Summary
CYB5R3, short for Cytochrome B5 Reductase 3, is a gene that encodes for an enzyme playing a critical role in the electron transport system. This enzyme is involved in multiple metabolic processes, including fatty acid desaturation and elongation, cholesterol biosynthesis, and drug metabolism. CYB5R3 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with higher expression levels noted in erythrocytes. The enzyme encoded by CYB5R3 is also essential for the reduction of methemoglobin to hemoglobin, which is crucial for effective oxygen transport in the blood.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CYB5R3 is connected with Methemoglobinemia, specifically types I and II, which are characterized by an increased amount of methemoglobin, leading to cyanosis and a variety of other symptoms due to reduced oxygen delivery to tissues. The gene's product interacts with and affects several metabolic pathways that are foundational to human biochemistry, including steroid synthesis and metabolism of xenobiotics. Variants and mutations in CYB5R3 can lead to varying severity of Methemoglobinemia, depending on whether the mutation impairs cellular or soluble forms of the enzyme.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of CYB5R3 revolves mainly around its role in drug metabolism pathways, particularly in how the body processes certain drugs that can induce Methemoglobinemia as a side effect. Drugs known to be influenced by the activity of CYB5R3 include Aniline Dyes, Benzocaine, Dapsone, and Primaquine among others. Mutations in CYB5R3 which result in deficient enzyme activity can lead to increased susceptibility to drug-induced Methemoglobinemia. Thus, understanding an individual's CYB5R3 genetic makeup can be crucial in predicting and managing potential adverse reactions to these drugs, especially in clinical scenarios requiring the use of such medications.
