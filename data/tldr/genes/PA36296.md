## Gene Summary
TBXT, also known as T (Brachyury homolog) or T-box transcription factor T, is a gene crucial in the development and proper formation of the posterior mesoderm. As a member of the T-box family of transcription factors, TBXT plays a pivotal role in the differentiation of mesoderm-derived tissues, including the notochord and somites, which are essential for the development of the vertebral column and axial skeleton. Expression of TBXT is notably active during early embryonic stages where it fundamentally influences the body plan by specifying posterior fate and promoting mesodermal differentiation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations or dysfunction in the TBXT gene are primarily associated with developmental disorders. The most recognized condition related to TBXT mutations is sacral agenesis, a congenital disorder characterized by the improper formation of the lower spine, which can impact lower limb and organ function. Beyond isolated sacral agenesis, TBXT is involved in the complex genetics of caudal regression syndrome, where a spectrum of developmental abnormalities are observed. Pathway involvement includes those governing developmental signaling and skeletal formation, notably pathways mediated by TGF-beta signaling which influence cell growth, differentiation, and development.

## Pharmacogenetics
Given the fundamental role of TBXT in developmental processes rather than in the metabolism or action of drugs, its direct associations with pharmacogenetics are not as prominent as with genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes or drug transporters. However, understanding the genetic variability within the TBXT gene could potentially influence therapeutic approaches in regenerative medicine or treatments aimed at developmental disorders. In these contexts, knowledge about TBXT function might guide the use of pathway-modifying drugs or biological therapies that aim to correct or compensate for the developmental disruptions caused by its mutations. Currently, there are no direct pharmacogenetic associations involving TBXT with specific drugs described in the literature.
