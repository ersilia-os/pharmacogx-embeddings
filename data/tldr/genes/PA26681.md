## Gene Summary
CNR1 is the official symbol for the cannabinoid receptor 1, also known as the CB1 receptor. This gene is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and basal ganglia, playing a pivotal role in the endocannabinoid system. CNR1 modulates neurotransmitter release in response to its activation and is involved in various physiological processes including appetite, pain-sensation, mood, and memory.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CNR1 has been linked to several drugs, particularly those targeting neurological and psychiatric conditions. It plays a critical role in the pathways related to the effects of cannabis and the potential therapeutic aspects of cannabinoid-related treatments. Diseases associated with CNR1 include drug dependence, obesity, neuropathic pain, and schizophrenia, among others. Phenotypic effects of variations within this gene can influence individual responses to cannabinoid drugs, affecting both therapeutic outcomes and the risk of side effects such as cognitive impairments and psychological disturbances.

## Pharmacogenetics
CNR1 exhibits significant pharmacogenetic interest since variations in this gene can influence the effectiveness and tolerability of cannabinoid-based therapies. Known polymorphisms in CNR1, such as rs1049353, have been associated with differential drug responses. For example, the response to drugs like Dronabinol, which is used in the treatment of anorexia associated with weight loss in AIDS patients and nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy, can be affected by CNR1 genetic variants. Studies suggest CNR1 polymorphisms may alter receptor function or expression, potentially modifying drug efficacy and the risk of adverse effects, highlighting the need for personalized approaches in cannabinoid pharmacotherapy.
