## Gene Summary
ADORA3, also known as the A3 adenosine receptor gene, is a member of the adenosine receptor group which also includes ADORA1, ADORA2A, and ADORA2B. These receptors are integral membrane proteins that are involved in various intracellular signaling pathways and physiological functions. ADORA3 is widely expressed with higher concentrations in the lung, liver, and testis. The encoded A3 receptor binds adenosine, which plays a key role in bioenergetic and cellular homeostasis processes. Activation of ADORA3 can induce various responses such as anti-inflammatory effects and inhibition of immune cell function.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ADORA3 is implicated in various pathological conditions, particularly those related to inflammatory and immune responses. This gene's involvement includes a range of conditions such as asthma, cancer, ischemia, and neurodegenerative diseases. The activation or inhibition of ADORA3 affects numerous signaling pathways such as cyclic AMP production, Akt signaling, and MAPK signaling, contributing to cell proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation. Research also links variations in this receptor's activity to differences in disease progression and treatment response in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and cancer.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of ADORA3 focuses mainly on its role as a target for modulating immune and inflammatory responses. Compounds that specifically target ADORA3, like the selective agonists IB-MECA and Cl-IB-MECA, have shown potential in treating conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, ischemic injury, and possibly some cancers by exploiting the receptor’s anti-inflammatory properties. Given the receptor’s expression in various tissues and its involvement in significant signaling pathways, ADORA3 represents an important pharmacological target. Understanding genetic variations in ADORA3 could enhance the efficacy and safety profiles of these targeting drugs by tailoring treatments based on individual genetic backgrounds. This personalized approach helps in optimizing therapy outcomes and minimizing adverse effects in patients undergoing treatments involving ADORA3-targeted medications.
