## Gene Summary
TENT4A, also known as terminal nucleotidyltransferase 4A, is a gene involved in polyadenylation and regulation of mRNA stability. TENT4A functions prominently in the addition of non-templated nucleotides to the 3' ends of RNA molecules, a process critical for the maturation and stability of messenger RNAs. This protein acts across various RNA species, influencing their degradation or processing. Its expression is widespread but may vary between different tissues, affecting diverse physiological processes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
TENT4A has been linked to several cellular pathways central to RNA metabolism and has implications in diseases related to RNA dysregulation. Although direct associations with specific diseases are still under exploration, dysregulation of RNA processing and stability can contribute to conditions like cancer and neurological disorders. The gene's role in RNA stability also connects it to the regulation of gene expression under stress conditions and during developmental processes, influencing cellular response and phenotype expression.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there are limited direct pharmacogenetic associations involving TENT4A. The geneâ€™s role in RNA stability and processing might influence the efficacy and metabolism of drugs that act on gene expression or are RNA-targeted. However, specific drugs directly influenced by TENT4A variations have not been extensively documented. As research progresses, understanding how TENT4A impacts drug response at the RNA level could reveal significant pharmacogenetic applications, especially in the context of treatments aimed at controlling gene expression or targeting RNA in diseases.
