## Gene Summary
UGT1A5, or UDP Glucuronosyltransferase Family 1 Member A5, is part of the UGT1 gene complex which encodes several isoforms with glucuronidation activity. Glucuronidation is a significant biochemical pathway for the detoxification and elimination of lipophilic endogenous and exogenous compounds. The enzyme encoded by UGT1A5 is expressed primarily in the liver and intestines and is involved in the metabolism of a wide range of substrates including bilirubin, hormones, and various pharmaceuticals. Each isoform results from a unique exon 1 being spliced to a common set of exons 2-5, a process which is differently regulated for each isoform.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
UGT1A5 participates in the glucuronidation process, making drugs and other substances more water-soluble and thus easier for the body to eliminate. This gene is centrally involved in the metabolic pathways affecting the pharmacokinetics of drugs such as irinotecan, a chemotherapeutic agent. Variations in the UGT1A5 gene can influence drug metabolism rates, impacting therapeutic efficacy and toxicity. The gene's expression and mutation status are under study for associations with diseases where bilirubin metabolism and detoxification mechanics are disrupted, such as in some forms of jaundice and liver disease.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, UGT1A5 is of interest primarily in the context of its role in drug metabolism. While specific pharmacogenetic associations between UGT1A5 and particular drugs are less well-characterized compared to other members of the UGT1A family (e.g., UGT1A1 and irinotecan sensitivity), the gene still plays a role in the overall glucuronidation capacity of individuals. As such, variations in UGT1A5 can potentially alter the pharmacokinetics and responses to drugs metabolized via glucuronidation, though specific drug relationships require further clinical confirmation. Researchers and clinicians monitor such genetic variations to tailor drug dosages for optimized therapeutic outcomes.
