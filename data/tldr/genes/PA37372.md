## Gene Summary
CCN4, also known as WISP1 (WNT1 inducible signaling pathway protein 1), is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the CCN family of secreted cysteine-rich regulatory proteins. The protein functions in multiple cell types and tissues, involved predominantly in cellular signaling processes. CCN4 plays a role in promoting cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration, and has been implicated in processes such as tissue repair, fibrosis, and the response to injury. Its expression is especially noted in osteoblasts, but can also be found across various other tissue types including lung and vascular endothelial cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CCN4 is associated with several key pathways and diseases, primarily related to its role in cellular growth and tissue repair. The gene is involved in the WNT signaling pathway, which is crucial for the regulation of cell growth, migration, and differentiation. CCN4 interactions within this pathway make it a significant player in skeletal, pulmonary, and cardiovascular systems. Disease associations with altered CCN4 expression include fibrosis, particularly pulmonary fibrosis, osteoarthritis, and certain cancers such as breast cancer and glioblastoma. It has been observed that aberrant expression of CCN4 can contribute to disease progression, linking to its role in pathological tissue remodeling and cancer metastasis.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the field of pharmacogenetics, the gene CCN4 itself does not have well-documented associations with specific drug responses or variability in drug metabolism. However, its role in cancer and fibrosis suggests that modulation of CCN4 activity or expression could potentially be a therapeutic target. For instance, in cancer therapy, targeting CCN4-mediated pathways could influence tumor growth and metastasis. In the context of fibrosis, drugs that could inhibit CCN4 expression or disrupt its signaling could mitigate fibrotic processes, particularly in diseases like pulmonary fibrosis. Research into CCN4 as a pharmacogenetic target is still emerging, with ongoing studies exploring how modulation of this gene could enhance therapeutic efficacy and personalization of treatments in diseases associated with its expression profile and signaling activities.
