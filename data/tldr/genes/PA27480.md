## Gene Summary
DRD4, or Dopamine Receptor D4, is a G protein-coupled receptor encoded by the DRD4 gene. This receptor is a member of the dopamine receptor D2-like family and is important in modulating dopamine, a neurotransmitter crucial for processes such as cognition, learning, and motivation. DRD4 is distinctive for its role in the brain, particularly in the prefrontal cortex where it influences executive functions such as attention regulation, impulse control, and risk-taking behavior. The gene features a variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in its coding sequence, which has been linked to variations in receptor efficacy and binding affinity.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The DRD4 receptor interacts with various antipsychotic and antidepressant medications. Defective functioning or altered expression of this receptor has been implicated in several psychiatric and neurological conditions. Specifically, variations in DRD4 have been associated with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, and addiction. Furthermore, the VNTR polymorphism in the DRD4 gene has been connected with novelty-seeking behavior and susceptibility to various psychological traits and disorders. In terms of pathways, DRD4 primarily influences dopaminergic signaling pathways that regulate neurotransmission, neuronal growth, and synaptic plasticity.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, DRD4 has noticeable implications, particularly concerning responses to antipsychotic drugs used in the treatment of conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Notably, the effectiveness of medications such as clozapine and olanzapine appears to be influenced by variations in the DRD4 gene, specifically the VNTR polymorphisms. Individuals carrying certain variants of the DRD4 gene may show different clinical responses or varying side effect profiles to these medications. This information can be pivotal for personalized medicine approaches in psychiatry, allowing for more tailored treatment strategies based on genetic makeup.
