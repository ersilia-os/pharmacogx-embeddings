## Gene Summary
ALDH6A1, or aldehyde dehydrogenase 6 family member A1, is an enzyme that is primarily involved in the metabolism of methylmalonate-semialdehyde, converting it into acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA. This metabolic pathway is crucial for the degradation of certain amino acids, including valine, leucine, and isoleucine. ALDH6A1 is a mitochondrial enzyme, illustrating its role in central metabolic processes within the cell. The expression of ALDH6A1 is widespread but shows higher levels in the liver and kidneys, where amino acid metabolism is particularly active.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ALDH6A1 is linked to several metabolic pathways, including amino acid degradation and the processing of various aldehydes. Disruptions or deficiencies in this enzyme are associated with metabolic disorders, specifically conditions involving the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids. While not extensively linked to many common diseases, mutations or dysregulation of ALDH6A1 could potentially result in metabolic abnormalities, and more research could uncover further associations with disease states. Its role in metabolic pathways suggests that ALDH6A1's proper functioning is crucial for cellular energy homeostasis and the processing of dietary nutrients.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of ALDH6A1 is not extensively documented compared to other members of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family. However, understanding its activity could be significant in contexts where altered metabolism of branched-chain amino acids influences drug processing or toxicity. No direct associations with specific drugs have been robustly established, but variations in ALDH6A1 activity might impact drug metabolism indirectly due to its role in general metabolic capacity. Future studies might identify more direct pharmacogenetic interactions involving drugs that are metabolized through pathways dependent on acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA levels, influenced by ALDH6A1 activity.
