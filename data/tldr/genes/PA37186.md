## Gene Summary
UGT2B10 (UDP Glucuronosyltransferase Family 2 Member B10) is part of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzyme family, crucial for the glucuronidation pathway that metabolizes drugs and endogenous compounds. This enzyme is mainly expressed in the liver and aids in the detoxification and elimination of various xenobiotics and endogenous substances. It catalyzes the conjugation of glucuronic acid to small lipophilic molecules, thereby enhancing their solubility for excretion in the urine or bile.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
UGT2B10 is involved in the metabolism of a broad range of drugs and endogenous steroids. Alterations in the enzyme's activity due to genetic variation can result in diverse phenotypes affecting drug pharmacokinetics and toxicity. This gene is studied for its role in certain diseases, particularly those related to the accumulation of toxic substances that are typically cleared by UGT-mediated glucuronidation. UGT2B10 is also involved in significant metabolic pathways, including the glucuronidation pathway, which is crucial for metabolizing both phase I metabolites from cytochrome P450 enzymes and various other compounds.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, UGT2B10 has notable interactions with several medications attributing to variation in its metabolic capacity. For example, its activity impacts the metabolism and efficacy of drugs such as nicotine, where altered metabolism can affect smoking cessation strategies and nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Differences in UGT2B10 activity can influence the duration and intensity of action for certain opioids that undergo glucuronidation, such as codeine and tramadol. Additionally, it plays a role in the metabolism of antidepressants like trazodone and diazepam, determining their clearance and potential drug interactions. Variants in UGT2B10 gene have been linked to variability in response to these medications, affecting both efficacy and the risk of adverse effects.
