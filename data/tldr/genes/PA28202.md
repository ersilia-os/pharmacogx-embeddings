## Gene Summary
FNTB, or farnesyltransferase subunit beta, is one of the two subunits that comprise the protein farnesyltransferase. This enzyme is crucial for the post-translational modification of proteins through a process called farnesylation, where a farnesyl group is added to cysteine residues on target proteins. This modification is essential for the proper functioning of many proteins involved in signal transduction, including members of the Ras superfamily. FNTB is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, indicating its general importance across different cellular functions.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
FNTB plays a significant role in several biological pathways associated with cell growth, signaling, and cancer progression, particularly due to its involvement in the modification of Ras proteins. The dysfunction or altered activity of FNTB has been linked with the development of multiple cancers, as aberrant protein farnesylation can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation. In terms of phenotype, changes in the expression or function of FNTB might also influence cellular aging and response to cellular stresses, making it a gene of interest for studies on aging and age-related diseases.

## Pharmacogenetics
From a pharmacogenetic viewpoint, the role of FNTB is particularly relevant in the context of anticancer drugs that target the farnesyltransferase enzyme. Compounds such as tipifarnib and lonafarnib are farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) designed to block the enzymatic activity involving FNTB, thereby preventing the proper functioning of oncogenic proteins like Ras. The effectiveness and toxicity of these drugs can potentially be influenced by genetic variations in the FNTB gene. Understanding these associations is crucial for optimizing therapeutic strategies against cancers where Ras signaling is a key pathological component.
