## Gene Summary
FAM178B, or Family with Sequence Similarity 178 Member B, is a gene encoded in humans on chromosome 10q21.2. The function of FAM178B is not completely characterized, but it is understood to be involved in protein-protein interactions possibly relevant to immune response modulation. The gene is expressed in numerous tissues, with notable expression in immune-related organs, implying its potential role in immune system processes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Details on the specific drugs and diseases closely associated with FAM178B are limited due to the gene's relatively uncharacterized function. However, given its potential involvement in immune system modulation, it could influence conditions characterized by immune dysfunction. The gene might operate within immune-related pathways, although more detailed studies are needed to elucidate these interactions accurately. Its dysregulation could potentially contribute to phenotypic outcomes related to immune dysfunction or autoimmunity.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there are no well-documented pharmacogenetics associations directly linking FAM178B to specific drugs or treatment outcomes. This aspect remains largely unexplored due to the gene's poorly understood role. As research progresses, there may be discoveries regarding its influence on drug efficacy or safety, potentially opening new avenues for personalized medicine in contexts related to immune regulation and autoimmunity.
