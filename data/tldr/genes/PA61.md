## Gene Summary
ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated) is a gene that encodes a protein critical for the cell cycle control and DNA repair processes. The ATM protein is a serine/threonine kinase that gets activated in response to DNA damage, particularly double-strand breaks (DSBs). Upon activation, ATM phosphorylates several key proteins that initiate DNA damage checkpoint activation, leading to cell cycle arrest and DNA repair or, in cases of irreparable damage, to apoptosis. ATM is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, with high expression in testes, thymus, and spleen, reflecting its crucial role in both the immune and reproductive systems.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The dysfunction or mutation of ATM is primarily associated with Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T), a rare genetic disorder characterized by cerebellar degeneration, telangiectasia, immune deficiencies, and a predisposition to cancer. Individuals with this disorder exhibit symptoms related to the nervous and immune systems and have an increased risk of developing various types of cancers, particularly leukemias and lymphomas. ATM is involved in several pivotal signaling pathways, including those related to p53 signaling, apoptosis, and the cell cycle, highlighting its role in maintaining genomic stability. The gene's importance in DNA repair also implicates it in responses to oxidative stress and aging.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of ATM involves its role in modulating responses to various chemotherapeutic agents, especially those that induce DNA damage. ATM's function can influence the effectiveness and toxicity of radiation therapy and drugs such as doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide, which are used in cancer treatment. For example, alterations in ATM function can affect the sensitivity and resistance to these therapies, thereby impacting therapeutic outcomes and side-effect profiles. Variants in ATM have also been studied for their association with different therapeutic responses and adverse drug reactions in cancer therapies. This pharmacogenetic information could potentially guide personalized treatment strategies in oncology, adjusting doses or treatment regimens based on a patientâ€™s ATM status to optimize efficacy and minimize toxicity.
