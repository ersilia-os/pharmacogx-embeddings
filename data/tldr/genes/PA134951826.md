## Gene Summary
HCP5 (HLA Complex P5) is a gene located within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6. Although initially thought to be involved primarily in the immune response, HCP5 is actually a noncoding RNA gene hypothesized to play roles in the regulation of immune system processes. HCP5 is predominantly found in immune cells and is most notably expressed in high levels within the context of infections. The function of HCP5 appears to be linked to the regulation of genes associated with the immune response as well as antiviral activities.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
HCP5 has been studied in the context of multiple diseases, particularly those with a significant immune component. It is notably associated with susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and its progression to AIDS. The gene has also been linked to autoimmune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis. These associations are believed to be through its link with the HLA-B gene, particularly the HLA-B*5701 allele, which is influenced by the presence of HCP5. The geneâ€™s role in immune pathways, inflammation, and its interactions with viral elements are key areas of ongoing research.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, HCP5 has gained attention primarily due to its association with the response to antiretroviral drugs in HIV treatment. Particularly, the HCP5 rs2395029 polymorphism, linked to the expression of the HLA-B*5701 allele, has been found to correlate with hypersensitivity reactions to the antiretroviral drug abacavir. This hypersensitivity is a critical factor in the clinical management of HIV, as genetic testing for HLA-B*5701 has become a routine part of the treatment planning process to prevent severe adverse reactions. Therefore, HCP5 serves as an important genetic marker in predicting patient response to abacavir, demonstrating the importance of genetic background in the personalization of medical treatments.
