## Gene Summary
ADA (Adenosine Deaminase) is a critical enzyme involved in purine metabolism, primarily responsible for the deamination of adenosine to inosine and deoxyadenosine to deoxyinosine. This reaction plays a crucial role in the breakdown and hence the regulation of adenosine and deoxyadenosine levels in tissues. ADA is expressed ubiquitously, with significant expression in the lymphoid tissues and the gastrointestinal tract. Its activity is essential for the proliferation and maintenance of lymphocyte function, influencing immune system responses.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ADA deficiency is predominantly associated with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), characterized by a drastic reduction in both B and T lymphocytes which leads to severe immunodeficiency and vulnerability to infectious diseases. The enzymatic activity of ADA is also pertinent to some cancers, autoimmune disorders, and pulmonary diseases due to its role in cellular metabolism and apoptosis. ADA is involved in multiple biochemical pathways including purine metabolism, adenosine salvage, and the methionine salvage pathway. This enzymeâ€™s function impacts crucial cellular processes like DNA synthesis and repair, and therefore, its anomalies can have profound pathological effects.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of ADA primarily focus on the implications of its deficiency and the therapeutic strategies to manage ADA-linked SCID. Pegademase bovine (Adagen) is a modified bovine form of adenosine deaminase used as enzyme replacement therapy in ADA-SCID patients. This treatment has significantly improved survival and quality of life by reducing infections and mitigating metabolic abnormalities caused by ADA deficiency. Genetic variations influencing ADA activity can also affect the efficacy and toxicity of drugs that interact with purine metabolism, such as azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine. Understanding ADA genetic mutations is also crucial for optimization of gene therapy approaches, which have been used increasingly for treating ADA-SCID, providing a functional gene copy to correct the genetic deficiency.
