## Gene Summary
EF-hand domain family member 3A (EFR3A) is involved in protein-lipid complex assembly and plays a key role in cell communication processes. It is broadly expressed in tissues such as the brain, heart, kidney, and liver. The gene functions primarily in the regulation and mediation of signal transduction pathways and has been associated with the anchoring or stabilization of specific proteins at the plasma membrane. EFR3A is particularly crucial for the recruitment and activity of lipid-modifying enzymes such as phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4K), which is essential for phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate synthesis in plasma membranes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
While specific drugs targeting EFR3A are not widely documented, the gene's involvement in lipid signaling pathways suggests potential implications in conditions related to metabolic processes. EFR3Aâ€™s role in phosphatidylinositol signaling impacts various cellular functions which may relate to metabolic syndromes, neurological disorders, and potentially cancer. Perturbations in its activity could affect numerous signal transduction pathways critical for cell growth, differentiation, and survival. Research has indicated connections with neurological pathways, making it a potential target for studying neurodevelopmental disorders.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there are no well-established pharmacogenetic associations involving EFR3A that impact drug responses in clinical settings. However, its role in crucial signaling pathways suggests that future pharmacogenetic studies might explore how variations in this gene affect responses to drugs targeting lipid signaling or related metabolic pathways. Understanding genetic variations in EFR3A could lead to insights into individual differences in drug efficacy and safety, particularly in treatments related to neurological conditions or metabolic disorders. Further research is needed to elucidate the pharmacogenetic potential of EFR3A.
