## Gene Summary
POLG, or DNA polymerase gamma, catalytic subunit, encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase gamma which is the only DNA polymerase responsible for mitochondrial DNA replication. It plays an essential role in the replication and repair of mitochondrial DNA, and due to this key role, mutations in POLG can affect mitochondrial functionality broadly. POLG is expressed in various tissues but predominantly found in those with high energy demands such as the brain, heart, and muscles.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in POLG are associated with multiple mitochondrial diseases, commonly manifesting as neurological and muscular pathologies due to mitochondrial dysfunction. These diseases include Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome, autosomal recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia, and Leigh syndrome among others, which vary widely in presentation from neurological deterioration to myopathies and liver disease. In terms of pathways, POLG is integral in mitochondrial DNA replication pathways, playing a pivotal role in maintaining mitochondrial genome integrity.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic implications of POLG predominantly pertain to the treatment responses in diseases caused by its mutations. Valproate, an antiepileptic drug, is contraindicated in patients with POLG-related disorders due to an elevated risk of acute liver failure, particularly in children under two years old. Understanding POLG genotype is crucial when considering valproate for seizure management to avoid potential life-threatening liver toxicity. There is ongoing research into how variations in POLG might impact efficacy and safety of other drugs that influence mitochondrial function, although concrete pharmacogenetic guidelines outside of valproate-related contraindications are still under development.
