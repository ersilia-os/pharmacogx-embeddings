## Gene Summary
RAC2 is the official symbol for Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 2, a member of the Rho family of GTPases. These proteins are involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, and consequently, they influence various cellular functions including cell growth, migration, and immune cell function. RAC2 is primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells and plays a particularly critical role in the signaling pathways that control the activation, differentiation, and effector functions of these cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
RAC2 has been implicated in several immune and hematological conditions due to its fundamental role in leukocyte function. Mutations in RAC2 have been associated with immunodeficiency disorders, characterized by a defective immune response. In particular, RAC2 mutations can lead to neutrophil and macrophage dysfunction, which are critical for effective innate immune responses. The gene participates in important signaling pathways such as NADPH oxidase activation, a key pathway in the respiratory burst in phagocytic cells, which is essential for the destruction of pathogens.

## Pharmacogenetics
Research in pharmacogenetics involving RAC2 is limited but growing, focusing on how variations in this gene affect responses to drugs, particularly those used in the treatment of immune-related conditions. Given RAC2â€™s role in modulating immune cell functions, pharmacogenetic studies could potentially impact the therapeutic strategies for immune deficiencies and autoimmune diseases. At this time, specific drug associations in a pharmacogenetic context are not extensively documented, which presents an area for future research in targeted therapies, especially in the context of modulating immune responses.
