## Gene Summary
OAS1 (2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the innate immune response to viral infections. The protein encoded by this gene is involved in the synthesis of 2'-5'-oligoadenylates (2-5As), which activate RNase L, leading to the degradation of viral RNA. This pathway is part of the interferon-induced antiviral defense mechanism. OAS1 is expressed in a variety of tissues, but its expression is significantly upregulated in response to interferon stimulation as part of the host's immune response to viral infection.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
OAS1 has been implicated in a range of infectious diseases, particularly those caused by viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and West Nile virus. The gene has also been associated with autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis. Moreover, genetic variations in OAS1 have been linked to differential susceptibility to various viral infections and differences in disease severity. In terms of pathways, OAS1 is a critical component of the interferon signaling pathway, specifically involved in interferon-induced antiviral actions.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, OAS1 has been researched primarily for its influence on the efficacy of interferon-based therapies, especially in the context of viral infections like hepatitis C. Variations in the OAS1 gene can affect treatment outcomes with interferon-alpha, a commonly used therapy in chronic HCV infection. For instance, certain polymorphisms in the OAS1 gene are associated with a better response to interferon therapy, potentially influencing dosing and overall treatment strategy. Understanding these genetic variations allows for a more personalized approach in treating viral infections, enhancing the efficacy and reducing the side effects of interferon-based therapies.
