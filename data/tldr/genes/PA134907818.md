## Gene Summary
The gene NUBPL (Nucleotide Binding Protein-Like) encodes a protein involved in the assembly of mitochondrial complex I, which is the largest of the five complexes in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This complex plays a critical role in the oxidative phosphorylation system, converting energy stored in nutrients into ATP, the main energy currency of the cell. Mutations in this gene have been linked to mitochondrial complex I deficiency, a condition that can influence cellular energy metabolism significantly.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NUBPL has been associated with a mitochondrial complex I deficiency subtype known as "Mitochondrial complex I deficiency, nuclear type 13." This deficiency can result in a wide range of clinical manifestations, from lethal neonatal disease to adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders. The symptoms may involve muscle weakness, neurodevelopmental delays, and various organ system dysfunctions. It is involved primarily in the mitochondrial respiratory chain pathway, playing a pivotal role in bioenergetics and cellular metabolism.

## Pharmacogenetics
As of the current knowledge, pharmacogenetic associations of NUBPL with specific drugs have not been well established. The research primarily focuses on understanding the gene's role in mitochondrial function and dysfunction, rather than its interactions with pharmaceutical agents. However, therapies that target mitochondrial dysfunction could theoretically be influenced by mutations in NUBPL, suggesting a potential area for future pharmacogenetic investigation, particularly in the development of treatments for mitochondrial disorders.
