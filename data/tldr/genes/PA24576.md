## Gene Summary
ADH6, or Alcohol Dehydrogenase 6 (Class V), is a member of the alcohol dehydrogenase family, which plays a key role in metabolizing alcohols in the body to aldehydes and ketones. ADH6 is primarily expressed in the liver and functions in the metabolism of a variety of substances including ethanol, retinol, and other volatile and non-volatile alcohols through its enzymatic activity. The enzyme encoded by ADH6 is less well characterized than other members of the alcohol dehydrogenase family but has been shown to have a high activity for ethanol oxidation, although it generally exhibits a lower affinity for alcohols compared to other alcohol dehydrogenases.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ADH6 is implicated mostly in pathways involved with ethanol toxicity and the metabolic processing of alcohols. Through its enzymatic action in alcohol metabolism, ADH6 influences acetaldehyde levels, which if accumulated, can lead to cytotoxicity and eventually diseases such as alcoholic liver disease. The enzyme might also participate indirectly in conditions related to oxidative stress and inflammation triggered by aldehyde byproducts. Genetic variations within ADH6 can impact susceptibility to alcoholism and the severity of alcohol withdrawal symptoms due to the individual variations in alcohol metabolism efficiency.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, specific pharmacogenetic associations of ADH6 with drugs are not as well characterized as those for other alcohol dehydrogenase genes like ADH1B or ADH1C. However, understanding its role in the metabolism of ethanol and other alcohols can be predictive of general responses to alcohol consumption. Variants in ADH6 could contribute to interindividual differences in alcohol pharmacokinetics and responses, potentially influencing the risk for dependence and the effectiveness of treatments for alcohol-related disorders. Awareness of these differences may guide clinicians in personalizing treatments although specific drug interactions and direct associations remain to be fully elucidated.
