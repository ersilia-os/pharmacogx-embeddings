I currently do not have detailed information on a gene specifically named "LRMDA". There could potentially be a typographical error or discrepancy in the gene symbol you provided. Gene symbols are typically standardized and it is vital to use the correct nomenclature to ensure accurate identification and discussion of the gene in question.

If possible, please verify the gene symbol or provide additional context such as a full gene name or associated functions and diseases. This would aid in delivering an accurate summary about the gene of interest. If "LRMDA" was intended to refer to a known gene but was misspelled, clarification would be necessary to offer precise information.
