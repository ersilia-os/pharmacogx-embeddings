## Gene Summary
AKR1D1, also known as Aldo-keto Reductase Family 1 Member D1, plays a critical role in human steroid metabolism. It is involved in the catabolism of steroids, functioning primarily to reduce Δ4-3-ketosteroid to the corresponding 5α-steroid. AKR1D1 is expressed in the liver and intestine predominantly, with its expression facilitating the control of steroid hormone availability. This can influence various metabolic processes and hormone signaling pathways.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
AKR1D1 is implicated in various metabolic disorders and hormonal imbalances. The enzyme's function impacts key pathways, including cortisol and bile acid metabolism, which are vital for maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Disruptions in AKR1D1 activity can contribute to disorders like steroid-resistant asthma due to dysregulation of glucocorticoid metabolism as well as chronic liver diseases via alterations in bile acid synthesis. Additionally, abnormal function of this gene has been associated with a susceptibility to bile acid synthesis and metabolism disorders, emphasizing its role in disease phenotypes.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of AKR1D1 primarily involves its role in modulating steroid hormone levels, influencing the efficacy and metabolism of steroid-based therapies, such as corticosteroids used in asthma, arthritis, and other inflammatory diseases. Variants in AKR1D1 can affect drug response, notably influencing the therapeutic outcomes in treatments involving glucocorticoids. Understanding these genetic variations is crucial for adjusting drug doses and developing personalized treatment plans to improve drug efficacy and minimize adverse effects.
