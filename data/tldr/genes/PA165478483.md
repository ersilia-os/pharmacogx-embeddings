## Gene Summary
HYKK (hydroxylysine kinase) is a gene that encodes the enzyme hydroxylysine kinase, which is involved in the catabolism of hydroxylysine, an amino acid derivative found in collagen. This enzyme facilitates the phosphorylation of hydroxylysine to form 5-phosphonohydroxy-L-lysine, a crucial step in the amino acid degradation pathway. The HYKK gene is mainly expressed in the liver, kidney, and testis, suggesting a tissue-specific role in these areas.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
HYKK is not prominently known for its direct relationships with major drugs or diseases. However, its role in amino acid metabolism links it to metabolic pathways that could influence broader metabolic conditions and nutrient processing. Mutations or deficiencies in the HYKK gene and enzyme could theoretically lead to abnormal collagen metabolism, although specific disorders directly attributed to HYKK mutations are not well-characterized in the current scientific literature.

## Pharmacogenetics
As of the current state of knowledge, HYKK has not been directly associated with pharmacogenetic interactions affecting drug response significantly. The gene's function in amino acid metabolism might imply potential interactions with nutraceuticals or treatments targeting metabolic pathways, but these possibilities have not been extensively validated or documented in clinical pharmacogenetics research. Future studies might expand on its role, revealing any significant pharmacogenetic implications.
