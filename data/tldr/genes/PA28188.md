## Gene Summary
FMO4, or Flavin Containing Monooxygenase 4, is part of the flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) enzyme family. These enzymes are involved in the oxidative metabolism of various xenobiotics and drugs, utilizing a wide spectrum of nitrogen-, sulfur-, and phosphorus-containing compounds. Unlike its closely related counterparts like FMO1 and FMO3, which are predominantly expressed in liver tissues, FMO4 has a more diverse expression profile including the liver but also other tissues such as the brain and kidney.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
FMO4's role in drug metabolism is less characterized compared to FMO3. However, research indicates that FMO4 might participate in the metabolic pathways involving certain drugs, albeit with a possibly lesser extent or different specificity. Being part of a gene family known for processing xenobiotics, mutations or variations in FMO4 could potentially influence drug responses or toxicity. Diseases and phenotypes associated with FMO4 are not as well-documented, indicating a need for further investigation to elucidate its precise biological roles and impacts.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic studies involving FMO4 are relatively limited, with more focus traditionally placed on FMO3 due to its prominent role in drug metabolism, particularly in the metabolism of drugs like clozapine and tamoxifen. While direct, well-documented associations between FMO4 variants and specific drug interactions or adverse reactions are lacking, understanding FMO4's pharmacogenetic profile could be crucial for drugs metabolized by FMO enzymes collectively. Future research may reveal more about how variations in FMO4 affect drug efficacy and safety, which could be significant for personalized medicine approaches involving drugs metabolized by the FMO family.
