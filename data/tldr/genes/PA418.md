## Gene Summary
UPB1, the official symbol for ureidopropionase, beta, is a metabolic enzyme primarily involved in the catabolism of pyrimidines. It catalyzes the conversion of N-carbamyl-beta-amino acids into the corresponding beta-amino acids and carbon dioxide, a crucial step in the degradation of pyrimidine nucleotides to beta-alanine, which can be further converted into malonic semialdehyde. The UPB1 gene is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues, with higher expression levels observed in liver and kidney, where pyrimidine breakdown predominantly occurs.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The primary association of UPB1 function is with beta-ureidopropionase deficiency, a rare inborn metabolic disorder. This autosomal recessive condition involves an inability to properly metabolize uracil and thymine, leading to a buildup of toxic intermediates which can manifest clinically as neurological abnormalities including seizure, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. The biochemical pathway involving UPB1 includes the pyrimidine catabolic pathway, crucial for nucleic acid turnover and nitrogen balance in the body.

## Pharmacogenetics
While UPB1’s implications in pharmacogenetics have not been as well-characterized as some pharmacogenes, the enzyme’s role in metabolizing pyrimidine analogues suggests potential relevance to treatments involving these compounds. Pyrimidine analogues such as 5-fluorouracil and capecitabine, used in chemotherapy, could potentially be influenced by UPB1 activity. Furthermore, understanding the variations in UPB1 might elucidate individual differences in drug metabolism and toxicity, particularly relevant to chemotherapeutic management. Yet, direct pharmacogenetic associations between UPB1 variations and drug responses or adverse effects remain underexplored, suggesting an area for future investigational research.
