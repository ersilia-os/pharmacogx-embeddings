## Gene Summary
METAP1, or Methionyl Aminopeptidase 1, is an enzyme encoded by the METAP1 gene in humans. This gene is involved in processing newly synthesized proteins. METAP1 specifically removes the N-terminal methionine from nascent proteins, a crucial step in protein maturation and function. The activity of this aminopeptidase is essential for normal cellular function, and it is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, with significant levels in the liver and kidney.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
METAP1 plays a role in several cellular pathways, including protein synthesis and modification processes. The disruptions or alterations in METAP1 function have been linked to various cellular dysfunctions, although direct associations with specific diseases are yet understudied. However, given its fundamental role in protein maturation, abnormalities in METAP1 expression or function could potentially contribute to diseases characterized by aberrant protein processing or metabolic disorders. The gene's involvement in essential cellular processes signifies its potential impact on general metabolic phenotypes.

## Pharmacogenetics
While the pharmacogenetics of METAP1 is not as extensively characterized as some other genes, its fundamental role in protein processing suggests that it might influence the efficacy and toxicity of drugs that rely on protein binding or are involved in pathways requiring precise protein modification. However, specific drugs directly associated with METAP1 in a pharmacogenetic context have yet to be distinctly identified. Ongoing research may illuminate more about how variations in this gene affect drug response, potentially guiding more personalized approaches in therapies involving protein-targeting drugs.
