## Gene Summary
INSRR, also known as the insulin receptor-related receptor, is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family, closely related to the insulin receptor (INSR) and the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R). This gene is primarily expressed in various tissues including kidney, pancreas, and brain. INSRR is believed to play a role in the cellular signal transduction mediated by ligands that are yet to be fully characterized. INSRR activation influences metabolic pathways that are distinct yet potentially overlapping with the classical insulin signaling pathways.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The role of INSRR in specific diseases is not very well characterized compared to INSR or IGF1R. However, its structural and functional similarity to these receptors suggests potential implications in metabolic disorders or conditions involving abnormal cellular growth and differentiation. Additionally, given its expression profile, INSRR may have implications in organ-specific functions and diseases, particularly affecting the kidneys and neural tissues. Pathway analyses generally tie INSRR to the broader realms of growth factor receptor signaling pathways, with potential effects on cellular growth, division, and metabolic regulation.

## Pharmacogenetics
Specific pharmacogenetic associations of INSRR are currently limited, partly due to its less-characterized nature and partly due to the lack of identified physiological ligands. Unlike INSR, which has direct clinical implications in diabetes management via insulin and other insulin-sensitizing drugs, INSRR does not have similarly direct associations with pharmacological agents in clinical use. Research continues to explore its broader implications and potential as a therapeutic target, which might clarify pharmacogenetic relationships in future studies. Given its biological kinship with insulin and IGF receptors, it's conceivable that future findings might uncover connections to metabolic or growth-related therapies.
