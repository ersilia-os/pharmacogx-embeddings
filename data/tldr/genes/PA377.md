## Gene Summary
CES2 (Carboxylesterase 2) is an enzyme encoded by the human CES2 gene and is predominantly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the liver and small intestine. This enzyme belongs to a family of carboxylesterases that play a crucial role in the hydrolysis of ester- and amide-containing xenobiotics and endogenous substrates. CES2 is involved in the metabolic processing of a wide range of clinical drugs, often responsible for drug activation or inactivation. It also facilitates the metabolism of dietary fats and cholesterol esters, thus impacting lipid digestion and absorption.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The CES2 enzyme is integral in medical pharmacotherapy and toxicology due to its role in drug metabolism. It is involved in the metabolic pathways affecting the action and toxicity of several classes of drugs, including prodrug activations. Abnormalities or variations in the expression and function of CES2 have been implicated in various drug responses and interactions. The enzyme's activity can influence the effectiveness and toxicity profiles of certain medications, impacting therapeutic outcomes. Mutation or altered regulation of this gene might be involved in gastrointestinal diseases and disorders related to lipid metabolism, although specific disease associations are less directly documented compared to its pharmacological implications.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, CES2 has recognized relevance due to its influence on the bioavailability and effectiveness of several drugs. Notably, it is involved in the activation of the anticancer prodrug irinotecan (CPT-11) into its active metabolite, SN-38, which is significantly more potent in its antitumor effects. Variations in CES2 gene expression and function can lead to significant differences in irinotecan metabolism, influencing treatment efficacy and adverse event profiles in cancer therapy. Similarly, the enzyme impacts the metabolism of dabigatran etexilate, an anticoagulant, thus affecting drug levels and anticoagulant effects. Research also highlights its role in the metabolism of oseltamivir, a key anti-influenza agent, where CES2 activity can modify therapeutic outcomes during influenza treatment. Knowledge of CES2 pharmacogenetic profiles can guide dose adjustments and treatment choices across these medications, optimizing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing toxicity risks.
