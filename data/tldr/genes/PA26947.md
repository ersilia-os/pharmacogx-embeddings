## Gene Summary
CSMD1, or CUB and Sushi multiple domains 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the complement control protein superfamily. The protein features multiple complement control protein modules, also known as sushi repeats. These domains are frequently found in proteins involved in the complement system. CSMD1 is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system but can also be found in various other tissues including the heart, pancreas, and skeletal muscle. It is suggested that CSMD1 plays a role in immune response modulation and neuronal processes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CSMD1 has been implicated in a variety of biological pathways and health conditions, although direct associations with specific drugs are not well established. The gene has predominantly been studied in the context of cancer, neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Alterations and variations within CSMD1 have been associated with susceptibility to multiple types of cancer, including colorectal and brain cancers. Moreover, CSMD1 has been studied in neurological and psychiatric contexts, notably in schizophrenia and Alzheimerâ€™s disease, suggesting a role in cognitive processes and brain development.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of CSMD1 remains relatively under-explored compared to other genes more directly involved in drug metabolism or response pathways. However, its involvement in diseases like schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease highlights potential indirect interactions with treatments used in these conditions, such as antipsychotics and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors respectively. Future pharmacogenetics studies could provide deeper insights into how variations in CSMD1 influence responses to such medications, potentially leading to more personalized therapeutic strategies. Understanding its role in cancer susceptibility also opens avenues for exploring how CSMD1 variants may interact with cancer therapeutics in a pharmacogenomic context.
