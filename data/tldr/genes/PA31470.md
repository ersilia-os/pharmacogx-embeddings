## Gene Summary
NCOA1 (Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 1), also known as SRC-1 (Steroid Receptor Coactivator 1), is a vital transcriptional coactivator that interacts with nuclear hormone receptors to enhance their transcriptional activation of genes. It is widely expressed across various tissues, including reproductive organs, muscle, and adipose tissue, reflecting its broad roles in various biological processes. NCOA1 participates in hormone signaling and has been implicated in energy metabolism, reproductive functions, and cellular growth and differentiation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NCOA1 influences several pathways linked to hormonal signaling and has been associated with cancer, particularly hormone-dependent types such as breast and prostate cancer. Due to its role in enhancing estrogen receptor activity, it is critical in the context of breast cancer. In addition to cancer, alterations in NCOA1 expression or function can affect body weight regulation, and hence it plays a role in metabolic syndrome and obesity-linked disorders. NCOA1's interaction with various nuclear receptors, including ER (estrogen receptor), AR (androgen receptor), and PPARÎ³, underlies its multi-faceted role in cellular proliferation and metabolic regulation.

## Pharmacogenetics
NCOA1's pharmacogenetics primarily relates to its influence on the efficacy and behavior of hormone-related therapies. In breast cancer, its coactivation of estrogen receptors can modulate the response to estrogen modulators such as tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), used in hormone therapy for breast cancer. The effectiveness of such treatments can vary based on NCOA1 expression levels or mutations, potentially influencing clinical outcomes and necessitating personalized treatment approaches. Additionally, the role of NCOA1 in androgen receptor signaling implicates it in responses to anti-androgen therapies in prostate cancer. Understanding individual variations in the NCOA1 gene could enhance therapeutic strategies, tailoring them according to the gene's expression or mutational status.
