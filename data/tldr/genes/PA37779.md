## Gene Summary
UGT2B28, officially termed UDP Glucuronosyltransferase Family 2 Member B28, is a gene that encodes an enzyme involved in Phase II of drug metabolism, particularly in the glucuronidation of a broad spectrum of substrates, including steroids, bile acids, and xenobiotics. This enzymatic process is crucial for the detoxification and excretion of these compounds. UGT2B28 is part of the larger UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) family and is expressed in various tissues, notably the liver and kidney, which are key sites for drug metabolism.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
UGT2B28 plays a significant role in the metabolic pathways that modify and facilitate the excretion of both endogenous substances and xenobiotics. This includes the glucuronidation of hormones such as androgens and estrogens, thereby influencing hormone regulation and potentially impacting conditions like hormone-dependent cancers. Its involvement in drug metabolism also suggests a potential impact on the pharmacokinetics of various medications, although specific common drugs directly associated with UGT2B28 are less documented compared to other UGT family members. The gene's activity could also influence the risk of diseases linked to hormone imbalances.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the field of pharmacogenetics, UGT2B28 has been identified to have variations that can affect individual responses to certain drugs, although it is less studied than other UGT genes like UGT1A1 or UGT2B15. Known polymorphisms in the UGT2B28 gene may alter enzyme activity and thus influence the metabolism and effectiveness of drugs, potentially leading to variable drug responses among individuals. This variability can affect drug safety and efficacy, requiring dosage adjustments or alternative medications in personalized medicine approaches. However, more detailed and specific associations with particular drugs need further clarification through clinical studies to fully integrate UGT2B28 into pharmacogenetic testing panels commonly used in personalized medicine.
