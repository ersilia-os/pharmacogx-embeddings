## Gene Summary
MAN1B1 stands for "Mannosidase Alpha Class 1B Member 1." This gene encodes an enzyme that is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and is involved in the glycoprotein quality control process. MAN1B1 specifically catalyzes the removal of mannose residues from N-linked glycoproteins, a critical step in the maturation and eventual degradation of misfolded glycoproteins. This enzyme's function aids in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein folding.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
MAN1B1 has been implicated in a rare autosomal recessive disorder known as MAN1B1-CDG (Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation Type II). Patients with mutations in this gene exhibit developmental delay, intellectual disability, and various physical abnormalities, among other symptoms. The geneâ€™s role in glycoprotein processing situates it within several crucial biological pathways involving protein quality control and degradation via the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. The disruption of these processes in MAN1B1-CDG underlines the gene's importance in neural development and systemic physiology.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there are no direct pharmacogenetic associations involving MAN1B1 that influence drug efficacy or safety in a clinically recognized manner. Research is ongoing, however, to better understand the relationship between altered MAN1B1 function and broader implications for diseases and therapies, particularly those involving protein misfolding and degradation mechanisms. Understanding these connections might open up potential therapeutic interventions targeting these pathways, which could involve enzyme replacement therapy or drugs that modulate the ERAD pathway, particularly in diseases like MAN1B1-CDG where protein processing is defective.
