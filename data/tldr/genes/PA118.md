## Gene Summary
SLC31A1, also known as the solute carrier family 31 member 1, is a gene that encodes a high-affinity copper transport protein, CTR1. This transporter is pivotal in the cellular uptake of copper, an essential micronutrient that serves as a cofactor for a variety of enzymes involved in critical biological processes, including mitochondrial respiration and antioxidant defense. CTR1 is primarily localized in the plasma membrane and is expressed ubiquitously across various tissues, with noteworthy expression in the liver and kidney. Its expression and function are tightly regulated by cellular copper levels.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The protein encoded by SLC31A1 is involved in copper homeostasis and is linked to several diseases where copper metabolism is disrupted, such as Menkes disease and Wilson disease, although these primarily involve other specific copper transporters or handling proteins. The alteration in copper transport via SLC31A1 can influence the pathology of these diseases indirectly. Moreover, pathways including SLC31A1 are integral to the understanding of copperâ€™s role in neurological diseases and cancers, where it can influence angiogenesis and metastasis. The gene also interacts with various essential signaling pathways, influencing cell growth and apoptosis.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of SLC31A1 is particularly significant in the context of cancer therapy, as CTR1 mediates the cellular uptake of platinum-based drugs such as cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin, which are commonly used chemotherapeutic agents. Variants in SLC31A1 can affect the efficiency of drug uptake, and subsequently, the therapeutic outcome and toxicity profile in cancer treatment. Studies have shown that polymorphisms in SLC31A1 may be linked with differing patient responses to platinum therapy, potentially influencing survival rates and adverse effects. Therefore, understanding the genetic variants of SLC31A1 can have direct implications for the personalization of chemotherapy strategies and tailoring treatments to improve efficacy and reduce toxicity in patients treated with these drugs.
