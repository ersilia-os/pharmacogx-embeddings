## Gene Summary
ATP10A, or ATPase phospholipid transporting 10A (putative), is a gene that encodes a member of the P4-ATPase family, which functions primarily as flippases helping in the translocation of phospholipids from the outer to the inner leaflets of various biological membranes. Its specific roles in cellular processes are somewhat less defined compared to other P4-ATPases but involve membrane lipid asymmetry maintenance essential for vesicle formation and membrane trafficking. ATP10A is mainly expressed in the brain and likely plays a role in neurological processes. It is an imprinted gene, predominantly expressed from the maternal allele, with an important implication in genomic imprinting disorders.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ATP10A has not been as extensively studied as some other genes in terms of its associations with specific drugs and diseases. However, it has been implicated in a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD), Angelman syndrome, and potentially Prader-Willi syndrome. These associations are generally due to its location within a chromosomal region (15q11-q13) known for these imprinting disorders. The gene's role in membrane trafficking and composition also suggests it could influence various cellular pathways like cell signaling, vesicle-mediated transport, and possibly neurotransmitter release mechanisms.

## Pharmacogenetics
While specific pharmacogenetic associations of ATP10A with particular drugs are not well-defined, its potential impact on neurological function hints at broader implications in the efficacy and metabolism of drugs used to treat neurological disorders such as antipsychotics and mood stabilizers. Furthermore, given its role in vesicle formation and membrane lipid configuration, drugs targeting cellular transport processes might indirectly be influenced by the function of ATP10A. The geneâ€™s expression and potential regulation could be influenced by epigenetic factors with subsequent indirect effects on drug action. Its genomic location also suggests possible interplay with other genes in the region that are important in pharmacogenetics, hence influencing drug response in complex, indirect ways.
