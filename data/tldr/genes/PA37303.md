## Gene Summary
VEGFB (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor B) is a key protein in the family of vascular endothelial growth factors, primarily involved in the regulation of blood vessel formation and maintenance. VEGFB functions predominantly in the cardiovascular system by promoting the survival of endothelial cells and enhancing the supply of nutrients to tissues through blood vessel growth and maintenance, particularly across the heart and skeletal muscles. It occupies an important role in vascular homeostasis by influencing the growth of vascular endothelial cells and metabolism, but its angiogenic potency is considered less than that of VEGFA.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
VEGFB is associated with the progression of various cardiovascular diseases, due to its essential role in maintaining endothelial function and vascular integrity. Based on its activity, disruptions or modifications to VEGFB expression and signaling can contribute to diseases such as heart disease, diabetic complications, and potentially metabolic syndrome, although direct associations may vary. The gene is involved in several signaling pathways including the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which is significant for cell survival, growth, and metabolism. Research suggests a possible connection between altered VEGFB expression and diabetes mellitus, particularly in the development of diabetic retinopathy.

## Pharmacogenetics
In terms of pharmacogenetics, VEGFB does not have as extensive a profile of drug-gene interactions as more canonical pharmacogenetic genes. However, drugs targeting the VEGF pathways, like anti-angiogenic agents used in cancer therapy, may indirectly influence VEGFB activity. For example, agents targeting VEGFA could have secondary effects on VEGFB due to their close relation and shared receptors. Further exploration in clinical settings could reveal more concrete pharmacogenetic relationships involving VEGFB, especially concerning cardiovascular and metabolic disorders where modulation of endothelial growth factors might prove beneficial.
