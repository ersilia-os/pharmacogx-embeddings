## Gene Summary
CNTN4, known as Contactin 4, is part of the contactin family, which are immunoglobulin superfamily members playing roles in the development of the nervous system. CNTN4 is involved in promoting neurite outgrowth and is critical in the formation of axonal connections in the developing nervous system. This gene is expressed predominantly in the brain, particularly in regions involved in learning and memory.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CNTN4 has been linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders. Mutations or deletions in this gene are associated with conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability. Patients with alterations in CNTN4 often show varying phenotypes, ranging from mild learning disabilities to more severe cognitive deficits. The exact pathways through which CNTN4 operates are complex and involve interactions with other cellular components critical for neural connectivity and function.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there are no direct pharmacogenetic associations involving CNTN4 that impact drug response significantly. However, understanding the genetic variations in CNTN4 can provide insights into the neurological basis of certain disorders and might influence therapeutic approaches in the future, particularly in the fields of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions. Further research into the gene could uncover potential targets for medication affecting neural connectivity and cognitive function.
