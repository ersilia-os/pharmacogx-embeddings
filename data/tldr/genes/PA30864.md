## Gene Summary
MME, also known as membrane metallo-endopeptidase, encodes the enzyme neprilysin. This zinc-dependent metalloprotease is crucial for the breakdown of bioactive peptides in the body, including the natriuretic peptides, substance P, amyloid beta peptides, and endothelin. Neprilysin is expressed in various tissues, predominantly in kidney and epithelial cells of the small intestine, contributing to the regulation of blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. There is also significant expression in the brain where it has been implicated in the degradation of amyloid-β peptide, hence its association with Alzheimer’s disease.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
MME is involved in pathways significant for cardiovascular regulation, particularly through its role in degrading natriuretic peptides which are involved in vasodilation, natriuresis, and diuresis. Its function touches upon hypertension, heart failure, and Alzheimer’s disease due to its interplay with amyloid-beta peptides in neural tissues. Neprilysin inhibitors, when used in combination with angiotensin receptor blockers, form a class of drugs used for treating heart failure. The gene's role extends to metabolic and inflammatory processes, impacting conditions such as diabetes and renal diseases.

## Pharmacogenetics
From a pharmacogenetic perspective, variations in the MME gene influence the effectiveness and response of certain cardiovascular drugs. In particular, the response to neprilysin inhibitors, used either alone or in combination therapy for heart conditions, can be affected by genetic differences. Drugs like sacubitril, part of the combination drug sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto), are influenced by MME gene variations. Tailoring treatment according to MME genotypes might enhance therapeutic efficacy and minimize adverse effects for heart failure treatment and potentially for Alzheimer's therapy, although direct associations in Alzheimer's require further confirmation through clinical studies.
