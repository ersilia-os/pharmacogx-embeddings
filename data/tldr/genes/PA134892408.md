## Gene Summary
SLCO4C1, or Solute Carrier Organic Anion Transporter Family Member 4C1, is part of the solute carrier family. This family is known for its role in the transport of a wide variety of substances across cellular membranes. SLCO4C1 specifically facilitates the sodium-independent transport of organic anions including thyroid hormones and possibly steroid conjugates and bile acids. Expression of SLCO4C1 is predominantly observed in the kidney, localized mainly to the basolateral membrane of renal tubular cells, suggesting a role in the renal excretion of endogenous and exogenous organic compounds.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SLCO4C1 is potentially involved in various physiological and pathological processes given its function in organic ion transport. There is evidence linking its activity to the handling of drugs and the bodyâ€™s hormonal regulation, particularly concerning thyroid hormones. As such, dysfunction or variations in the expression and function of SLCO4C1 could influence the pharmacokinetics of certain drugs, contribute to disorders related to improper hormone transport, and affect kidney function. While specific disease associations are less well-defined for SLCO4C1 compared to other SLCO family members, its role suggests it could contribute to renal and possibly thyroid disorders.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic implications of SLCO4C1 are still being elucidated as research into its specific substrates and interaction with drugs continues. Due to its ability to transport diverse anionic substances, variations in SLCO4C1 could affect the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of certain drugs, particularly those reliant on renal excretion. As research progresses, understanding polymorphisms within SLCO4C1 could potentially guide adjustments in drug dosing to optimize efficacy and minimize toxicity, particularly for drugs cleared predominantly by renal mechanisms. Although direct associations with particular drugs are still under study, the transporter's role suggests that it might impact the therapeutic management of conditions treated with medications that are organic anions.
