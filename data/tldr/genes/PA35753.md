## Gene Summary
SHMT1, or serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1, is a gene encoding the cytosolic form of serine hydroxymethyltransferase, an enzyme vital in the metabolism of amino acids. SHMT1 plays a key role in the conversion of serine and tetrahydrofolate (THF) to glycine and 5,10-methylene-THF, a critical reaction in the folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism pathway. This pathway is essential for DNA synthesis and repair, making SHMT1 crucial in cell proliferation and survival. The enzyme is primarily expressed in the liver and in various tumors, suggesting its involvement in both normal physiology and disease conditions.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SHMT1 is implicated in several biochemical pathways, including amino acid synthesis and the folate metabolism pathway, which are fundamental for cellular replication and DNA repair mechanisms. Aberrations in these pathways are often linked to diseases such as cancer, where altered folate metabolism can affect cell division and integrity. Specifically, SHMT1 expression has been observed in various cancer types, potentially linking it to oncogenesis. Research suggests that variations in SHMT1 expression or activity could influence disease susceptibility, particularly in those diseases where folate metabolism is disrupted.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic implications of SHMT1 primarily involve its role in modulating the efficacy and toxicity of antifolate drugs, such as methotrexate, used primarily in cancer treatment and autoimmune disorders. Methotrexate acts by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), leading to a reduced production of THF and downstream metabolites like 5,10-methylene-THF. As SHMT1 is directly involved in the regeneration of these metabolites, genetic variations in SHMT1 can significantly impact drug response. Individuals with certain SHMT1 polymorphisms might experience altered drug effectiveness or an increased risk of side effects, necessitating adjusted dosages or alternative therapies. Thus, understanding SHMT1 genetic variants is critical in optimizing methotrexate therapy for individual patients, enhancing therapeutic outcomes while minimizing adverse effects.
