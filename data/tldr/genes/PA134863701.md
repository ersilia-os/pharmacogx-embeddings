## Gene Summary
SLC39A14, also known as solute carrier family 39 member 14, is a gene involved in zinc transport and metabolism. It serves as an integral membrane protein that functions primarily as a transporter that facilitates the cellular uptake of divalent metal ions, particularly zinc and manganese. SLC39A14 is expressed in various tissues including liver, kidney, and pancreas. It plays a crucial role in regulating the homeostasis of metal ions within cells, which is essential for various biological processes such as enzyme function, signal transduction, and gene expression.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SLC39A14 is linked to several clinical conditions and biological pathways due to its role in metal ion homeostasis. Notably, it is associated with the development of Parkinsonism-dystonia, infantile (PKDYS), a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by early-onset Parkinsonism and dystonia. The disturbance in manganese transport caused by mutations in SLC39A14 leads to manganese buildup and toxicity in the brain. In terms of pathways, SLC39A14 is involved in the transport of metal ions and plays a role in the cellular response to metal ion levels, impacting processes such as cellular metal ion detoxification and the oxidative stress response.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of SLC39A14 is primarily concerned with its influence on manganese levels due to its role in metal transport. Disorders arising from mutations in SLC39A14, such as PKDYS, implicate the gene in the altered handling and toxicity of manganese in the body. While direct pharmacogenetic associations with specific drugs are not extensively documented, understanding the geneâ€™s function can guide therapeutic approaches, particularly chelation therapy in manganese toxicity scenarios. Such information is valuable for developing treatment regimens that mitigate the effects of metal ion dysregulation, although further research is required to clarify direct links between SLC39A14 genetic variability and drug response.
