## Gene Summary
ALDH3B1, or aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 family member B1, is part of the ALDH family, which plays a crucial role in the detoxification of aldehydes, the metabolism of alcohol, and the synthesis of various biologically active molecules. This enzyme is mainly expressed in the liver and is involved in oxidizing aldehydes to their corresponding carboxylic acids using NAD⁺ as a cofactor. ALDH3B1 is less studied than other members of the ALDH family but has shown potential roles in metabolic pathways that are important for cellular protection against oxidative stress and toxic aldehydes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ALDH3B1 is linked to several metabolic pathways, including the metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 and the metabolic detoxyfication of aldehydes. Although specific diseases haven't been robustly associated with mutations or dysregulation of ALDH3B1, related enzymes in the ALDH family are involved in conditions such as alcohol-induced liver disease and various types of cancer. The enzyme's role in aldehyde metabolism also suggests a possible connection to diseases characterized by the accumulation of toxic aldehyde substrates, which may implicate it in broader metabolic or degenerative disorders.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of ALDH3B1 is not as well characterized as other members of the ALDH family, like ALDH2, which has significant implications in alcohol metabolism and associated disorders. However, understanding variations within ALDH3B1 could potentially be critical for predicting responses to drugs that are modified by aldehyde dehydrogenases or drugs targeting metabolic pathways involving aldehydes. Advances in pharmacogenetics might reveal more about ALDH3B1’s impact on drug response and interactions, especially concerning detoxification pathways critical in drug metabolism and adverse drug reactions.
