## Gene Summary
ALDH9A1, short for Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 9 Family Member A1, is a gene that encodes a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase protein family. The enzyme encoded by ALDH9A1 is important in metabolizing a variety of aldehydes, including ethanol-derived acetaldehyde, and is also involved in the metabolism of gamma-aminobutyraldehyde to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). ALDH9A1 is expressed in a range of tissues, but it is particularly noted in the liver and kidneys, where detoxification processes are prominent.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The ALDH9A1 enzyme participates in several metabolic pathways, including the metabolism of amino acids and lipids. Although not as widely studied as other ALDH family members like ALDH2, research suggests that ALDH9A1 could play a role in metabolic disorders due to its involvement in aldehyde metabolism. Disruptions in these pathways are sometimes linked to diseases such as alcohol-related disorders and possibly other metabolic syndromes. However, detailed links between ALDH9A1 mutations and specific diseases or phenotypes are not as well characterized.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, the function of ALDH9A1 primarily draws attention to its role in alcohol metabolism and potential implications in drug metabolism and toxicity. While specific drugs directly associated with ALDH9A1 are not extensively documented, the enzyme's role in metabolizing toxic aldehydes produced during drug metabolism suggests its potential impact on drugs causing aldehyde-related toxicity. Further understanding of this gene may help in predicting individual responses to these drugs and alcohol, particularly in different ethnic groups known to have varying frequencies of ALDH9A1 variants. More research is required to establish firm pharmacogenetic associations.
