## Gene Summary
WBP2NL, also known as SPA17, is a gene that codes for the sperm autoantigenic protein 17. This protein is predominantly expressed in reproductive tissues and is known to play a role in sperm function and fertilization. The WBP2NL gene produces a protein with a domain that potentially interacts with other proteins that are implicated in signal transduction and intracellular communication, suggesting its involvement in critical regulatory processes in sperm cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
WBP2NL is not directly associated with common diseases or exploited in routine clinical drug targeting, as its primary role is linked with reproduction, specifically sperm motility and capacitation. However, alterations or defects in this gene could potentially be explored in the context of male infertility or reproductive dysfunctions. The pathways involving WBP2NL mostly encompass those related to reproductive cellular processes and signal transduction mechanisms necessary for successful fertilization.

## Pharmacogenetics
Research in the pharmacogenetics aspects of the WBP2NL gene remains limited, with no direct associations currently established between the gene and specific drug responses. Given its specific expression and role in sperm function, WBP2NL is unlikely to emerge as a major player in common pharmacogenetic panels used to customize treatments for broad medical conditions. However, understanding variations within WBP2NL could potentially contribute to treatments or interventions targeting male infertility in a personalized medicine context. Further studies might explore how variations in this gene affect sperm functions, potentially influencing infertility treatments.
