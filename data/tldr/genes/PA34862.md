## Gene Summary
RRAS2, officially known as Ras-related protein R-Ras2, is a member of the RAS family of small GTPases that are involved in various cellular processes including growth, adhesion, survival, and differentiation. RRAS2 interacts with multiple effector proteins and plays roles in intracellular signaling pathways that control the dynamics of cell adhesion and migration. Its expression is observed in various tissues, including heart, brain, and muscle, indicating its potentially diverse biological importance.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
RRAS2 has been implicated in pathways related to the RAS/MAPK signaling cascade, which is critical for cellular proliferation and differentiation. Disturbances in these signaling pathways can contribute to the development of diseases such as cancer. Additionally, due to its involvement in cell motility and adhesion, RRAS2 is considered relevant in processes of metastasis in cancerous conditions. Currently, research on RRAS2 is underway to better understand its role in specific disease scenarios and its association with particular phenotypes, especially in oncology.

## Pharmacogenetics
Although pharmacogenetic data specifically concerning RRAS2 is somewhat limited, the gene's involvement in signaling pathways frequently targeted by anticancer drugs suggests it might influence drug response. In the context of pharmacogenetics, RRAS2 could potentially impact responses to drugs that target the RAS/MAPK pathway, such as MEK inhibitors used in the treatment of cancers. Further research into RRAS2-specific pharmacogenetics is required to better establish these associations and potentially guide personalized therapy options based on RRAS2 mutations or expression levels.
