## Gene Summary
TGFBR2, or Transforming Growth Factor Beta Receptor 2, is a gene that encodes for a serine/threonine kinase type II receptor involved in the Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway. This receptor forms a heteromeric complex with TGFBR1, allowing it to propagate signals that regulate cell growth and differentiation. TGFBR2 is widely expressed in various tissues, including the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. Its activity is crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis and plays a significant role in the immune response, angiogenesis, and cellular proliferation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
TGFBR2 is linked to numerous critical pathways such as the TGF-β signaling pathway, which impacts fibrosis, wound healing, and immune regulation. Dysregulation or mutations in TGFBR2 are associated with several diseases including cancer (most notably colorectal cancer), Marfan syndrome, and Loeys-Dietz syndrome. The gene is also implicated in the pathogenesis of heart diseases and skeletal disorders. Due to the gene's role in cellular proliferation and migration, it is a target of interest in cancer research, with potential implications in the development of anti-cancer therapies.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, TGFBR2 is of interest mainly due to its involvement in cancer pathways, and its mutation or altered expression can influence the response to certain chemotherapeutic agents. For instance, TGFBR2 mutations can determine the sensitivity or resistance to drugs that target the TGF-β pathway. Although specific pharmacogenetic associations between TGFBR2 and therapeutic drugs are not as well characterized as for some other genes, the understanding of its pathway interactions suggests potential for future targeted therapies, especially in oncology. Treatments that modulate the TGF-β signaling may be particularly relevant in cancers where TGFBR2 is mutated or dysregulated.
