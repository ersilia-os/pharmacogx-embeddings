## Gene Summary
LPA, or lipoprotein(a), encodes the protein apolipoprotein(a), which is a component of the lipoprotein particles. LPA is primarily involved in lipid metabolism and transport. The gene structure is notable for a variable number of kringle IV repeats, which largely determines the size of the apolipoprotein(a) isoforms and influences the plasma concentration of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]. Lp(a) levels are highly heritable and largely determined by the LPA gene locus. Highly expressed in the liver, the lipoprotein(a) particles carry cholesterol and have a structure similar to low-density lipoprotein (LDL), featuring a single copy of apolipoprotein B-100 and apolipoprotein(a).

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
LPA is significant in a number of cardiovascular diseases. Elevated Lp(a) levels are a risk factor for atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, and peripheral arterial disease. Various variants within this gene have been associated with differences in Lp(a) levels and, consequently, in the risk of these diseases. LPA is also connected to the development of calcific aortic valve stenosis and possibly to Alzheimer's disease. Pathophysiologically, it may contribute to the diseases by promoting inflammation, oxidative processes, and contributing to thrombogenesis due to its structural similarity to plasminogen.

## Pharmacogenetics
LPA is pivotal in personalized medicine, especially in cardiovascular pharmacogenetics. Due to its role in lipid metabolism and cardiovascular diseases, LPA has been a target for genetic testing to predict an individual's risk for diseases such as CAD and stroke. Drugs that are able to influence Lp(a) levels are limited, but niacin (nicotinic acid) can lower Lp(a) levels, although its use has been overshadowed by undesirable side effects and a lack of evidence that it improves cardiovascular outcomes. More recently, emerging therapies like antisense oligonucleotides (e.g., pelacarsen) specifically targeting LPA mRNA have shown promise in significantly reducing Lp(a) levels and may potentially mitigate associated cardiovascular risk. These developments highlight the importance of understanding LPA's genetic variations, which can profoundly affect therapeutic outcomes in cardiovascular disease management.
