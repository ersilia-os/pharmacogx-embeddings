## Gene Summary
CYP3A4, officially known as Cytochrome P450 Family 3 Subfamily A Member 4, is a key enzyme in the cytochrome P450 superfamily. It is predominantly expressed in the liver and small intestine. CYP3A4 plays a crucial role in the metabolism of approximately half of all drugs, functioning by oxidizing substrates, which often facilitates their excretion or deactivates them. This enzyme is also involved in the metabolism of steroids, toxins, and some fatty acids.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CYP3A4 is implicated in the metabolism of a wide array of drugs including but not limited to antifungals, statins, immunosuppressants, and chemotherapeutics. Its activity can be influenced by various factors leading to significant variation in drug metabolism among individuals. For instance, inducers like rifampin and carbamazepine can increase CYP3A4 activity, whereas inhibitors such as ketoconazole and erythromycin can decrease its activity. Perturbations in CYP3A4 activity are linked to variability in drug efficacy and toxicity, influencing therapeutic outcomes and adverse drug reactions.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of CYP3A4 shows substantial impact on drug metabolism and response. Genetic polymorphisms in CYP3A4 can alter enzyme activity and affect the metabolism rates of drugs, leading to differences in drug efficacy and risk of adverse effects. Commonly studied drugs in this context include midazolam and cyclosporine, where variability in CYP3A4 activity can significantly influence pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Identification of specific CYP3A4 alleles can guide dose adjustments and choice of therapy, enhancing personalized medicine approaches. For example, CYP3A4*1B and CYP3A4*22 alleles are associated with altered enzyme activity, impacting the clinical outcomes of therapies involving CYP3A4-metabolized drugs.
