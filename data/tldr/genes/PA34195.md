## Gene Summary
PPP1R13L, officially known as Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Subunit 13 Like, is a gene involved in regulating apoptosis and modulating inflammatory responses. PPP1R13L encodes the iASPP protein, which is an inhibitory member of the apoptosis-stimulating proteins p53 family. iASPP interacts with several other proteins including p53, a major tumor suppressor gene, and inhibits apoptosis mediated by p53. The gene is expressed in various tissues, being particularly notable in immune cells, where it plays a role in regulating the immune response and cell survival.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
PPP1R13L is implicated in the mechanisms underlying several cancers, specifically through its interaction with p53 and NF-κB. Abnormalities in its expression could lead to evasion of apoptosis, giving cancer cells a survival advantage. Additionally, its role in immune regulation suggests potential implications in autoimmune diseases. Research has also connected variations in the PPP1R13L gene to differences in sensitivity to radiation therapy in cancer treatment, indicating a potential influence on treatment outcomes. PPP1R13L is involved in the p53 signaling pathway and the NF-κB signaling pathway, which are critical in cell cycle regulation and immune responses, respectively.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of PPP1R13L primarily revolve around its influence in cancer pharmacology. Studies have suggested that PPP1R13L's interaction with p53 might modulate the efficacy and outcome of treatments that aim to activate p53 in tumors where p53 is not mutated. For instance, drugs targeting p53, including Nutlin-3, which inhibits the interaction between MDM2 and p53, could potentially be impacted by PPP1R13L expression levels. Additionally, the gene's role in modulating immune responses may influence the effectiveness of immunomodulatory therapies, although specific drugs interacting with PPP1R13L through this mechanism have not yet been thoroughly studied or identified.
