## Gene Summary
CYP26A1, standing for Cytochrome P450 Family 26 Subfamily A Member 1, is a crucial enzyme in the human body primarily involved in the metabolism of retinoic acid (RA). As a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes, CYP26A1 plays a pivotal role in maintaining the physiological balance of RA by catalyzing its degradation. This enzyme is expressed in various tissues but shows higher expression in the liver and brain. The regulation of retinoic acid levels by CYP26A1 is critical for proper embryonic development, and its dysfunction is linked to developmental anomalies.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CYP26A1 is implicated in several key biological pathways, primarily involving the metabolism of retinoic acid, which affects cellular differentiation and apoptosis. Altered activity of this enzyme can disrupt retinoic acid homeostasis, potentially leading to developmental disorders and diseases such as microphthalmia and holoprosencephaly when aberrantly expressed. This enzymeâ€™s activity and regulation are crucial during embryogenesis and in the renewal of adult tissues. The modulation of CYP26A1 activity is also being explored for therapeutic purposes in the treatment of diseases like psoriasis and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), conditions where retinoic acid signaling is notably dysregulated.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of CYP26A1 primarily involves its role in modulating responses to drugs that affect retinoic acid pathways. Notably, inhibitors of CYP26A1, such as talarozole and R115866, are being studied in clinical trials for enhancing the effects of retinoic acid in dermatological conditions and oncology, where RA plays a role in treatment outcomes. The modulation of CYP26A1 activity influences the efficacy and toxicity of retinoid therapies used in these diseases, indicating a potentially significant pharmacogenetic relationship. Understanding individual variations in the CYP26A1 gene might lead to more personalized approaches in managing conditions associated with disrupted retinoic acid signaling.
