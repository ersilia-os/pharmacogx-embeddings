## Gene Summary
IDH1, or isocitrate dehydrogenase 1, encodes a cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate into alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG), producing NADPH in the process. This reaction is a part of the citric acid cycle which is essential for cellular metabolism and energy production. IDH1 is expressed in a variety of tissues, though its activity is notably high in the liver. Mutations in IDH1 are known to result in the production of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) instead of α-KG, an oncometabolite implicated in tumorigenesis by influencing gene expression and DNA methylation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in IDH1 have been primarily associated with specific types of cancer, notably gliomas, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and chondrosarcomas. The aberrant enzyme produced by mutant IDH1 leads to pathological accumulation of 2-HG, contributing to the cancer phenotype by disrupting cellular metabolism and epigenetic regulation. These mutations are often early events in the pathogenesis of these cancers and can influence prognosis and therapeutic response. Pathways involving IDH1 are central in cellular energy metabolism and are key components in studies of cancer metabolism, giving insights into oncogenic processes at the metabolic level.

## Pharmacogenetics
The clinical relevance of IDH1 in pharmacogenetics is highlighted by targeted cancer therapies. Drugs specifically designed to inhibit mutant IDH1 enzymes, such as Ivosidenib (AG-120), have been developed and approved for treating patients with IDH1-mutated AML. This represents a prominent example of a personalized medicine approach where the therapeutic strategy is tailored according to the specific genetic mutation present in a patient's tumor. Additionally, the presence of IDH1 mutations may influence the efficacy of other chemotherapeutic agents owing to the altered metabolic state of cancer cells harboring these mutations. Hence, monitoring IDH1 mutation status is crucial in the personalized treatment planning for patients with certain types of cancers.
