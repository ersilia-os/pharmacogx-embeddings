## Gene Summary
**ADORA1** refers to the Adenosine A1 Receptor gene, encoding the receptor for adenosine. ADORA1 is expressed primarily in the brain, heart, and kidneys, playing a crucial role in numerous physiological processes. Upon activation by adenosine, the receptor modulates neurotransmitter release, generally exerting an inhibitory effect on nerve transmission. This makes it instrumental in promoting sleep, regulating myocardial oxygen consumption and electrical activity of the heart, and modulating renal blood flow through its action on the G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The ADORA1 gene is linked to several pathways that involve adenylate cyclase inhibition, potassium channel opening, and calcium channel inhibition. This gene's activity has implications in conditions such as cardiac arrhythmias, cerebral ischemia, and renal disorders due to its role in modulating blood flow and neuronal activity. Moreover, its influence on sleep promotes studies into sleep disorders. In pharmacology, ADORA1 has been targeted to manage conditions like arrhythmias, neuroprotection during cerebral ischemic events, and controlling renal function.

## Pharmacogenetics
Variations in the **ADORA1** gene can affect the pharmacodynamics of drugs targeting the adenosine receptors. The most noted pharmacogenetic aspect of ADORA1 involves its interaction with adenosine and drugs that are adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists, used primarily to manage supraventricular tachycardia and contribute to neuroprotection protocols in ischemic strokes. For instance, drugs like adenosine itself, which is used during cardiac stress testing and treatment of certain types of supraventricular tachycardia, are affected by variations in this receptor's functionality. Understanding individual genetic differences in ADORA1 can guide more tailored therapy, improve efficacy, and reduce adverse effects in the clinical setting.
