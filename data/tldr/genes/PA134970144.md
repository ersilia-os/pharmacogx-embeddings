## Gene Summary
VPS13D, standing for Vacuolar Protein Sorting 13 Homolog D, is a gene that plays a critical role in cellular processes such as autophagy and mitochondrial function. It encodes a protein that is part of the VPS13 family, involved in the transport of various molecules between organelles. VPS13D has been observed to localize predominantly to mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, where it appears essential for maintaining cellular energy balance and the health of mitochondria. The expression of VPS13D is widespread, indicating its fundamental role in cell physiology.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
VPS13D has been linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, particularly movement disorders. Mutations in VPS13D are associated with conditions such as spastic ataxia and VPS13D-related movement disorders, characterized by symptoms like ataxia, spasticity, and parkinsonism. These associations indicate a critical role of VPS13D in neurological integrity and functioning. The gene is involved in major biological pathways such as autophagy, mitochondrial quality control, and intracellular protein transport, underlining its contribution to cellular homeostasis and response to stress.

## Pharmacogenetics
Presently, there is limited specific pharmacogenetic data on VPS13D concerning drug interactions or responses. However, given its involvement in critical cellular pathways such as mitochondrial function and autophagy, it is plausible that future research could reveal significant pharmacogenetic associations. This may involve identifying how genetic variations in VPS13D influence the efficacy and safety of drugs used in the treatment of related movement disorders or in therapies targeting mitochondrial dysfunctions. Understanding these associations could be crucial for tailoring therapeutic strategies and for the development of new drugs targeting the pathways regulated by VPS13D.
