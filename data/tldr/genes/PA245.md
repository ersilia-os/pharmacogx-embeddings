## Gene Summary
MTHFR, or methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, is a crucial enzyme in the folate metabolism pathway, specifically catalyzing the conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, the principal form of folate in plasma. This methylated form of folate is vital for homocysteine metabolism, playing a key role in methylation processes, including DNA and protein methylation. MTHFR expression is ubiquitous but particularly pronounced in the liver and the kidneys. Genetic variations in MTHFR can significantly impact enzyme activity and are implicated in different metabolic and vascular conditions.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in MTHFR can lead to a decreased efficiency of folate processing, which may result in elevated homocysteine levels, a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and can influence occurrences of neural tube defects, stroke, and certain types of cancer. The enzyme is also linked to varied health issues including neurological disorders, psychiatric disorders, and complications in pregnancies. The gene is part of the folate metabolic pathway which intersects with methionine metabolism and homocysteine degradation pathways, implicating it in a complex network of biochemical pathways critical for cell growth and function.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetics of MTHFR primarily involves understanding how variations affect response to medications that influence folate metabolism. Notably, common polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene, such as C677T and A1298C, alter enzyme function and affect the pharmacological profiles of antifolate drugs. Drugs like methotrexate, used in cancer therapy and autoimmune diseases, and antiepileptics such as phenytoin and carbamazepine, are impacted by MTHFR mutations. These mutations can predict different responses to these treatments, often requiring adjustments in drug dosing or choice of medication to mitigate adverse effects and optimize therapeutic efficacy. Further, folate supplementation is commonly recommended for individuals with MTHFR variants to help lower homocysteine levels and mitigate associated disease risks.
