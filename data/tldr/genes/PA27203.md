## Gene Summary
DDX12P, or DEAD-Box Helicase 12 Pseudogene, is classified as a pseudogene containing presumptive sequences for RNA helicase activities but lacks active transcription. Pseudogenes are segments of DNA that are related to genuine genes but have typically lost their protein-coding ability or are otherwise not expressed in the cell. DDX12P structurally resembles members of the DEAD box protein family, which are involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism, including translation initiation, pre-mRNA splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Due to its classification as a pseudogene, DDX12P is not actively associated with any specific drugs, diseases, or clinical phenotypes in a direct manner. Typically, pseudogenes do not participate directly in biochemical pathways due to their lack of expression. However, the study of pseudogenes like DDX12P can contribute to understanding genomic evolution, gene expression regulation, and potential non-coding functions in the genome.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the field of pharmacogenetics, DDX12P does not have known associations with drug responses or interactions because it is not an expressed gene. Pseudogenes, including DDX12P, generally do not encode proteins and hence do not directly impact drug metabolism, efficacy, or toxicity. However, research into pseudogenes might shed light on genetic regulatory networks that could indirectly influence pharmacogenetic traits by affecting the expression and function of other active genes.
