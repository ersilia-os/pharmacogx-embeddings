## Gene Summary
ETFDH stands for "electron transfer flavoprotein-ubiquinone oxidoreductase", an enzyme crucial in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It plays an essential role in the final step of the electron transfer in the mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway. ETFDH converts reduced electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) to its oxidized form and transfers electrons to ubiquinone, participating in cellular energy production. The gene encoding ETFDH is located on chromosome 4q32-qter. Its expression is ubiquitous but particularly important in metabolically active tissues like liver, heart, and skeletal muscle.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in ETFDH are primarily associated with a spectrum of metabolic disorders, especially multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD), also known as glutaric aciduria type II. This autosomal recessive disorder presents in various forms, ranging from severe neonatal onset with congenital anomalies to milder adult-onset forms without anomalies. The primary pathway involved is the fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway. The disruption of this pathway due to faulty ETFDH interferes with the body's ability to use certain fats for energy, particularly during periods of fasting.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the realm of pharmacogenetics, specific focus on ETFDH is limited as it primarily relates to metabolic processing rather than direct drug interactions or metabolisms. However, ETFDH mutations causing MADD have implications in treatment approaches, emphasizing the importance of understanding an individual's genetic makeup in managing the disease. Treatments may include dietary management with supplements such as riboflavin (vitamin B2), L-carnitine, and coenzyme Q10, which are aimed at enhancing the residual activity of the electron transfer pathway. Detailed genetic information can guide the dosing and choice of such supplements to optimize clinical outcomes, underscoring the practical applications of pharmacogenetics in treating metabolic disorders influenced by ETFDH gene mutations.
