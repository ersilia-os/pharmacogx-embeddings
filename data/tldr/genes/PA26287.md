## Gene Summary
CDH13, or Cadherin 13, is a member of the cadherin superfamily. Unlike classical cadherins, which are transmembrane proteins involved in cell adhesion, CDH13 is an atypical cadherin because it lacks transmembrane domains and is instead attached to the cell surface by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. CDH13 is highly expressed in the cardiovascular system, brain, and adipose tissue. It plays significant roles in cell adhesion, neural connectivity, and vascular endothelial function. Notably, its function extends beyond structural roles to modulating processes like synaptic signaling and vascular integrity.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CDH13 has been linked to a variety of pathophysiological states, particularly in relation to cardiovascular diseases (such as hypertension and heart disease), metabolic syndrome, neurological diseases (like ADHD and autism), and certain types of cancer (such as breast cancer). Phenotypically, variations in CDH13 are associated with personality traits including harm avoidance and novelty seeking. In terms of molecular pathways, CDH13 interacts with various proteins involved in cell signaling and has been implicated in pathways related to cell adhesion, neuronal activity, and endothelial function.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of CDH13 is an emerging area of interest. While direct associations with specific drugs have not been extensively characterized yet, genetic variants of CDH13 have shown potential influence on the efficacy and metabolism of cardiovascular drugs, such as antihypertensives. This is due to its role in vascular biology and endothelial functions that are often targeted by cardiovascular therapies. Additionally, given its involvement in neural pathways, CDH13 variants might modify responses to neuropsychiatric medications, although more detailed studies are required to substantiate these associations. Conducting in-depth pharmacogenetic research on CDH13 could lead to more personalized and effective therapeutic regimens for disorders related to its expression profile.
