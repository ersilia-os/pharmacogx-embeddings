## Gene Summary
ASTN2 (Astrotactin 2) is a gene that encodes the protein astrotactin 2, predominantly involved in neuronal migration and brain development. The gene is mainly expressed in the brain, specifically in the cerebellum and frontal cortex, areas associated with complex cognitive functions and motor control. ASTN2 has a role in guiding neuronal glial cells during brain development. It works in conjunction with other genes and proteins to ensure the proper migration of neurons to their appropriate locations, which is crucial for establishing neural networks and functional brain architecture.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
While ASTN2 is not directly linked to specific drugs, it is associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders and developmental phenotypes. Research has shown correlations between polymorphisms or mutations in ASTN2 and conditions such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia. These associations suggest that disruptions in ASTN2 can lead to altered neuronal connectivity and may contribute to the phenotypic manifestations of these disorders. The gene is involved in pathways related to neuron migration and adhesion processes, critical for proper brain development and function.

## Pharmacogenetics
In terms of pharmacogenetics, ASTN2 does not have a direct association with specific drug responses or adverse drug reactions as prominently as genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes or drug targets. However, considering its role in neuropsychiatric conditions, understanding genetic variations in ASTN2 could help in predicting the onset or severity of these conditions and potentially influence the treatment strategies. While no direct drugs target ASTN2, knowledge of its genetic makeup could be crucial in the context of personalized medicine for neurological disorders, aiming at neural development and function optimization. Future research might uncover more about how ASTN2 variations affect responses to medications used in treating associated neuropsychiatric disorders.
