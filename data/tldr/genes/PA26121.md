## Gene Summary
CBR1, or Carbonyl Reductase 1, is an enzyme encoded by the CBR1 gene in humans. This enzyme is part of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily, primarily involved in the metabolism of endogenous and xenobiotic carbonyl compounds. CBR1 catalyzes the reduction of carbonyl groups to secondary alcohols using NADPH as a cofactor. It is widely expressed in various tissues with significant representation in the liver, kidneys, and heart. Its expression and activity can influence the detoxification processes and metabolic pathways in the body.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CBR1 is implicated in the metabolism of several important drugs and has roles in resistance to therapeutic agents, particularly in cancer. The enzyme interacts with drugs such as doxorubicin, an anticancer agent, where it contributes to the reductive metabolism that may modulate drug toxicity and effectiveness. The pathway involvement extends to prostaglandin and leukotriene metabolism, contributing to inflammatory processes and cardiovascular functions. Dysregulation or genetic variations in CBR1 activity have been associated with disease states such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and possibly diabetes.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic implications of CBR1 are significant, particularly in chemotherapy drug metabolism. Polymorphisms in CBR1 can alter the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of several drugs, affecting their toxicity and therapeutic efficacy. For example, variants in CBR1 have been linked with altered cardiotoxicity risk in patients treated with doxorubicin. Additionally, CBR1 metabolizes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and certain antidiabetic medications, though the clinical implications of these interactions are less clear. Understanding the genetic variation in CBR1 can be crucial for tailoring individual drug therapies, reducing adverse effects, and improving clinical outcomes.
