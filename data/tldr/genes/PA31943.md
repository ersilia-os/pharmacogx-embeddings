## Gene Summary
OPRK1 is the official symbol for the opioid receptor kappa 1. This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. Specifically, OPRK1 functions as a receptor for kappa opioid peptides, which are naturally occurring peptides with potent analgesic properties. The receptor's activation leads to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, reduced cellular cAMP levels, and subsequent modulation of signal transduction pathways. This results in effects such as pain relief, sedation, and mood changes. OPRK1 is broadly expressed in the human brain, particularly in regions involved in mood, reward, and pain processing.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The OPRK1 gene is pivotal in the dynamics of pain management and drug addiction. It is associated with a range of pharmacological agents, largely analgesics that are used in treating acute and chronic pain conditions. Disease associations primarily revolve around substance dependence, particularly opioid addiction, and mood disorders such as depression. The pathways linked to OPRK1 include opioid signaling pathways and multiple neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathways. Dysregulation of this receptor can influence the susceptibility to pain disorders and addiction phenotypes.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of OPRK1 is particularly important in the context of opioid medications. Variants of this gene can alter receptor binding and influence the efficacy and safety of opioid analgesics. Patients with certain polymorphisms in OPRK1 may experience varied response to drugs like pentazocine, a kappa opioid receptor agonist used for moderate to severe pain. Moreover, these genetic variations are considered in the treatment and management strategies for opioid addiction, influencing responses to treatments like buprenorphine, which is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and an antagonist at kappa opioid receptors. Understanding an individual's OPRK1 genotype can be pivotal in customizing their treatment plans for both pain management and addiction therapy, enhancing therapeutic efficacy while minimizing risks of side effects and dependency.
