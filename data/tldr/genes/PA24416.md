## Gene Summary
AOC1, also known as Amine Oxidase, Copper Containing 1, encodes the enzyme diamine oxidase. This enzyme is responsible for the metabolism of histamine and other polyamines within the body. It catalyzes the oxidative deamination of diamines, polyamines, and histamine, leading to the production of ammonia, aldehydes, and hydrogen peroxide. AOC1 is highly expressed in tissues with barrier functions such as the intestines, kidney, and placenta. It plays a critical role in the regulation of histamine levels, influencing processes like immune response, gastric acid secretion, and intestinal function.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
AOC1â€™s primary function is involved in the regulation and metabolism of histamine, impacting a variety of physiological systems. Dysregulation of AOC1 activity is implicated in conditions characterized by abnormal histamine levels, such as allergies, asthma, and certain gastrointestinal disorders. The gene's product, diamine oxidase, regulates histamine from exogenous sources (e.g., food) and endogenous cells (e.g., mast cells), thus playing a significant role in inflammatory responses and allergic reactions. Pathways associated with AOC1 include the metabolism of biogenic amines and the histamine metabolism pathway.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of AOC1 primarily revolve around its role in histamine metabolism. Variations in AOC1 gene expression or enzyme activity can influence the effectiveness and side effects of antihistamines and other drugs that target histamine receptors. Although no direct associations with specific drugs have been widely established or commercialized, research indicates that variations in AOC1 could influence the response to treatments in diseases like allergies and histamine intolerance where histamine plays a central role. Understanding the genetic differences in AOC1 activity can be crucial for tailoring individual therapeutic strategies that involve modulation of histamine levels.
