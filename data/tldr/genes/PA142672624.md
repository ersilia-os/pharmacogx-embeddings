## Gene Summary
ANKFN1, or Ankyrin Repeat and Fibronectin Type III Domain Containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular functions, including molecular binding and signal transduction. The ANKFN1 protein is characterized by the presence of multiple ankyrin repeats and fibronectin type-III domains which are common in proteins that function in cell-cell communication and signaling networks. It is expressed in several tissues, with variable expression levels depending on the developmental stage and cellular context.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The specific functional implications of ANKFN1 in diseases and pathways are not fully delineated, but proteins containing similar domains are known to be crucial in developmental processes and in maintaining cellular structure. Misregulation or mutations in similar genes can lead to a variety of pathologies, primarily those that are neurodevelopmental and muscular in nature. Due to its structural domains, ANKFN1 might be implicated in signaling pathways that regulate cellular architecture and intercellular communication.

## Pharmacogenetics
As of the current knowledge and available data, specific pharmacogenetic associations involving ANKFN1 with particular drugs are not well-established or documented. This gene has not been highlighted prominently in pharmacogenetic research or clinical guidelines involving drug responses or adverse drug reactions. Further studies could potentially illuminate any relevant interactions this gene may have in pharmacology or personalized medicine based on its protein structure and involvement in cellular signaling pathways.
