## Gene Summary
TMEM196, or transmembrane protein 196, is a gene that encodes a protein whose specific functions remain relatively undefined at detail in broader scientific literature. Predominantly, TMEM196 is associated with roles in cellular processes due to its localization in the endoplasmic reticulum. The expression of TMEM196 is identified in various tissue types, indicating a potentially widespread role in cellular function, yet the precise physiological and biochemical functions are not extensively characterized.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Currently, the direct connections of TMEM196 with specific drugs, diseases, or phenotypes are not well-documented. Given the ubiquitous nature of its expression, it might interact with general cellular pathways, including those involved in protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, these interactions and their implications for specific physiological pathways or disease states require further exploration and validation in the context of clinical or pharmacological research.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics profile of TMEM196 is not well established as of the current scientific understanding. There are no direct associations known between TMEM196 and the metabolism, efficacy, or side effects of specific pharmacological agents. Research into the gene's implications in pharmacogenetics would require more detailed studies examining how variations in TMEM196 might affect drug response, which could be crucial for drugs impacting cellular processes involving the endoplasmic reticulum. The development of such pharmacogenetic data would be essential to elucidate potential roles of TMEM196 in clinical pharmacology.
