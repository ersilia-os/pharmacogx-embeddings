## Gene Summary
PAH, or phenylalanine hydroxylase, is an enzyme encoded by the PAH gene in humans. Essential in the metabolic pathway of phenylalanine, PAH converts the amino acid phenylalanine to tyrosine. This process is crucial for normal protein degradation and synthesis. The activity of PAH is dependent on the presence of cofactors such as tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). PAH is predominantly expressed in the liver, which is the primary site for phenylalanine metabolism, although it does have minor expression in the kidneys and pancreas.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The function of PAH is critical in preventing the buildup of phenylalanine in the blood. Hence, mutations in PAH are directly linked to phenylketonuria (PKU), a disease characterized by intellectual disability, microcephaly, developmental delays, and skin rashes if untreated. PKU's inheritance pattern is autosomal recessive. The pathway focused around PAH predominantly involves the metabolism of amino acids and disorders of phenylalanine and tyrosine. Treatment approaches for PKU often include dietary management to control phenylalanine intake and the administration of BH4 in some responsive cases.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics associated with PAH primarily revolves around the management of phenylketonuria. Variants in the PAH gene can dictate responsiveness to specific treatments such as sapropterin dihydrochloride, a synthetic form of BH4. This drug can help to reduce blood phenylalanine levels in some individuals with PKU who are responsive to BH4. Response to this therapy varies significantly between patients due to the different mutations within the PAH gene-making genetic testing a critical component of tailored PKU management. Recognizing oneâ€™s specific genetic mutation(s) in PAH can help in predicting the effectiveness of sapropterin therapy, which greatly aids in individualizing treatment plans and optimizing dietary recommendations.
