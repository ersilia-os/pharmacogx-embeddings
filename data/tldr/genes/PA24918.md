## Gene Summary
AQP1, or Aquaporin 1, is a gene located on chromosome 7 that is responsible for encoding a water channel protein found in various tissues, notably in the red blood cells and kidney tubules. AQP1 plays a crucial role in regulating water flow within cells and maintaining water homeostasis throughout the body. This channel is an integral membrane protein and is pivotal in transcellular and transepithelial water movement, thus influencing urine concentration and the maintenance of water balance.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
AQP1 is involved in the physiopathology of several diseases, including congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and various kidney disorders. It has also been implicated in tumor growth and metastasis, particularly in conditions where cell migration is a factor. The proteinâ€™s expression and function are associated with the cellular pathways that handle water balance and cellular migration, impacting both osmoregulation and cancer progression. A decrease or dysfunction in AQP1 has been linked to reduced cell migration, which can affect wound healing and cancer cell metastasis.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic implications of AQP1 are primarily associated with its role in water homeostasis and cell migration. Although direct drug associations are not extensively established, the manipulation of AQP1 activity could offer potential therapeutic strategies in treating conditions like glaucoma, stroke, and tumors where water transport is disrupted or needs regulation. Studies exploring AQP1 inhibitors or modulators are ongoing, aiming to harness its function for therapeutic benefits, especially in minimizing edema and managing fluid accumulation in brain injuries or diseases.
