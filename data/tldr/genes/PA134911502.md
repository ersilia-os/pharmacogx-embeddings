## Gene Summary
SLC22A16, belonging to the solute carrier family 22, plays a crucial role in the transport of organic ions at the cellular level, particularly in the uptake and distribution of chemotherapeutic agents. This gene is mainly expressed in tissues such as the liver, the blood-brain barrier, and notably in the heart. Additionally, it has a particular affinity for transporting hormonal compounds and various xenobiotics, thus influencing the pharmacokinetics of various drugs.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SLC22A16 has been implicated in the modulation of doxorubicin, a key chemotherapeutic agent used widely in cancer treatment, specifically in managing certain leukemias and solid tumors. This gene is part of the pharmacokinetic pathways affecting drug distribution and excretion. There is mounting evidence that variations in this gene may influence the efficacy and toxicity of therapies, underscoring its potential implications in chemotherapy resistance and cardiac toxicity. Furthermore, research is exploring its linkage with response to other medications and susceptibility to various cardiac conditions given its expression profile.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, SLC22A16 is an emerging player particularly relevant in the context of chemotherapy. Studies have reported associations between genetic variants of SLC22A16 and altered pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin, suggesting these variants may influence drug transport leading to variations in drug efficiency and toxicity; this can significantly dictate the clinical outcome in cancer treatments which employ this drug. Enhanced understanding and subsequent integration of SLC22A16 genetics into clinical settings could help tailor chemotherapy treatments based on individual genetic makeup to optimise efficacy and minimize adverse effects, specifically cardiotoxicity, a severe side effect associated with certain chemotherapy agents.
