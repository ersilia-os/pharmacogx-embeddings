## Gene Summary
POM121L2 (POM121 transmembrane nucleoporin like 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in nuclear pore complex (NPC) assembly or function. The protein is part of a subunit critical for nuclear envelope and pore formation, essential processes for nucleo-cytoplasmic transport mechanisms. Although detailed functional annotations are somewhat limited, it is known that as a nucleoporin, POM121L2 shares similarities with POM121, likely engaging in roles tied to transport across the nuclear membrane and possibly in nuclear structure organization.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
To date, there is limited detailed information on specific drugs or diseases directly related to POM121L2. The gene's primary role in nucleoporin functions might suggest a broad impact on cellular functionality, primarily influencing processes reliant on nuclear transport. In terms of disease association, alterations in nuclear pore complexes are generally linked with age-related diseases, certain cancers, and some complex genetic disorders, although specific links to POM121L2 need further investigation. As for pathways, given its potential structural and transport roles, it may influence numerous signaling and metabolic pathways indirectly by regulating nuclear transport.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there is minimal information available concerning specific pharmacogenetic associations between POM121L2 and clinically used drugs. The gene's role in fundamental cellular processes suggests potential broad-spectrum effects on drug efficacy and metabolism, especially for drugs whose action involves nuclear transcription factors or other elements that interact with the NPC. However, specific drugs directly associated with pharmacogenetic effects through variations in POM121L2 have not been extensively documented or studied, highlighting a potential area for future pharmacogenetic research to explore how this gene might influence drug response at a cellular or systemic level.
