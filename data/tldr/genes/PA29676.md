## Gene Summary
IFNGR2 (Interferon Gamma Receptor 2) is a gene encoding the interferon gamma receptor 2, which forms a part of the receptor complex essential for the cellular response to interferon gamma (IFN-γ). IFNGR2 complexes with IFNGR1 to provide a binding site for IFN-γ, and upon binding, initiates a signaling cascade that activates immune response mechanisms, mainly through the JAK-STAT pathway. This gene plays a crucial role in immunity, particularly in host defense mechanisms against viral and intracellular bacterial infections, and it is expressed in various tissues, with higher expression in immune system cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
IFNGR2 is implicated in several immune-related disorders, primarily through its function in the IFN-γ signaling pathway. Associated diseases include Mendelian Susceptibility to Mycobacterial Disease (MSMD), where mutations can lead to a functional defect in the IFNGR2 protein, compromising the body's ability to combat mycobacterial infections effectively. The pathway mainly involved is the cytokine signaling in the immune system, focusing on the activation and response mechanisms mediated by interferons. In terms of drug discovery and development, the role of IFNGR2 makes it a potential target for immunomodulating therapies, especially for boosting the immune response in infectious diseases and perhaps in tumor immune surveillance.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic relevance of IFNGR2 mainly lies in its role in modulating the immune response, influencing the efficacy and safety of drugs that target immune pathways. There are no direct major drug associations specified; however, understanding variations in IFNGR2 could impact treatments involving cytokines such as interferon therapies. For instance, altered responses to interferon-based therapies in conditions such as chronic hepatitis, multiple sclerosis, or certain cancers could possibly be mediated through genetic variations in components of the interferon signaling pathway, including IFNGR2. Clinical relevance may also extend to personalized approaches in treating or managing diseases like MSMD, where understanding individual genetic profiles can guide interferon therapy options and predict treatment responses.
