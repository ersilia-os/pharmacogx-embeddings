## Gene Summary
TENM4, also known as teneurin transmembrane protein 4, is a gene that encodes a member of the teneurin family. This protein family is characterized by its roles in developmental processes, particularly in the nervous system. TENM4 is involved in cellular signaling, neuronal patterning, and cell-cell adhesion, contributing to neural circuit formation and synaptic development. It is expressed predominantly in the central nervous system but also found in other tissues like muscle and the immune system.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Research has identified connections between mutations in TENM4 and various neurological and developmental disorders. Notably, variants of this gene have been implicated in essential tremor and other movement disorders, suggesting a neurodevelopmental component to these conditions. TENM4's role in cell adhesion and signaling pathways also hints at potential implications in diseases involving synaptic dysfunctions, such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders. The gene is involved in multiple biological pathways related to neural development and intercellular communication.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there is limited specific pharmacogenetic data associated with TENM4, especially in the context of direct drug interactions or treatment response variations. The gene's identified roles in neurological conditions could, however, inform future pharmacogenetic research, potentially leading to targeted therapies aimed at modulating TENM4's activity in the brain for conditions like essential tremor. Continued exploration into TENM4 could reveal more about its influence on treatment outcomes in neural and developmental disorders.
