## Gene Summary
DCBLD1, also known as Discoidin, CUB and LCCL domain-containing protein 1, is a gene that encodes the protein Espin in humans. This protein is involved in various cellular processes including signal transduction and cell communication. DCBLD1 is expressed in many tissues but is particularly prominent in vascular and nervous tissues. This gene participates in modulating cellular responses such as migration and proliferation, which are crucial for tissue development and repair.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
While specific drugs targeting DCBLD1 are not widely reported, the gene plays a role in critical pathways that may influence the development of various diseases. It is particularly associated with vascular and neurological disorders due to its expression patterns and influence on cell signaling dynamics in these tissues. Diseases such as atherosclerosis, cancer, and potentially neurodegenerative disorders could be linked to dysfunctions in the pathways involving DCBLD1. Its role in angiogenesis and cellular growth processes also hints at its involvement in cancer progression and metastasis.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of DCBLD1 is not extensively documented, and as of the last update, there are limited direct associations between DCBLD1 and drug responses or adverse drug reactions. However, given its role in critical signaling pathways, future research might uncover relevant pharmacogenetic data that could lead to personalized treatment strategies, especially in diseases like cancer where pathway-targeted therapies are prominent. Understanding the genetic variations in DCBLD1 could potentially influence the efficacy and safety of therapies targeting similar pathways or processes.
