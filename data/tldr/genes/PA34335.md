## Gene Summary
The RET gene encodes the Rearranged during Transfection protein, a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in key signaling pathways that regulate neural crest development. This gene is crucial for the development of several cell lineages, including neurons and cells in the intestinal nervous system. RET signaling is primarily activated by the glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor family ligands that bind to RET in conjunction with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked co-receptor. Activation of RET leads to autophosphorylation and subsequent activation of several intracellular signaling pathways, including MAPK, PI3K, and PLCÎ³, which influence cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, and survival. 

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in RET are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), Hirschsprung disease, and other forms of thyroid cancer, particularly medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). RET is part of the signaling pathways involving growth and development of tissues, particularly those of neural and endocrine origins. Targeted therapies that inhibit RET kinase activity are beneficial in treating cancers driven by RET mutations or fusions. Pathways impacted by RET activity also include those involved in immune response and cell cycle regulation, affecting both developmental and pathological conditions.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, the focus on RET has been predominantly on its role in cancers, particularly thyroid cancers and lung cancers. Drugs like vandetanib and cabozantinib are tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target RET and are used for treating medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) in patients harboring RET mutations. These medications can be effective based on the specific RET mutation present in the cancer, influencing treatment outcomes. Prolonged disease stabilization has been noted in patients with RET mutation-positive MTC treated with these inhibitors. Additionally, newer drugs like selpercatinib and pralsetinib specifically target RET alterations and are used for RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and MTC. Testing for RET gene alterations is recommended to guide the use of these therapies, underlining the importance of RET pharmacogenetics in personalized medicine.
