## Gene Summary
AKT1 (also known as protein kinase B alpha) is a crucial serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in diverse biological processes such as cell proliferation, growth, and survival. This gene is part of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is central to many aspects of cell biology including metabolism, growth, apoptosis, and transcription. AKT1 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, with high levels noted in tissues like the brain. Dysregulation or mutations of AKT1 have been associated with several pathological states, including cancer.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
AKT1 is implicated in several key pathways such as insulin signaling, cell survival (anti-apoptotic signals), and cancer pathways including those driving breast and prostate cancer. The gene has been associated with diseases such as Proteus syndrome and schizophrenia. Several phenotypes linked to variations or mutations in AKT1 include altered susceptibility to cancers and differences in response to drugs. In cancer, AKT1 is often found to be overactivated which promotes oncogenic processes like increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of AKT1 is particularly relevant in the context of cancer treatment. AKT inhibitors, such as ipatasertib and capivasertib, target the AKT1 signaling pathway and are used in clinical trials for treating conditions where AKT1 is dysregulated, particularly in breast cancer and other solid tumors. Understanding individual variations in the AKT1 gene can help predict responses to these therapies, providing a basis for personalized treatment strategies. Additionally, because the AKT pathway interacts with other pathways, variations in AKT1 can influence the efficacy and safety profiles of drugs that indirectly affect this pathway, further underscoring the importance of AKT1 in pharmacogenetic research.
