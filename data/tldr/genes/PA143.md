## Gene Summary
DHFR, or dihydrofolate reductase, is a gene that encodes for an enzyme critical to the metabolic processes that involve folates â€“ important molecules for synthesizing nucleic acid bases such as thymidine and purine. DHFR reduces dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, which is then used as a methyl group shuttle in the synthesis of purines, thymidylate, and other important biomolecules. This enzyme is essential for DNA and RNA synthesis, and thus, is pivotal in cell division and growth. The DHFR gene is highly conserved across species, indicating its vital role in cellular metabolism.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The activity of DHFR is crucial in the S-phase of the cell cycle, where DNA replication and cell division occur. Therefore, it is a critical target in chemotherapy, particularly in the treatment of cancer, where it is important to control the proliferation of cancer cells. Inhibition of DHFR leads to a decrease in DNA synthesis, slowing down cell division. Drugs like methotrexate, pyrimethamine, and trimethoprim target DHFR, exploiting its role in cell growth to control diseases caused by rapid cell proliferation. Pathologically, mutations in the DHFR gene can lead to megaloblastic anemia and other disorders of folate metabolism, which are critical during early embryonic development.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, the variations in the DHFR gene can influence the therapeutic outcomes of drugs targeting this enzyme. Methotrexate (MTX), a widely used chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressant drug, acts by inhibiting DHFR. The effectiveness and toxicity of methotrexate can be affected by polymorphisms in the DHFR gene. For instance, certain DHFR variants have been associated with different responses to methotrexate treatment in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and various cancers. Understanding these genetic variations allows for more tailored approaches to therapy, potentially improving efficacy and reducing adverse effects. Polymorphisms that affect folate metabolism can also alter the clinical response to antifolate drugs, necessitating adjustments in dosage and therapeutic strategy based on genetic makeup.
