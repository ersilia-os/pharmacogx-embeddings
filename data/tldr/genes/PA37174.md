## Gene Summary
UGT1A10, part of the UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 1, plays a crucial role in the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous compounds. It functions primarily in the conjugation and subsequent elimination of potentially toxic xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. This enzyme is expressed predominantly in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the colon. Structurally, UGT1A10 is part of a gene complex on chromosome 2, which involves multiple unique isoforms regulated by different promoters.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
UGT1A10 is instrumental in pharmacological pathways, involving the glucuronidation of a wide array of substances including dietary carcinogens, bile acids, hormones, and drugs. Alterations in its activity are associated with certain disease states. For instance, variations in the level of UGT1A10 expression or function can impact colorectal cancer risk, primarily through altered metabolism of potential carcinogens in the gut. The enzyme's activity also intersects with pathways relevant to drug metabolism and resistance, influencing the efficacy and toxicity of therapeutic agents.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, UGT1A10's variability plays a significant role in individual responses to drugs, particularly those undergoing glucuronidation. Drugs like irinotecan, a chemotherapy agent, are significantly affected by the activity of UGT1A10, as this enzyme aids in the detoxification of its active metabolite. Understanding genetic variations in UGT1A10 can help predict patient susceptibility to toxicity from irinotecan and possibly other drugs metabolized via glucuronidation pathways. This has implications in personalizing drug dosages to optimize therapeutic efficacy and minimize adverse effects.
