## Gene Summary
TNF, or tumor necrosis factor, is a critical cytokine involved in systemic inflammation and is part of the body's immune response. TNF is primarily produced by macrophages but can also be expressed by lymphoid cells, mast cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. The main function of TNF is to regulate immune cells, induce fever, apoptotic cell death, sepsis, and to inhibit tumorigenesis and viral replication. Dysregulated production of TNF is implicated in a variety of human diseases, including autoimmune diseases, insulin resistance, and cancer.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
TNF is a pivotal mediator in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and inflammatory bowel disease including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The gene is a key component of the cytokine signaling pathway and the NF-kappaB signaling cascade, which are essential in inflammation and immune responses. Drugs targeting TNF, known as TNF inhibitors, include infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept. These biologic drugs have revolutionized the treatment of autoimmune diseases by providing targeted therapy that reduces inflammation and halts disease progression.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of TNF is particularly significant in the context of treatment with TNF inhibitors. Variations in the TNF gene have been associated with differential responses to these drugs. For example, certain polymorphisms in the TNF gene can influence the efficacy and side effect profile of TNF inhibitors in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Genetic testing for TNF polymorphisms can help in predicting therapeutic response and personalizing treatment plans to optimize outcomes. This makes TNF not only a therapeutic target but also a genetic marker for tailoring treatment in clinical practice. Furthermore, the pharmacogenetic data suggest a correlation between TNF variants and the risk of developing infections or malignancies when on TNF inhibitor therapy, highlighting the importance of genetic assessment prior to initiating treatment with these agents.
