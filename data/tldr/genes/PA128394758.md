## Gene Summary
GLT1D1, or Glycosyltransferase 1 Domain Containing 1, encodes a protein that is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression. Specifically, GLT1D1 plays a role in glycosylation, a process vital for the proper functioning of proteins and lipids. This gene is expressed in multiple tissues in the human body.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
While there are limited detailed associations of GLT1D1 with specific drugs, diseases, or phenotypes, the gene's functions suggest it could be implicated in disorders related to glycosylation. The glycosylation process, to which GLT1D1 contributes, is crucial in multiple cellular pathways, including those related to cell-cell communication and the immune response. Dysregulation in glycosylation can lead to a broad spectrum of disorders, including congenital disorders of glycosylation and other metabolic syndromes.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there are no well-established pharmacogenetic associations specifically linked to GLT1D1. This suggests that, as of the last update, detailed impacts of variability in this gene on drug metabolism, efficacy, or toxicity have not been emphasized in the pharmacogenetics community. However, research into the broader implications of glycosylation and associated genetic components could illuminate potential pharmacogenetic applications in the future.
