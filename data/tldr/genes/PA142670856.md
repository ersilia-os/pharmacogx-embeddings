## Gene Summary
SULT1A4, also known as Sulfotransferase Family 1A Member 4, belongs to the sulfotransferase (SULT) family, which plays a key role in the metabolism of drugs, hormones, neurotransmitters, and xenobiotic compounds by sulfonation. Sulfonation is an important pathway for the elimination of many xenobiotics and endogenous compounds, as it enhances their water solubility and facilitates excretion. SULT1A4 is primarily involved in the metabolism of phenolic compounds, including a variety of small neurotransmitters and hormones. The expression profile and tissue distribution of SULT1A4 may vary, but sulfotransferases are generally found in tissues like liver, intestine, and kidney.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Although specific data on SULT1A4's involvement in diseases and phenotypes are limited compared to other SULT family members, its role in drug metabolism suggests a general impact on pharmacokinetics and potentially drug efficacy and toxicity. The activities of SULT1A4, like those of other sulfotransferases, are integral to Phase II metabolism, which is part of the body's broader capacity to process and detoxify a wide range of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. Disruptions or variations in the expression or function of SULT1A4 could influence susceptibility to adverse drug reactions or variations in drug response, particularly for medications requiring sulfonation for their metabolism.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic implications of SULT1A4 are currently not as well-characterized as those of more prominent members of the sulfotransferase family such as SULT1A1 and SULT1A3. However, given its role in the metabolism of diverse phenolic substrates, variations in SULT1A4 could potentially impact the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of drugs that undergo sulfonation. Studies on specific drug interactions and genetic polymorphisms affecting SULT1A4 activity would be pivotal for understanding its pharmacogenetic significance. This could further aid in personalized medicine by predicting individual responses to drugs, guiding dosing adjustments, and reducing adverse effects. Comprehensive research into SULT1A4-specific interactions and genetic variants is essential for elucidating its full pharmacogenetic potential.
