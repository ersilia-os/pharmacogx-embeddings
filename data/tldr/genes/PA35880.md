## Gene Summary
SLC2A5, or solute carrier family 2 member 5, encodes a facilitative glucose transporter specifically for fructose, also known as GLUT5. It is expressed predominantly in the small intestine and sperm where it plays a critical role in the absorption and metabolism of dietary fructose. SLC2A5 expression is also found in other tissues including kidney and adipose tissues. The protein facilitates the bidirectional transport of fructose across the plasma membrane, which is vital for fructose utilization by cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SLC2A5 is implicated in various metabolic processes primarily linked to fructose metabolism. Dysfunction or variations in this gene can be associated with disorders of fructose handling such as fructose malabsorption and fructosemia, which are conditions that affect the digestion and absorption of fructose leading to gastrointestinal symptoms and other metabolic disturbances. The gene is involved in pathways that regulate not only carbohydrate metabolism but also potentially influences pathways linked to metabolic syndromes, obesity, and diabetes, given its role in sugar transport and homeostasis.

## Pharmacogenetics
While direct pharmacogenetic associations involving SLC2A5 and specific drugs are not extensively documented, the gene's role in fructose transport can theoretically influence responses to dietary interventions and potentially to drugs that affect carbohydrate metabolism. Understanding variations in SLC2A5 could potentially help in tailoring dietary recommendations, especially in conditions like fructose intolerance or metabolic syndromes where fructose metabolism is disrupted. Further research may reveal more about the geneâ€™s pharmacogenetic implications in drug metabolism and efficacy, particularly concerning interventions aimed at managing metabolic conditions.
