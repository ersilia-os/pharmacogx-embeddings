## Gene Summary
HLA-G, or Human Leukocyte Antigen G, is a non-classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I gene. Unlike its classical counterparts that are widely expressed, HLA-G displays a highly restricted expression pattern, predominantly expressed in immune-privileged tissues such as the placenta, specifically by trophoblast cells, where it plays a critical role in maternal-fetal tolerance. HLA-G interacts with inhibitory receptors such as ILT2 and ILT4 on immune cells, leading to the suppression of immune responses and contributing to the acceptance of the fetus during pregnancy, as well as playing roles in autoimmune disease, transplantation tolerance, and tumor evasion.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
HLA-G is implicated in a range of clinical conditions and interactions. It has been studied extensively in the context of pregnancy, particularly regarding preeclampsia and recurrent spontaneous abortion, where its altered expression may contribute to pathogenesis. Additionally, its expression in tumors—such as melanoma, breast, and lung cancer—can enable these cells to evade immune detection and destruction. HLA-G also plays a role in transplantation immunology, influencing graft acceptance and rates of rejection. The gene is involved in multiple immune regulation pathways, highlighting its general importance in modulating immune responses under various physiological and pathological conditions.

## Pharmacogenetics
The study of pharmacogenetics in relation to HLA-G mainly focuses on its impact on transplantation outcomes and its potential in cancer immunotherapies. Variations and expression levels of HLA-G can influence the efficacy of immunosuppressive drugs used post-transplantation, potentially affecting the risk of graft rejection or acceptance. In cancer therapy, understanding the role of HLA-G can help refine approaches to increase the immunogenicity of cancer cells, potentially improving the effectiveness of checkpoint inhibitors and other immunomodulators. However, as of now, specific drug associations and standardized pharmacogenetic guidelines involving HLA-G remain under investigation and are not as well-defined as for some other pharmacogenetic targets.
