## Gene Summary
NCAM1, also known as Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule 1, is a protein-coding gene that plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of the nervous system. It is involved in cell adhesion, neurite outgrowth, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory. NCAM1 is characterized by its function in mediating cell-cell interactions via homophilic (NCAM1-NCAM1) and heterophilic (with other molecules) interactions. It is broadly expressed in the nervous system but can also be found in other tissues such as skeletal muscle and the immune system.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NCAM1 is associated with a range of neurological disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and various neurodevelopmental conditions. Its role in cell adhesion and neuronal connectivity makes it a critical player in the etiology of these disorders. NCAM1 has also been implicated in cancer, particularly in the processes of tumor progression and metastasis. In terms of pathways, NCAM1 is involved in axon guidance and synaptic transmission pathways, which are crucial for proper brain function and development.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, pharmacogenetic data specifically linking NCAM1 with drug responses are limited. However, understanding the gene's role in neurological disorders and tumor biology could inform future pharmacogenetic research, especially in the context of targeted therapies that might influence cell adhesion mechanisms or neurodevelopmental processes. Drugs targeting pathways or processes involving NCAM1 could potentially be influenced by genetic variations in this gene, though such associations need further empirical support.
