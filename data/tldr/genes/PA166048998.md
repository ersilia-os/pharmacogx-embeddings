## Gene Summary
ARHGEF28, also known as "Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 28," is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of small GTPases of the Rho family. These GTPases are key regulators of various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal dynamics, cell migration, and cell proliferation. The ARHGEF28 protein functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which plays a crucial role in activating Rho GTPases by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP. It is expressed in a variety of tissues, with notable levels in the brain and spinal cord.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ARHGEF28 has been implicated in a number of cellular signaling pathways, primarily those involving actin cytoskeleton organization and neuronal function. Although not directly linked to specific drugs or therapies as a target, its role in neurobiological processes suggests potential relevance in neurological diseases and disorders that affect cytoskeletal organization. Pathways involving ARHGEF28 include those related to Rho GTPase signal transduction, which impacts cell morphology and mobility, potentially influencing cancer metastasis and neurological disorders.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of ARHGEF28 is not extensively documented, particularly in direct associations with specific drugs. Its role in modulating the Rho GTPase pathways, however, hints at indirect implications in treatments that target these pathways or related mechanisms, such as cancer therapies targeting metastatic processes. Due to its influence on neuronal signaling and cytoskeletal rearrangements, ARHGEF28 may eventually be found to have implications in pharmacogenetic profiles affecting drug responses in neurodegenerative diseases or psychiatric conditions. Further research into ARHGEF28's specific interactions and effects could unveil more direct pharmacogenetic applications.
