## Gene Summary
CEP72, or "centrosomal protein 72," is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the centrosomal protein family. This protein plays crucial roles in the organization and function of the centrosome during the cell cycle, particularly in the regulation of centriole duplication and spindle assembly during mitosis. CEP72's expression is pivotal for proper cell cycle progression and cellular division, with its dysfunction often linked to anomalies in these processes. The geneâ€™s roles encompass fundamental cellular mechanisms integral to maintaining cellular integrity and function.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CEP72 has been implicated in various cellular pathways, including those governing cell division and mitotic spindle assembly. Its involvement extends to phenotypic manifestations primarily associated with cellular growth and proliferation. Research suggests that changes in CEP72 function or expression may contribute to certain types of cancer due to its role in cell cycle regulation. Additionally, due to its central role in cell division, CEP72 may influence the efficacy or toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents that target rapidly dividing cells.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, CEP72 is particularly notable for its association with treatment response in cancer chemotherapy. Variants within CEP72 have been studied for their impact on the toxicity and efficacy of vincristine, a common chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A specific polymorphism in CEP72, rs924607, has been associated with an increased risk of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy. This pharmacogenetic association highlights the potential of CEP72 as a biomarker for predicting adverse drug responses and tailoring cancer chemotherapy to optimize outcomes and minimize side effects.
