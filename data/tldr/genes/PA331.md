## Gene Summary
SLC22A2, also known as the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), is an integral membrane protein that functions in the renal elimination of endogenous and exogenous organic cations. It belongs to the solute carrier family and specifically, the organic cation transporter (OCT) subgroup. SLC22A2 is predominantly expressed in the kidney, specifically in the basolateral membrane of renal tubular cells. It plays a critical role in the transport of a variety of compounds including neurotransmitters, drugs, and toxic substances, utilizing an electrochemical gradient.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SLC22A2 is implicated in the pharmacokinetics and toxicity profiles of several drugs. Due to its role in renal drug clearance, variations in its function can influence the efficacy and toxicity of medications primarily excreted by the kidneys. Diseases associated with SLC22A2 include altered drug pharmacokinetics and nephrotoxicity. The protein is involved in important pathways that manage the body's chemical homeostasis, including the handling of cationic drugs and metabolites. Genetic variations in SLC22A2 can lead to phenotypic variability in drug disposition and response.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, SLC22A2 exhibits significant interactions with a variety of medications. It is involved in the transport and elimination of metformin, a widely used antidiabetic drug; decreased function of SLC22A2 can lead to increased plasma levels of metformin and thus higher drug efficacy but also risk of toxicity. Other drugs affected by SLC22A2 include the antiviral drugs acyclovir and ganciclovir, anticancer agents like oxaliplatin, and the antihistamine cimetidine. Genetic polymorphisms in SLC22A2 can alter an individual's risk for adverse drug reactions or modify drug efficacy, which is crucial for personalized medicine approaches in treating diseases like type 2 diabetes, viral infections, and cancer. Understanding these interactions helps in optimizing therapeutic strategies for improved patient safety and treatment outcomes.
