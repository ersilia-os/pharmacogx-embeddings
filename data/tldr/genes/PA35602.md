## Gene Summary
CXCL12, also known as stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), is a chemokine highly involved in the processes of hematopoiesis and angiogenesis. This gene encodes a stromal cell-derived alpha chemokine which is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues. CXCL12 primarily functions as a chemoattractant for lymphocytes, playing a crucial role in immune surveillance and response. By binding to its receptor, CXCR4, CXCL12 regulates the migration and adhesion of cells, which is vital for tissue development and repair, as well as for inflammatory responses.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CXCL12 is implicated in a variety of diseases, especially those related to immune function and cancer. Its role in cancer biology includes tumor progression and metastasis, particularly influencing the cancer cells’ environment and promoting angiogenesis. The dysregulation of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling pathway can be associated with a broad spectrum of diseases including HIV entry into cells, rheumatoid arthritis, and other inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, genetic variations in CXCL12 have been studied in association with cardiovascular diseases and susceptibility to infections, reflecting the gene’s broader role in disease modulation and immune responses.

## Pharmacogenetics
From a pharmacogenetic viewpoint, CXCL12 has garnered attention primarily in the context of cancer treatment and management of HIV. In HIV treatment, CXCR4 antagonists targeting the interaction with CXCL12 have been explored to block the entry of the virus into cells. In cancer therapy, pharmacological targeting of CXCL12/CXCR4 interactions is being explored to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. For instance, plerixafor, a CXCR4 antagonist, is used in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. However, the potential for individual variations in response to these therapies due to genetic differences in CXCL12 suggests a need for further pharmacogenetic studies to optimize therapeutic strategies based on CXCL12 genotypes.
