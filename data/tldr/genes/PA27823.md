## Gene Summary
EPHA8, or Ephrin Receptor A8, is a member of the Eph receptor tyrosine kinase family, which is important in mediating developmental events, particularly in the nervous system. The protein encoded by EPHA8 interacts predominantly with membrane-bound ephrin-A ligands, leading to cell signaling that influences cell shape, mobility, and segmentation particularly in neurodevelopmental processes. Expression of EPHA8 is primarily observed in brain tissues, although its levels and impact can vary significantly during different developmental stages.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
EPHA8's role is predominantly anchored in neurological development, influencing neural cell pattern formation and neural circuit development. Altered EPHA8 function has therefore been implicated in contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders, although direct links to specific diseases are still under exploration. Pathways involving EPHA8 typically include those that govern cell positioning and tissue boundary formation in the developing nervous system. Its expression and function can influence various phenotypical outcomes, particularly related to neural architecture and potentially the behavioral consequences thereof.

## Pharmacogenetics
Current knowledge of EPHA8 in pharmacogenetics is relatively limited compared to more extensively studied genes. There are few direct associations between EPHA8 and specific drug responses or adverse drug reactions. However, given its significant role in neural development, it is conceivable that future pharmacogenetic research may explore potential implications of EPHA8 variations in response to drugs affecting neural systems, including neurodevelopmental therapies. Further studies could help clarify whether genetic variations in EPHA8 influence drug efficacy or the risk of side effects in treatments related to neurological conditions.
