## Gene Summary
**XPNPEP2**, short for X-prolyl aminopeptidase (aminopeptidase P) 2, is a critical enzyme in the metabolism of proline-containing peptides. Primarily expressed in the kidneys, XPNPEP2 helps cleave N-terminal proline residues from peptides, playing an essential role in the processing of biologically active peptides and the overall regulation of physiological functions. The gene is located on the X chromosome, and its activity is crucial in both normal physiological regulation and specific pathological conditions.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
XPNPEP2 has been associated with a specific form of angioedema, especially angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema. This swelling condition can occur as an adverse reaction to ACE inhibitors, due to the accumulation of peptides typically metabolized by angiotensin-converting enzymes, which are impacted by the activity of XPNPEP2. Additionally, pathways involving the regulation of blood pressure and inflammatory responses also involve XPNPEP2, linking it to cardiovascular and renal diseases.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic research on XPNPEP2 primarily focuses on its role in modulating the response to ACE inhibitors, a common class of drugs used to treat hypertension and heart failure. Variants in the XPNPEP2 gene can lead to altered enzyme activity, significantly affecting drug efficacy and safety. Specifically, individuals with certain XPNPEP2 genotypes might be at a higher risk of developing ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema. This connection highlights the importance of considering genetic testing for XPNPEP2 variations when prescribing ACE inhibitors to mitigate the risk of severe adverse reactions in susceptible individuals.
