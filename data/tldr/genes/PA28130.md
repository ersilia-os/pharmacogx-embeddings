## Gene Summary
FGFR4, or Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the fibroblast growth factor receptor family, which is characterized by its tyrosine kinase activity. The FGFR4 protein is fundamentally involved in key biological processes including cell growth, differentiation, migration, and angiogenesis. FGFR4 expression is variably seen in different tissues but is most prominently expressed in lung, muscle, liver, and kidney tissues. 

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
FGFR4 has been implicated in several important signaling pathways such as the MAPK, PI3K-Akt signaling pathways, which are crucial for cell proliferation and survival. These pathways also have implications in cancer cell biology, contributing to oncogenic processes. FGFR4 is specifically associated with various forms of cancer, including rhabdomyosarcoma, liver cancer, and breast cancer. The involvement of FGFR4 in these diseases often correlates with a poor prognosis due to its role in promoting invasive and metastatic tumor properties.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, FGFR4 is notable for its implications in the efficacy and safety of targeted cancer therapies. Drugs such as BLU-9931 and rogaratinib target the FGFR family and have shown differential responses based on FGFR4 gene variations. These drugs are primarily explored in clinical settings for cancers where FGFR genetic alterations drive tumor growth, such as urothelial and lung cancers. The genetic variations in FGFR4 can alter the effectiveness of these therapies, highlighting the importance of personalized medicine approaches in oncology to maximize treatment efficacy and minimize adverse effects.
