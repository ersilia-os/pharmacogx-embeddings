## Gene Summary
UGT2B4 (UDP Glucuronosyltransferase Family 2 Member B4) is a gene encoding an enzyme that plays a critical role in the conjugation and subsequent elimination of potentially toxic xenobiotics and endogenous compounds, primarily through glucuronidation. This process attaches glucuronic acid to substances, enhancing their solubility and excretion in bile or urine. UGT2B4 is predominantly expressed in the liver, but it is also found in other tissues such as the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys. The enzyme encoded by this gene is part of the large UDP-glucuronosyltransferase family, active in the metabolism of steroids, bile acids, and a variety of other substrates.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
UGT2B4 is involved in the metabolic pathways of various drugs and environmental chemicals. Its activity influences the pharmacokinetics of specific drugs and can lead to variable responses among individuals. Alterations in the expression or function of UGT2B4 have been associated with certain liver diseases, cancers, especially hormone-dependent cancers like breast and prostate cancer, emphasizing the role of steroid metabolism in these conditions. The gene's role in drug metabolism pathways often involves conversion of lipophilic compounds into more water-soluble forms for excretion.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, UGT2B4 variability can affect the metabolism and efficacy of several drugs, contributing to interindividual differences in drug responses. Although comprehensive assessments of all drugs affected by UGT2B4 variants are ongoing, known associations include modifications in the metabolism of drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). For example, differential glucuronidation of NSAIDs by UGT2B4 may influence both therapeutic outcomes and the risk of adverse reactions like gastrointestinal bleeding. Understanding these associations helps in predicting patient-specific drug responses and can guide personalized medication strategies to optimize efficacy and minimize adverse effects.
