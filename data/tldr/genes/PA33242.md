## Gene Summary
The official symbol of the gene discussed here is **PGM1**, which stands for Phosphoglucomutase 1. PGM1 is a key enzyme in glucose metabolism that primarily functions in converting glucose-1-phosphate into glucose-6-phosphate and vice versa. This reversible reaction is critical in the pathways of glycogenolysis and glycogen synthesis, facilitating the storage and release of glucose as needed by the body. PGM1 is recognized for its ubiquity across various tissues, indicating its essential role in fundamental metabolic processes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
PGM1 is implicated in various metabolic pathways, especially those managing carbohydrate storage and mobilization. It is crucial for normal glycogen metabolism and thereby impacts energy homeostasis. Mutations in **PGM1** are associated with a rare condition known as PGM1 deficiency or Glycogen Storage Disease type XIV. This autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by an array of symptoms including hypoglycemia, muscle weakness, hepatopathy, and cardiomyopathy among others. The clinical manifestations can vary widely, but often entail issues derived from impaired glucose production and utilization.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, **PGM1** has not been heavily featured like some other metabolic enzymes concerning specific drug interactions or variations that influence drug metabolism. However, the understanding of PGM1's role in metabolic pathways can influence general therapeutic approaches, especially in managing conditions like PGM1 deficiency. There is no specific direct link between PGM1 gene variants and altered drug responses or adverse drug reactions established in the pharmacogenetics databases currently. Focus in research might include the impacts of metabolic compensations in response to therapies targeting enzymatic activity or glucose metabolism, but concrete pharmacogenetic associations with specific drugs remain to be elucidated.
