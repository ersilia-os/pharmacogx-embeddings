## Gene Summary
ADCY1 (Adenylate Cyclase 1) is a gene that encodes an enzyme involved in the generation of cyclic AMP from ATP. This enzyme is key in the second messenger system and plays a critical role in transmitting signals from receptors on the cell surface to the inside of the cell. ADCY1 is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly within regions responsible for processing olfactory signals, which suggests its specific role in the neurological response to odors.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ADCY1 is implicated in several neurological disorders due to its significant expression and role in the brain. Cyclic AMP pathways, influenced by ADCY1 activity, are crucial in various neurobiological processes including memory formation and cognitive functions. Dysregulation of these pathways can be linked to neurological diseases such as Schizophrenia and Parkinsonâ€™s disease. In terms of pathways, ADCY1 is central to the cAMP signaling pathway and is involved in G protein-coupled receptor signaling, affecting many physiological responses from smell to hormone secretion.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of ADCY1 focuses mainly on its role in influencing responses to drugs that target the cAMP pathway. While specific drug interactions are less documented compared to other pharmacogenes, drugs that influence cAMP levels might indirectly affect or be affected by the functionality of ADCY1. For instance, medications used in the treatment of chronic lung diseases and certain psychiatric disorders, which aim to modulate cAMP pathway, could potentially have varied effectiveness depending on the expression or mutation status of ADCY1. However, detailed associations regarding particular drugs remain an area for further research to establish more defined pharmacogenetic profiles.
