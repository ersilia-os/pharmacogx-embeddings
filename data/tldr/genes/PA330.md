## Gene Summary
SLC22A3, also known as the solute carrier family 22 member 3, is part of the organic cation transporter (OCT) family, specifically OCT3. This gene plays a crucial role in the transport of endogenous and exogenous organic cations, especially in tissues like the kidney, placenta, heart, and brain. SLC22A3 is also involved in the uptake and distribution of neurotransmitters and drugs across cell membranes. Its expression varies significantly across different tissues, which influences substrate accessibility and the pharmacokinetics of various compounds.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SLC22A3 is implicated in a variety of physiological and pathological conditions, due to its broad substrate specificity and tissue distribution. In pharmacology, it affects the absorption and elimination of many drugs including antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticancer drugs. This gene has also been linked with several diseases such as colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. Pathways related to SLC22A3 include those governing drug metabolism and transport, impacting the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of numerous therapeutic agents. Moreover, variants in this gene have been associated with different phenotypes, such as drug responsiveness and susceptibility to certain diseases.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of SLC22A3 is particularly notable in its modulation of drug efficacy and toxicity, especially for antidepressants like citalopram and antidiabetic agents such as metformin. Variants in SLC22A3 can alter transport function, affecting drug concentrations at their sites of action, which can ultimately impact therapeutic outcomes and adverse effects. For instance, some polymorphisms in SLC22A3 are associated with differential response to chemotherapy in cancer patients, including those receiving platinum-based therapies. Understanding these associations helps in tailoring individualized therapeutic regimens that enhance efficacy while minimizing adverse effects, showcasing the clinical importance of pharmacogenetic insights in SLC22A3.
