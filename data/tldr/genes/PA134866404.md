## Gene Summary
C6orf15, also known as "chromosome 6 open reading frame 15," is a gene located on chromosome 6. It encodes a protein of unknown function, but based on its sequence, it is predicted to have enzymatic activity. The expression of C6orf15 is observed in various tissues, although it tends to be most prominent in immune-related organs such as the spleen and lymph nodes. This suggests a potential role in the immune system or in inflammatory processes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The specific pathways involving C6orf15 have not been fully elucidated due to the currently limited understanding of the proteinâ€™s function. However, it has been suggested that aberrations in this gene could be linked to autoimmune disorders based on its expression profile and genetic associations. Initial studies indicate a potential link between polymorphisms in C6orf15 and certain autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.

## Pharmacogenetics
As of the latest understanding, there are no direct pharmacogenetic associations involving C6orf15 concerning specific drug responses or adverse drug reactions. This absence of data is primarily due to the still undefined role of the C6orf15 protein within cellular and physiological contexts. Given its potential involvement in immune system function, future studies might uncover relevant pharmacogenetic interactions, particularly in the context of drugs used to treat autoimmune diseases.
