## Gene Summary
CAPN10, or calpain 10, is a member of the calpain family of calcium-dependent cysteine proteases. These enzymes play key roles in various cellular processes by modifying the structure and function of their protein substrates. CAPN10 is expressed ubiquitously with higher levels in tissues like the liver, kidney, and muscles. The protein is involved in insulin secretion and action, and alterations in its activity have been linked to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The gene's function encompasses the modulation of cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell proliferation, and differentiation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CAPN10 is primarily associated with metabolic pathways influencing carbohydrate metabolism and insulin signaling. Disorders connected to mutations or variations in CAPN10 primarily include susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Several studies highlight the gene's involvement in glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. Other metabolic syndromes and related phenotypes have also been explored, albeit to a lesser extent. The regulation of this gene and its activity have significant implications for cellular energy homeostasis and metabolic health.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic studies involving CAPN10 mainly focus on its implications in diabetes treatment. Variants in CAPN10 have been linked to differential responses to drugs used in the management of diabetes, such as sulfonylureas, which enhance insulin secretion, and metformin, which improves insulin sensitivity. For instance, specific genetic variations in CAPN10 may predict the efficacy or risk of side effects from these medications. Such associations underscore the potential of considering CAPN10 genotype in personalized diabetes treatment plans to optimize therapeutic outcomes. Research continues to explore broader pharmacogenetic applications by examining CAPN10 involvement in other drugs and pathways.
