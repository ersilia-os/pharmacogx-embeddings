## Gene Summary
MT-ND1 (Mitochondrially Encoded NADH Dehydrogenase 1) is a gene located within the mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) and encodes one of the subunits of the enzyme Complex I (NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase), which is the first enzyme complex in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This complex is responsible for the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, which is an essential step in the process of oxidative phosphorylation. The proper functioning of MT-ND1 is critical for the generation of ATP via the gradient-driven synthesis performed by ATP synthase. MT-ND1 expression and activity are most pivotal in tissues with high energy demands such as the heart, brain, and muscles.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in MT-ND1 have been associated with several mitochondrial disorders, which affect cellular energy metabolism. Phenotypically, these mutations can manifest in a variety of ways, most commonly including Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), which is characterized by the death of retinal ganglion cells leading to blindness. Other conditions associated with mutations in this gene include mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS syndrome). Pathologically, alterations in MT-ND1 can disrupt the electron transport chain, resulting in decreased ATP production and increased ROS (reactive oxygen species) production, which in turn can contribute to cellular damage and inflammation.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic relevance of MT-ND1 mainly lies in its role influencing mitochondrial toxicity in response to various drugs, given its critical role in energy production. While specific drugs directly targeting MT-ND1's function are currently limited, understanding individual variations in MT-ND1 can help predict susceptibilities to drugs that impact mitochondrial function. Notably, antiretroviral drugs used in HIV treatment, such as Zidovudine, can cause mitochondrial toxicity whose severity might be influenced by MT-ND1 mutations. Therefore, genetic variations in this gene can potentially inform on the likely individual risks of mitochondrial disorders and drug-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, making it a candidate for consideration in personalized medicine strategies, especially in managing complex diseases with a mitochondrial component.
