## Gene Summary
CTNNA2, or Catenin Alpha 2, is a gene that encodes an alpha catenin protein which is a critical component in the cadherin-catenin complex. This complex is vital for cell-cell adhesion, influencing cellular structures and communication. CTNNA2 is primarily expressed in the brain, suggesting a significant role in neurological functions. It is involved in linking cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton, fundamental in maintaining epithelial cell integrity and orderly tissue structure.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CTNNA2 has been implicated in several neurological disorders. Research indicates associations with conditions such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and bipolar disorder. Its role in neural connectivity and synaptic functions underlies these associations, reflecting its importance in brain development and function. The protein encoded by CTNNA2 is also involved in pathways related to cell adhesion molecules, which are crucial for neuronal signaling and plasticity.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there are no direct pharmacogenetic associations involving CTNNA2 with specific drugs. However, its implication in neurological disorders might influence future pharmacogenetic research. Understanding the genetic variations within CTNNA2 could potentially lead to targeted therapies that modulate its protein interactions and functions, particularly in the context of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions. Further studies are needed to establish any direct interactions between CTNNA2 gene variants and therapeutic responses or adverse drug reactions.
