## Gene Summary
MAPT (Microtubule-Associated Protein Tau) plays a crucial role in stabilizing microtubules in axons and is essential for normal brain function. The gene is predominantly expressed in neurons, especially in the axons of the central nervous system. The tau protein, encoded by MAPT, binds to tubulin, promoting microtubule assembly and stability, and regulates the dynamics of the cytoskeleton which is vital for neuronal functioning. It is heavily involved in neuron plasticity through its interaction with microtubules.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
MAPT is notably associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal degeneration (CBD). The pathological aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein into neurofibrillary tangles is a hallmark of these conditions, particularly in AD. MAPT mutations or dysregulations lead to altered tau protein which disrupts microtubule stability and neuronal transport, contributing to disease phenotypes. In terms of pathways, the gene is involved in the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) pathway in AD.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, the focus on MAPT primarily concerns its role in the efficacy and response of treatments in neurodegenerative diseases. Studies have indicated that variations in the MAPT gene may influence the progression of diseases like Alzheimer's and could potentially impact the effectiveness of neuroprotective drugs aimed at stabilizing tau proteins. There are currently no specific drugs targeting MAPT mutations directly; however, research into anti-tau therapies, such as tau aggregation inhibitors (e.g., methylene blue derivatives) and antisense oligonucleotides, is ongoing. These developments suggest a future where MAPT pharmacogenetics could play a critical role in personalized medicine for neurodegenerative diseases.
