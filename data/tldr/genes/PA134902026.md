## Gene Summary
SORCS2, or Sortilin-related VPS10 domain containing receptor 2, is a gene implicated in the trafficking and processing of neuronal receptors. This gene encodes a protein belonging to the VPS10 domain-containing receptor family, which is broadly involved in the regulation of neuronal viability and function. The SORCS2 protein plays a crucial role in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity, impacting both neuronal communication and survival pathways. Its expression is primarily noted in the nervous system, especially in various brain regions, which aligns with its neuronal functions.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SORCS2 has been associated with several neurological and psychiatric disorders. Research indicates connections between this gene and conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. It is also studied in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders due to its role in synaptic function and plasticity. From a molecular signaling perspective, SORCS2 is involved in pathways that regulate the transport and signaling of neuronal receptors, which are crucial for maintaining proper synaptic activity and plasticity. Although not directly linked to particular drugs or therapies, its involvement in these critical pathways could make it a potential target for future pharmacological intervention.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of SORCS2 remains relatively uncharted compared to more clinically targeted genes. However, due to its implications in various neuropathologies, it holds potential for future pharmacogenetic research. Understanding the genetic variations within SORCS2 could lead to better personalized treatment strategies for the associated neurological and psychiatric disorders. Future studies could elucidate how variants in this gene affect individual responses to drugs used in the treatment of these complex conditions, potentially leading to more effective and targeted therapeutic approaches based on a patient's genetic makeup.
