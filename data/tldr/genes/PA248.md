## Gene Summary
NFKB1 (Nuclear Factor Kappa B Subunit 1) encodes a protein that is a crucial part of the NF-kappa-B complex, which is known for its significant role in regulating inflammation, immune response, cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. NFKB1 functions through the transcriptional activation of numerous genes affected by various stimuli including cytokines, free radicals, and bacterial or viral antigens. The protein exists typically in an inactive state in the cytoplasm but translocates to the nucleus upon activation, where it can bind DNA and regulate gene expression. NFKB1 is ubiquitously expressed across various tissue types.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NFKB1 is intimately involved in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, such as asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. It also plays a role in oncogenic processes and has been implicated in the development of cancers like breast cancer, lung cancer, and leukemias. The signaling pathways involving NFKB1 contribute to immune response modulation and are linked with apoptosis and cell growth regulatory mechanisms. Genetic variations in NFKB1 have been associated with differential susceptibility to these diseases and likely impact the inflammatory and immune responses.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, NFKB1 is of interest primarily due to its role in modulating inflammation and immune response, making it a potential target in therapies for autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, as well as cancer. Drugs that target the NF-kappa-B pathway, indirectly affecting NFKB1 activity, include corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Additionally, newer biological agents such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, which impact NFKB1 activity, are crucial in managing conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. The effectiveness and adverse effects of these drugs may be influenced by genetic variants in the NFKB1 gene, making it a candidate for personalized medicine approaches. Understanding individual genetic variations in NFKB1 could help predict drug response and optimize therapeutic strategies.
