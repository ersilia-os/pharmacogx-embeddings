## Gene Summary
KIRREL2 (Kin of IRRE like 2) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. The protein is involved in the formation and function of the kidney filtration barrier, interacting particularly at the slit diaphragms of podocytes, which are critical components in the kidney's ability to filter blood and produce urine. KIRREL2 has a structural role and facilitates cell-cell interactions crucial to maintaining the glomerular structure and function.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
KIRREL2 is implicated in nephrotic syndrome, a kidney disorder that causes the body to excrete excessive protein in the urine, leading to potential kidney failure and other systemic complications. This gene operates within the nephronophthisis-related ciliopathies pathway significantly involved in kidney development and disease. Alterations or mutations within KIRREL2 could lead to disruptions in podocyte function and hence influence the onset or progression of kidney diseases. Moreover, the protein's interaction with other molecules in cell adhesion may have broader implications in tissue morphogenesis and integrity beyond the renal system.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there are few direct pharmacogenetic associations specifically involving KIRREL2 and drug responses or adverse drug reactions documented in major databases or literature. However, its role in nephrotic syndrome may indirectly influence the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of medications used to treat kidney diseases, such as corticosteroids or immunosuppressants. Further exploration in pharmacogenetic studies may reveal more about potential gene-drug interactions, particularly in how variations in KIRREL2 could affect drug efficacy or safety in disorders linked to kidney function.
