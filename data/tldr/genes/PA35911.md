## Gene Summary
SLC6A5, also known as the solute carrier family 6 member 5, encodes the glycine transporter 2 protein. This gene is primarily expressed in the central nervous system. The encoded protein plays a crucial role in the reuptake of glycine, a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. The activity of this transporter is pivotal for regulating glycine levels in synaptic clefts, thus modulating inhibitory neurotransmission. SLC6A5 is particularly significant in the brainstem and spinal cord, where glycine-mediated neurotransmission is a major mechanism.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations and dysfunction of SLC6A5 are linked to hyperekplexia, a rare genetic disorder characterized by an exaggerated startle response and hypertonia. This condition illustrates the crucial role of glycine in inhibitory synapses and its broader impacts on motor control. Phenotypically, patients with alterations in SLC6A5 may also exhibit developmental delay and episodic apnea. The gene is involved in pathways related to neurotransmitter clearance in the synapse, significantly influencing synaptic transmission and neurological signaling. The importance of this protein in glycine reuptake identifies it as a potential target in disorders related to inhibitory neurotransmission.

## Pharmacogenetics
SLC6A5 has not been extensively studied in the context of direct pharmacogenetic associations with specific drugs. However, understanding its function and pathology can indirectly inform therapeutic strategies for diseases involving inhibitory neurotransmission. For conditions like hyperekplexia, strategies that modulate glycine levels or the function of glycine receptors might be influenced by the knowledge of glycine transport mechanisms mediated by SLC6A5. This could potentially extend to the use of modulators of glycinergic signaling but has not yet translated into specific pharmacogenetic guidelines involving direct drug interactions with the transporter encoded by SLC6A5.
