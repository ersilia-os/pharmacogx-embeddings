## Gene Summary
SLC22A10, known as solute carrier family 22 member 10, is part of the organic anion transporter (OAT) family. This family facilitates the transport of a variety of endogenous and exogenous organic anions, primarily in renal tubular cells. SLC22A10 is expressed predominantly in the kidney but can also be detected in other tissues albeit at lower levels. The transporter acts primarily in the renal elimination of drugs and metabolic waste products, helping to modulate their serum concentrations and effects in the body.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SLC22A10 is implicated in the physiological pathways related to the handling of organic anions in the kidney, influencing both pharmacokinetics and toxicology of various substances. The gene's expression and function may impact the development of certain renal disorders or influence the progression of conditions that are affected by the buildup of organic compounds. While specific diseases have not been predominant in literature directly linked to SLC22A10, its role in excretion could impact conditions related to toxin accumulation and drug efficacy.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of SLC22A10 have not been as extensively studied as some other solute carrier family members, but variations in this gene are thought to affect the pharmacokinetics of some drugs and thereby possibly influence therapy outcomes. For instance, the transporter's ability to affect renal clearance can alter the levels and effects of drugs excreted through this pathway. Understanding individual variations in the SLC22A10 gene could potentially lead to better dosing strategies and improved avoidance of drug toxicity, although specific drugs largely remain to be explicitly connected in clinical studies. Further research into SLC22A10â€™s pharmacogenetics could enhance personalized medicine, particularly in nephrology and pharmacology.
