## Gene Summary
ACKR1, standing for Atypical Chemokine Receptor 1, also known by its previous name DARC (Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines), is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the modulation of immune responses. This receptor, located on the surfaces of erythrocytes and endothelial cells, binds a variety of pro-inflammatory chemokines but does not initiate typical G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathways, thereby acting as a decoy receptor. ACKR1's role in clearing chemokines from circulation helps regulate inflammation and can affect the progression of various diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ACKR1 has significant implications in various diseases, primarily due to its pattern of chemokine binding. Importantly, it's known for its role in malaria, as the Plasmodium vivax parasite uses this receptor to invade red blood cells. Individuals lacking the Duffy antigen (a phenotype common in populations in Africa) are resistant to P. vivax malaria, highlighting a crucial role in infectious disease susceptibility. Additionally, ACKR1 influences tumor growth and metastasis in cancer, and has been associated with asthma and other inflammation-related conditions. It is involved in various biological pathways related to immune cell trafficking and inflammatory responses.

## Pharmacogenetics 
The pharmacogenetic aspect of ACKR1 primarily revolves around its role in modulating susceptibility and resistance to infections like malaria. Its influence on the efficacy of anti-malarial drugs and potential drug development targeting ACKR1 or its ligands is a subject of ongoing research. Given the receptorâ€™s role in chemokine sequestration, ACKR1 could also be pertinent in pharmacogenetic studies concerning drugs aimed at inflammatory diseases, where modulation of chemokine activity is beneficial. Although direct associations with specific drugs remain limited, understanding ACKR1 variation can contribute to personalized treatment strategies in diseases like cancer and inflammatory disorders.
