## Gene Summary
**GSTM4** (Glutathione S-Transferase Mu 4) belongs to the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family, specifically the mu class which is involved in the detoxification processes. These enzymes catalyze the conjugation of glutathione to a variety of exogenous and endogenous compounds, thereby neutralizing them and enhancing their excretion. GSTM4 is expressed in many tissues, with notable expression in the liver. It plays a crucial role in the detoxification of electrophilic compounds, including carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, and products of oxidative stress, through conjugation with glutathione.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
GSTM4 is implicated in several biochemical pathways primarily related to xenobiotic metabolism and response to oxidative stress. This gene is also involved in the metabolism of several drug molecules, which is crucial for understanding drug effectiveness and toxicity. Although not as extensively studied as other GST members, GSTM4's alterations and expression levels have been examined in relation to various forms of cancer, particularly in their potential role in influencing susceptibility and prognosis. It is also associated with inflammation and is expressed in various inflammatory conditions, potentially through its role in detoxifying lipid peroxidation products.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the realm of pharmacogenetics, GSTM4 has been less prominently featured compared to other GST family members such as GSTM1 or GSTP1. Nevertheless, its importance in drug metabolism pathways suggests that variations in this gene can influence the detoxification of drugs and hence their efficacy and toxicity. While specific drugs that have known interactions with GSTM4 are not well-documented, the gene's role in processing chemotherapeutic agents and anti-inflammatory drugs may be inferred given its detoxification function. Research into polymorphisms within GSTM4 could potentially lead to beneficial information regarding patient-specific drug metabolism and response profiles, although at present, such associations are not clearly established and require more expansive studies.
