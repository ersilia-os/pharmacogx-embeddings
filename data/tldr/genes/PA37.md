## Gene Summary
ADRA2C, officially known as Alpha-2C adrenergic receptor, is a protein encoded by the ADRA2C gene in humans. This gene is part of the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. These receptors play a key role in regulating neurotransmitter release from sympathetic nerves and from adrenergic neurons in the central nervous system. ADRA2C is widely expressed in the brain and in cardiovascular tissues, where it primarily acts as an inhibitor of the synaptic release of norepinephrine and thus controls vascular tone, insulin secretion, and lipolysis.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The ADRA2C receptor is involved in various physiological responses such as sedation, analgesia, inhibition of insulin release, and decreased heart rate. Dysregulation or genetic variations in this receptor have been implicated in a range of cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension and heart failure. ADRA2C also plays a role in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Due to its regulatory effects on norepinephrine release, it is also implicated in the modulation of pain response.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, the ADRA2C gene is significant owing to its influence on drug response variability, especially in the treatment of cardiovascular and psychiatric conditions. Variation in the expression or function of ADRA2C can alter an individual's response to various adrenergic and anti-adrenergic drugs. For instance, antagonists such as yohimbine, which are used for psychogenic impotence or as a research tool in autonomic pharmacology, may have varied efficacy based on ADRA2C genetic variations. Similarly, ADRA2C polymorphisms might influence the clinical effects of clonidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist prescribed for hypertension and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), potentially affecting both its efficacy and side-effect profile.
