## Gene Summary
IGF2-AS, officially known as "IGF2 antisense RNA" or often referred to as IGF2 antisense gene, is involved in the complex regulation of the insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene. IGF2 is a key growth regulatory factor in human development, and its regulation is crucial for normal growth and development. The IGF2-AS gene produces a non-coding RNA that is involved in the imprinting and regulation of IGF2 expression, primarily through mechanisms of antisense transcription and possibly by influencing the local chromatin structure. The function and expression of IGF2-AS are implicated in controlling the differential expression of the IGF2 gene.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
IGF2-AS plays a significant role in growth and metabolic pathways due to its regulatory impact on IGF2. Aberrant regulation or expression of this antisense RNA or its associated genomic imprinting might contribute to various growth disorders and metabolic diseases, such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, which is characterized by overgrowth and an increased risk of embryonal tumors. Moreover, alteration in IGF2-AS has also been studied in the context of cancer, as dysregulation of IGF2 is known to promote tumorigenesis in various tissues. The gene is also associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes pathways, showing its broader impact on metabolic regulation.

## Pharmacogenetics
In terms of pharmacogenetics, understanding the role of IGF2-AS could provide insights into individual variability in drug response, especially for treatments aimed at metabolic and growth disorders. Though direct pharmacogenetic associations with specific drugs are currently less explored and might not be widely documented, the regulatory influence IGF2-AS exerts over IGF2 suggests it could impact the efficacy and safety of drugs that target growth factors or hormonal pathways. Drugs modulating the insulin-like growth factor pathway, such as growth hormone or insulin therapies, might be influenced by alterations in IGF2-AS expression. Further research into the pharmacogenetic implications of IGF2-AS could potentially enhance personalized treatment strategies in growth-related conditions and cancers associated with IGF2 dysregulation.
