## Gene Summary
CYP4X1, officially known as cytochrome P450 family 4 subfamily X member 1, is a gene encoding an enzyme involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and endogenous fatty acids. It is part of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, which plays a vital role in the oxidation of various substances. CYP4X1 is expressed in a variety of tissues with notable levels in the brain, particularly in glial cells and neurons, suggesting specialized functions within these regions. The enzyme encoded by this gene is involved in the hydroxylation of fatty acids but also has broader substrate specificity, including potential involvement in drug metabolism.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CYP4X1, although not as extensively studied as other P450 enzymes, has been implicated in several biological pathways and disease associations. It is thought to play a role in the metabolism of retinoic acid and arachidonic acid, which are important for inflammatory responses and neurological functions. Research suggests a possible involvement of CYP4X1 in the pathogenesis of certain cancers, neurological disorders, and its potentially protective role in stroke models. The enzyme's expression patterns and activities are indicative of its participation in complex physiological and pathological processes.

## Pharmacogenetics
Despite its biological significance, the pharmacogenetics of CYP4X1 is relatively underexplored compared to other cytochrome P450 enzymes. Currently, there is limited information on direct drug interactions and mutations within CYP4X1 that significantly alter drug response in humans. However, given its role in fatty acid metabolism and potential influence on lipid soluble drugs, further studies could unveil important pharmacogenetic associations. The insights into CYP4X1â€™s activity could aid in understanding individual variations in drug metabolism, especially for drugs acting within the central nervous system or those involving inflammatory pathways.
