## Gene Summary
FMO1, or Flavin Containing Monooxygenase 1, is part of the FMO enzyme family responsible for metabolizing xenobiotics, drugs, and endogenous substrates through the oxidation of nucleophilic nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, and selenium atoms in a variety of compounds. FMO1 is predominantly expressed in the liver during fetal development but markedly decreases postnatally. The expression and activity levels vary between different populations and individuals, attributed to genetic variability and environmental factors.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
FMO1 plays a role in the metabolic pathways involved in drug metabolism, particularly in oxidizing soft nucleophiles, which makes it important in the phase I metabolism of a variety of drugs and xenobiotics. The enzyme has been studied less extensively than other members of the FMO family, such as FMO3, but it's known to metabolize several therapeutic agents when expressed. There are no specific diseases known to be directly caused by FMO1 dysfunction, but its role in drug metabolism can influence drug efficacy and toxicity.

## Pharmacogenetics
FMO1's pharmacogenetics is less characterized compared to other members of the FMO family; however, it plays a role in the metabolism of certain drugs. This metabolism can affect both the efficacy and toxicity of medications, potentially modifying therapeutic outcomes. Variation in the FMO1 gene can lead to altered enzyme activity which impacts drug response, particularly in neonates and populations with specific genetic backgrounds. Detailed pharmacogenetic profiling of FMO1 could aid in understanding individual differences in drug metabolism and contribute to personalized medication strategies, although currently, specific drug associations are not extensively documented.
