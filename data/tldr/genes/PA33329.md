## Gene Summary
PIP5K1C, also known as Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase type 1 gamma, is a gene that encodes for an enzyme crucial in the phosphoinositide signaling pathways. Specifically, it catalyzes the production of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) from phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. This lipid signaling molecule (PI(4,5)P2) is essential for various cellular processes, including regulation of membrane trafficking, actin cytoskeleton organization, and cell signaling. PIP5K1C is widely expressed in many tissues with particularly high expression levels in the brain, where it plays a critical role in synaptic function and nerve transmission.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The activity of the PIP5K1C enzyme influences numerous signaling pathways and cellular functions, thus implicating it in various neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. Dysregulation of PI(4,5)P2 levels has been linked to diseases such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The gene's product is involved in pathways regulating membrane trafficking (such as endocytosis) and the actin cytoskeleton, impacting cellular morphology and motility. In addition, PIP5K1C has been associated with insulin signaling and cardiovascular functioning, reflecting its broad biological significance.

## Pharmacogenetics
As of the current understanding, there is limited specific pharmacogenetic information available about the direct influence of PIP5K1C variants on drug response. However, given its role in neural signaling pathways, it is plausible that genetic variations in PIP5K1C could influence the efficacy and safety of drugs used in treating neurological and psychiatric conditions. Specific drugs or classes of drugs have not been definitively linked to genetic variants in PIP5K1C, but ongoing research might reveal important associations that could lead to more tailored therapeutic strategies for conditions like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, based on one's genetic makeup.
