## Gene Summary
ANKK1 (Ankyrin Repeat and Kinase Domain Containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein possessing both ankyrin repeat and kinase domains. This protein is closely associated with the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) gene and is known to be involved in signal transduction pathways. ANKK1 is primarily expressed in the brain and other tissues like the kidney and liver, suggesting roles in various cellular functions. Notably, ANKK1 has been implicated in the modulation of neural signaling processes that influence behavior, thereby highlighting its importance in neurological contexts.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ANKK1 is linked to several neuropsychiatric disorders, predominantly due to its influence on dopamine pathways. Genetic variations in ANKK1, particularly the Taq1A polymorphism, have been associated with addictive behaviors, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia. These associations stem from the gene's impact on dopamine receptor functioning, which is crucial in the regulation of mood, reward, and executive functions. In drug research, ANKK1 plays a role in the understanding of patient responses to antipsychotic medications. The pathways involving ANKK1 are primarily focused on neural signal transduction and modulation of dopamine receptor activities.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the realm of pharmacogenetics, ANKK1 has been extensively studied for its interactions with antipsychotic drugs, particularly those used in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The Taq1A polymorphism of ANKK1, a well-characterized genetic variant, has been shown to affect patient responses to these medications. Patients with different genotypes of this polymorphism may experience variations in drug efficacy and side effects, leading to personalized approaches in prescribing practices. Additionally, variations in ANKK1 are examined for their potential to predict the likelihood of developing side effects like tardive dyskinesia from antipsychotic use. The gene's pharmacogenetic associations provide critical insights that can be used to optimize therapeutic strategies and enhance the effectiveness of treatment in neuropsychiatric conditions.
