## Gene Summary
NR1I2, also known as the nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 2, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the NR1I2 gene. It is more commonly known as the pregnane X receptor (PXR). NR1I2 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of several genes, including those involved in drug metabolism and transport. It primarily functions in the liver and intestines where it senses the presence of foreign substances and subsequently induces the expression of proteins that metabolize and eliminate these substances. NR1I2 plays a critical role in protecting the body from toxic compounds and is also involved in lipid metabolism.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NR1I2 is involved in the regulation of several critical pathways, including those for drug metabolism and the clearance of xenobiotics through the induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), particularly CYP3A4. It is also instrumental in the regulation of other important drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters like UGT1A1 and MDR1. The activation of NR1I2 influences the pharmacokinetics of a wide range of drugs and can lead to significant drug-drug interactions. Perturbations in NR1I2 function or expression are linked to variations in the metabolism of xenobiotics, which can affect drug efficacy and toxicity, potentially contributing to the phenotypic variability in drug response and disease susceptibility.

## Pharmacogenetics
NR1I2 is significantly relevant in pharmacogenetics, as its activation can induce the metabolism of various pharmaceuticals, influencing their efficacy and safety profiles. Drugs that are known activators of NR1I2 include rifampin and St. John’s Wort, which can lead to reduced plasma levels and diminished efficacy of concurrently administered drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, such as statins, immunosuppressants, and certain antiretrovirals. Conversely, inhibition of NR1I2 can result in increased plasma levels of drugs, leading to potential toxicity. Genetic polymorphisms within NR1I2 can alter the receptor’s activity or drug binding affinity, impacting drug metabolism rates and outcomes. For instance, certain NR1I2 variants are associated with altered responses to drugs like warfarin and cyclophosphamide. Thus, understanding NR1I2 genetics can aid in optimizing drug dosages to enhance therapeutic efficacy and reduce adverse effects for individual patients.
