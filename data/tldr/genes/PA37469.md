## Gene Summary
ZNF100, or Zinc Finger Protein 100, is a member of the zinc finger protein family, which is one of the largest families of transcription factors in humans. The proteins in this family bind DNA through zinc finger motifs and are involved in various cellular processes including differentiation, development, and metabolism. ZNF100 is expressed in various tissues, although its expression level and functional implications may vary. Like other zinc finger proteins, ZNF100 is presumed to interact with DNA and influence the transcription of specific genes, but the detailed mechanisms and target genes of ZNF100 are less characterized compared to more studied zinc finger proteins.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
As of the latest information, there is not a significant amount of detailed research linking ZNF100 directly to specific drugs, diseases, or pathways. Zinc finger proteins, broadly, have been implicated in developmental processes and disorders, as well as in cancer, but specific data for ZNF100 is sparse. It has not been prominently highlighted in major disease associations or phenotypic abnormalities in model organisms or clinical studies, although its role cannot be fully excluded in complex genetic interaction networks.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, there is currently limited information available specifically concerning ZNF100. Unlike some other zinc finger proteins, ZNF100 has not been directly associated with variations in drug response or toxicity. Most pharmacogenetic studies typically focus on genes directly involved in drug metabolism (like cytochrome P450 enzymes), drug transporters, or specific target genes of therapeutic agents. As research continues to evolve, the potential for discovering pharmacogenetic relevance of ZNF100 may increase, especially if its gene regulatory roles become better understood in the context of disease pathogenesis or therapeutic target pathways.
