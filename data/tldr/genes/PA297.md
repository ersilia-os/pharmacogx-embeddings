## Gene Summary
The REN gene encodes renin, an enzyme critical to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which regulates blood pressure, electrolyte balance, and fluid homeostasis. REN is synthesized as preprorenin and processed to prorenin, which is either secreted directly into the bloodstream or further processed to active renin. Active renin cleaves angiotensinogen to produce angiotensin I, which is further converted into angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. REN is primarily expressed in juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney but also found in other tissues, including the brain and adrenal gland.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Alterations in REN activity and the renin-angiotensin system can lead to various cardiovascular and renal disorders. Hypertension is the most prominently associated condition with dysregulation of REN expression or function. Genetic variations in REN can also contribute to susceptibility to hypertensive disease, diabetic nephropathy, and chronic kidney disease. The pathways involving REN include not only the classic renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway but also broader cardiovascular regulatory networks that affect vessel tone and sodium balance.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, the REN gene's variations can influence the effectiveness and side effects of several cardiovascular drugs, particularly those targeting the renin-angiotensin system such as ACE inhibitors (e.g., lisinopril, enalapril) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) such as losartan and valsartan. For instance, certain polymorphisms in REN have been associated with differential blood pressure responses to these therapies. Monitoring and potentially adapting therapeutic strategies based on REN genotype might enhance treatment efficacy and reduce adverse effects, thereby personalizing treatment plans in hypertensive patients.
