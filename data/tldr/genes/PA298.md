## Gene Summary
**RRM1** (Ribonucleotide Reductase Catalytic Subunit M1) encodes the M1 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, which is crucial for DNA synthesis. RRM1 is a key player in the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides, an essential process for DNA replication and repair. The enzyme consists of two subunits: RRM1 provides the catalytic function, and a smaller subunit (RRM2 or RRM2B) that helps modulate activity. Expression of RRM1 is highest in proliferating cells, reflecting its fundamental role in DNA synthesis. RRM1 expression varies across different tissues, being particularly notable in rapidly dividing cells such as those found in bone marrow and certain tumors.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
RRM1 is implicated in several pathways, primarily those relating to nucleotide metabolism and the DNA damage response. Its function impacts the effectiveness and toxicity of certain chemotherapeutic agents, particularly in cancers like non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). High expression levels of RRM1 have been associated with resistance to drugs that target DNA replication and repair mechanisms, influencing treatment outcomes in oncology. Diseases such as pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, and various other carcinoma types have shown aberrations in RRM1 expression or activity, suggesting its role in tumor progression and chemoresistance.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of RRM1 mainly concerns its influence on chemotherapy efficacy in cancer treatment. Higher RRM1 expression has been associated with resistance to gemcitabine, a nucleoside analog used to treat several cancers including pancreatic, breast, ovarian, and NSCLC. In NSCLC, for instance, low RRM1 expression is a predictor of improved survival and enhanced responsiveness to gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. Genetic variants within the RRM1 gene can affect mRNA stability and protein expression, subsequently altering drug efficacy and patient outcomes. Personalized cancer therapy, therefore, sometimes involves testing RRM1 levels to tailor treatment plans, optimizing the use of gemcitabine and potentially other related chemotherapeutic agents.
