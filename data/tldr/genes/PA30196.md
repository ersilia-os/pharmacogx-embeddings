## Gene Summary
KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) is a proto-oncogene that encodes a protein belonging to the small GTPase superfamily. This protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell division, cell differentiation, and cell growth. KRAS is one of the most commonly mutated genes in cancer; such mutations lead to an aberrantly active form that can contribute to uncontrolled proliferation and the development of tumors. It is predominantly expressed in a variety of tissues including lung, colon, and pancreas.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
KRAS mutations are a hallmark of several types of cancers, most notably colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These mutations generally result in the constitutive activation of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, promoting oncogenesis and tumor maintenance. Understanding KRAS pathways is crucial for targeted cancer therapies. Phenotypically, KRAS mutations are associated with poor prognosis and resistance to various chemotherapeutic agents. Research on KRAS also touches on developmental disorders when considering its function in cell growth and differentiation.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, KRAS mutations predominantly influence treatment strategies and drug efficacy in cancer therapy. For instance, in colorectal cancer, patients with KRAS mutations do not benefit from therapies that target the EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), such as cetuximab and panitumumab, due to the downstream activation of the signaling pathway by mutant KRAS irrespective of EGFR inhibition. This has led to the routine testing of KRAS mutation status in these patients to guide treatment decisions. Drug development efforts in targeting mutant KRAS, like the G12C inhibitors (e.g., sotorasib), are ongoing and represent a significant area of clinical research aimed at directly antagonizing KRAS-driven malignancies.
