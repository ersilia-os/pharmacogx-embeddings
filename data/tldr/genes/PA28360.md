## Gene Summary
MTOR, officially known as the mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase, plays a central role in regulating cell growth, proliferation, survival, and protein synthesis. It integrates signals from nutrients, energy status, and growth factors to regulate important cellular processes. This protein is a core component of two distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, each having different substrates and functions. mTORC1 is sensitive to the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin, while mTORC2 is mostly rapamycin-insensitive. MTOR is widely expressed across various tissues, with critical implications in cellular and physiological processes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
MTOR is involved in several key pathways including insulin signaling, PI3K-AKT signaling, and autophagy. The gene has significant implications in medical conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders, due to its role in cell growth and metabolism. In oncology, aberrations in the MTOR pathway are linked to the development and progression of tumors, particularly in breast, prostate, and lung cancers. MTOR inhibitors, including rapamycin (sirolimus) and its analogs (everolimus, temsirolimus), are utilized in treating certain cancer types and preventing organ transplant rejection.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of MTOR is particularly relevant in the context of cancer therapy and transplant medicine. Variations in the MTOR gene can influence the efficacy and toxicity profile of mTOR inhibitors. For example, specific polymorphisms in MTOR have been associated with differential responses to everolimus and sirolimus in cancer patients and transplant recipients. There's ongoing research to better understand how genetic variations in MTOR could be employed to personalize therapy, aiming to maximize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing adverse effects. This research has the potential to enhance treatment outcomes by tailoring drug choices and dosages to individual genetic profiles.
