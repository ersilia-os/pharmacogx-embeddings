## Gene Summary
TSPAN5, or Tetraspanin-5, belongs to the tetraspanin family, characterized by four transmembrane domains. This gene is broadly involved in cell signaling, proliferation, and motility, playing crucial roles in the formation of cell membranesâ€™ specific microdomains. TSPAN5 is expressed in various tissues but is notably significant in the brain, influencing neurodevelopmental processes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Tetraspanins like TSPAN5 are integral in multiple biological pathways, including signal transduction and the regulation of cell development, possibly implicating them in diseases such as cancer and neurological disorders. While direct associations between TSPAN5 and specific diseases or drugs are not extensively documented, the family's interaction with cell signaling pathways suggests potential relevance in therapeutic targets and biomarker identification in diseases including neurodevelopmental disorders and cancers.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic studies involving TSPAN5 are not widely available in current literature, indicating that this gene is not yet a prominent focus in the pharmacogenetics field. Future research could reveal significant associations of TSPAN5 genetic variants with drug efficacy, safety profiles, or patient responses, especially in the context of neurological conditions and cancers, given its role in significant cellular processes. For now, its pharmacogenetic implications remain largely speculative but potentially promising based on its biological functions and involvement in disease-relevant pathways.
