## Gene Summary
OTOS, short for otospiralin, is primarily expressed in the inner ear, specifically in cells known as fibrocytes located within the cochlear spiral ligament and spiral limbus. The function of the OTOS gene is not entirely clear, but it is believed to play a role in the structural integrity and function of the inner ear. Given its expression profile, OTOS is considered critical for normal hearing processes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in the OTOS gene are linked to non-syndromic hearing impairment, particularly autosomal recessive deafness, type 29 (DFNB29), which is characterized by a moderate to profound sensorineural hearing loss from birth. The gene does not have major implications in pharmacology or known associations with specific drugs or broader metabolic or signaling pathways outside of its involvement in hearing and ear structure.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic associations involving the OTOS gene are minimal as it is mostly related to structural and developmental roles in the auditory system rather than metabolic or drug-response pathways. As a result, OTOS has not been significantly linked to variations in drug action, drug metabolism, or drug-induced ototoxicity, which is more frequently associated with genes involved in drug metabolism enzymes or specific drug transporters. Therefore, its consideration in pharmacogenetic profiling is primarily of interest in the context of genetic predisposition to hearing impairment rather than drug response variations.
