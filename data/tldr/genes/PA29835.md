## Gene Summary
IL6R, or interleukin 6 receptor, is a gene that encodes the IL-6 receptor protein which is a part of the immune and inflammatory response pathway. IL6R specifically binds to the cytokine IL-6 and mediates its effects. This receptor can exist in both membrane-bound and soluble forms. Primarily, the action through IL6R involves modulation of immune response, acute phase response, and inflammation. The gene is expressed in various tissues but shows higher expression in immune cells. The interaction of IL-6 with IL6R is crucial for various cellular processes including cell growth, survival, and differentiation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
IL6R plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of several chronic inflammatory diseases and conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease. The activation of this receptor leads to the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, instrumental in propagating the cytokine's effects on target cells. In diseases, overactivation of this pathway typically results in chronic inflammation and autoimmune phenomena. Pharmacologically, the manipulation of IL6R is targeted to treat these immune-mediated conditions. Blocking IL6R has been shown to reduce inflammation and alleviate disease symptoms effectively.

## Pharmacogenetics
IL6R pharmacogenetics primarily revolves around its role in the efficacy and safety of drugs targeting the IL-6 signaling pathway. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL6R, is widely used in the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. The response to tocilizumab can vary based on genetic differences in the IL6R gene among individuals, affecting drug efficacy and risk of adverse events. Genetic variants of IL6R, such as rs2228145 (a missense mutation), have been associated with differential responses to tocilizumab. This highlights the potential for pharmacogenetic testing to predict treatment outcomes and personalize therapy plans for better management of inflammatory diseases.
