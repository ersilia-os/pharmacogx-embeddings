## Gene Summary
AGBL4 (ATP/GTP binding protein-like 4), also known as CCP4 or C6orf110, is a gene expressed predominantly in the human brain, with particular emphasis in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The protein encoded by AGBL4 is a member of the cytosolic carboxypeptidase family, which plays a role in the modification of tubulin, the main constituent of microtubules. This involves the removal of glutamate residues from the tubulin C-terminal tail, which is critical for microtubule dynamics and function. AGBL4's enzymatic activity influences neuronal function and development.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Currently, research on AGBL4 is relatively limited, and direct associations with specific drugs or diseases have not been robustly established. However, given its role in the brain and involvement with microtubule dynamics, it is plausible that abnormalities in this gene could be linked to neurological conditions. The gene might influence phenotypes related to the nervous system development or neurodegenerative diseases indirectly via its role in modifying neuronal microtubules. As a part of tubulin modification, it could potentially interact with pathways related to microtubule-based processes such as cell division, intracellular transportation, and cellular morphology.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is currently limited information available on the pharmacogenetics of AGBL4. No specific drugs have been directly associated with genetic variants of this gene in pharmacogenomic studies. However, understanding the role of AGBL4 in tubulin modification and microtubule stability suggests potential implications for response to treatments affecting microtubule dynamics, such as antimitotic agents used in cancer therapy. Future research could explore associations between AGBL4 polymorphisms and variability in treatment outcomes with such medications. As pharmacogenetic knowledge expands, identifying how variations in AGBL4 affect drug response could prove significant in personalized medicine, particularly for neurological and psychiatric conditions.
