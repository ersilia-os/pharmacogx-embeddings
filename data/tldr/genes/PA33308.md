## Gene Summary
PIK3CA stands for phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha. This gene plays a pivotal role in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is crucial for many cellular processes including metabolism, growth, cell survival, and proliferation. PIK3CA encodes the p110Î± protein, a subunit of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) enzyme, which is activated by receptor tyrosine kinases and involves in the conversion of PIP2 to PIP3. This leads to the activation of AKT and subsequent modulation of various downstream targets involved in cell survival and growth. PIK3CA is expressed in various tissues but has significant implications in tissues with high regenerative or proliferative rates such as the liver and cancer cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
PIK3CA mutations are heavily implicated in the oncogenesis of numerous cancers, including breast, colon, and endometrial cancer. These mutations often lead to an increase in PI3K signaling, promoting cell proliferation and survival. The gene is a key component of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which has been targeted for cancer therapy. Inhibition of PI3KA and its pathway is a strategy in targeted therapies, using specific inhibitors like alpelisib, which is approved for breast cancer treatment. Additionally, aberrations in this gene have been associated with disorders such as PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS), characterized by overgrowths and vascular malformations in different parts of the body.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of PIK3CA is particularly relevant in the context of cancer treatment. The presence of certain PIK3CA mutations can influence the effectiveness and outcome of targeted and other chemotherapeutic treatments. For instance, alpelisib, a PI3K inhibitor, has shown effectiveness specifically in breast cancer patients harboring PIK3CA mutations. The drug is significantly less effective in patients without these mutations. Moreover, everolimus, another mTOR pathway inhibitor, has been employed in various cancers and its effectiveness can also be contingent on the PIK3CA mutation status. Knowing the PIK3CA mutation status helps tailor treatment plans in oncology, ensuring personalized therapy approaches tailored to genetic profiles, potentially leading to better outcomes and minimized toxicity. Understanding these genetic interactions is crucial for optimizing treatment efficacy in oncology.
