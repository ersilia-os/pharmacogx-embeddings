## Gene Summary
CCDC148, or Coiled-Coil Domain Containing 148, is a gene that is not extensively characterized in terms of its specific biological functions. It encodes a protein that contains a coiled-coil domain, which often suggests a role in protein-protein interactions typically involved in the structural organization of various cellular components. The expression patterns and detailed functional implications of CCDC148 remain somewhat unclear, with limited direct studies addressing its role in cellular processes or disease mechanisms.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
There is limited information on CCDC148 in relation to direct drug interactions, specific diseases, or clinical phenotypes. Similarly, its involvement in particular biochemical pathways has not been robustly documented. This lack of detailed association data can be attributed to the relatively lesser focus on this gene in biomedical research, compared to well-studied genes with clear links to human health. Current knowledge does not strongly connect CCDC148 to specific pathologies or therapeutic contexts.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of CCDC148 is not well-established, with no significant associations documented between its variation and differential drug responses or adverse drug reactions. Given the current state of knowledge, CCDC148 is not highlighted in the context of pharmacogenetic testing or in guides related to drug prescriptions influenced by genetic factors. Research in the future may uncover relevant pharmacogenetic features as more comprehensive genomic studies are conducted.
