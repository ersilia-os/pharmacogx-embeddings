## Gene Summary
TPP1, also known as tripeptidyl peptidase 1, is an enzyme that is encoded by the TPP1 gene in humans. It functions chiefly as an exopeptidase that removes tripeptides from the N-terminus of proteins, playing a critical role in the lysosome's protein degradation pathway. TPP1 is widely expressed in various tissues but shows higher activity levels in the central nervous system. Mutations in this gene are primarily linked with the neurodegenerative disorder, late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN2 disease), which is characterized by the accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigments in neurons and other cell types.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
TPP1 is associated with late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (LINCL), a severe neurodegenerative condition that manifests typically between 2 and 4 years of age. Patients with this disorder generally show symptoms such as seizures, mental and motor deterioration, and possible blindness, leading to premature death usually by the age of 10 to 15 years. From a biological pathway perspective, TPP1 is involved in lysosomal degradation pathways, crucial for the breakdown and recycling of proteins within cells. Impairments in these pathways due to faulty TPP1 can lead to the accumulation of proteinaceous deposits, contributing significantly to the pathogenesis of CLN2 disease.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, the TPP1 gene is not typically associated with variation in drug response. However, its deficiency due to genetic mutations highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), using recombinant human TPP1 protein (Cerliponase alfa), has been developed and approved for the treatment of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 2 (CLN2), also known as tripeptidyl peptidase-1 deficiency. This treatment has shown to slow the progression of the disease significantly, underscoring the importance of genetic knowledge of TPP1 in clinical settings to identify suitable candidates for this therapy.
