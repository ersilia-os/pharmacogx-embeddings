## Gene Summary
GBP6, or Guanylate Binding Protein 6, is a member of the guanylate-binding protein (GBP) family, which is part of the larger GTPase superfamily. These proteins are involved in a variety of cellular processes including cell signaling, proliferation, and immune responses. GBPs, including GBP6, are particularly known for their role in immune responses against microbial and viral pathogens. GBP6 is expressed in a variety of tissues but is notably upregulated in response to interferons, which are cytokines critical for antiviral defense.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
GBP6 is significantly implicated in the immune response pathways, especially in the context of viral infections. It is believed to play a role in the body's defense mechanism against intracellular pathogens, including viruses. While specific diseases directly linked to GBP6 are not extensively documented, its function suggests involvement in viral infectious diseases and possibly autoimmune or inflammatory disorders. The protein is involved in pathways related to interferon signaling and modulation of the immune system.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of GBP6 is not extensively studied as of the last updated research and knowledge bases. No direct pharmacogenetic associations with specific drugs have been robustly established. However, given GBP6's role in immune response pathways and interferon signaling, it could potentially influence the effectiveness or adverse responses to antiviral and immunomodulatory drugs. Research in this area could provide valuable insights into personalized treatment strategies for infectious and inflammatory diseases. Further pharmacogenetic investigations are required to understand its potential role in drug response and resistance mechanisms.
