## Gene Summary
CDH15, or Cadherin 15, is a member of the cadherin superfamily, which plays a crucial role in mediating calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion in various tissues. CDH15 is particularly important in muscle tissues where it contributes to the formation and maintenance of adherens junctions in muscle cells, supporting muscle integrity and function. It is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle, and it has also been implicated in the development the nervous system, influencing neurite outgrowth and synaptic formation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CDH15 has been associated with various muscle-related diseases due to its critical role in muscle cell adhesion and maintenance. Disorders such as congenital muscular dystrophies and some forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy may involve dysfunction of CDH15. Phenotypically, mutations or disruptions in CDH15 expression can lead to muscle weakness, impaired motor function, and developmental delays. In terms of pathways, CDH15 is significant in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is involved in the regulation of muscle development and regeneration, as well as in various processes in neural development.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, the pharmacogenetic associations of CDH15 are not extensively documented. Research into the gene primarily focuses on its role in muscle and neural development rather than direct interactions with specific drugs. However, understanding the function and pathology related to CDH15 can contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies aiming to mitigate muscle deterioration in muscular dystrophies or enhance muscle repair and regeneration. Future pharmacogenetic research may explore potential modifiers of CDH15 expression or function that could be targeted by specific drugs, particularly in the context of muscle and neurodevelopmental disorders.
