## Gene Summary
ADRB3, or Beta-3 adrenergic receptor, is a protein-coding gene that belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors known for being involved in the catecholamine hormone regulation of physiological processes. The primary role of ADRB3 is to mediate lipolysis in adipose tissue, as well as to influence thermogenesis and energy balance within the body. It's mainly expressed in adipose tissue but can also be found in the bladder and in small quantities in other tissues.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ADRB3 is associated with various metabolic and cardiovascular disorders, reflecting its function in energy regulation and vasodilation. Diseases linked with ADRB3 include obesity, noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. From a physiological perspective, variants in this gene are correlated with variations in body mass index (BMI) and metabolic efficiency. Furthermore, ADRB3 is part of important signaling pathways like the G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, interacting with key metabolic regulators such as cyclic AMP.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, ADRB3 holds significant interest due to its implications in drug responses for cardiovascular and metabolic conditions. Particular polymorphisms in ADRB3 have been studied in relation to the efficacy and metabolic response to Î²-3 adrenergic receptor agonists, used in the treatment of conditions such as overactive bladder and obesity. For instance, the Trp64Arg variant of ADRB3 has been linked to altered responses to these drugs, influencing drug dosing and therapeutic effectiveness. Understanding these genetic variations can guide more personalized approaches in the treatment, considering individual genetic backgrounds to optimize drug efficacy and reduce adverse effects.
