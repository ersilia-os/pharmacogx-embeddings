## Gene Summary
STIM1 (Stromal Interaction Molecule 1) is a gene that encodes a protein essential for calcium signaling in cells. It acts as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium sensor and is crucial for the activation of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). Upon depletion of calcium in the ER, STIM1 undergoes a conformational change, aggregates, and translocates towards the plasma membrane. Here, it interacts with Orai channels, triggering calcium influx essential for various cellular functions, including muscle contraction, gene expression, and cell growth.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
STIM1 is implicated in several pathways related to immune response, development, and cellular stress handling, primarily through its role in calcium homeostasis. Alterations in STIM1 are associated with diseases such as Immunodeficiency 10 (IMD10), which is characterized by recurrent infections and autoimmunity due to poor lymphocyte activation. It also plays a role in muscle development and function, and mutations can lead to conditions like myopathy and tubular aggregate myopathy, which involve muscle weakness and fatigue.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of STIM1 primarily revolves around its impact on diseases rather than direct interactions with drugs. However, understanding the role of STIM1 in calcium signaling can influence the development and use of drugs that target calcium channels and related pathways. Drugs affecting calcium flux in cells, such as calcium channel blockers, could potentially be impacted by genetic variations in STIM1, affecting their efficacy and safety. Future research may further clarify specific drug-gene interactions and help in personalizing treatments for conditions related to abnormal calcium signaling.
