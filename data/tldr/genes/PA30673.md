## Gene Summary
MC1R, the official symbol for Melanocortin 1 Receptor, is a gene encoding a protein that functions as a receptor for alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (Î±-MSH). This receptor is a key regulator of pigment production in mammals, influencing the type and amount of melanin produced by melanocytes in the skin and hair. Activation of the MC1R leads to the production of eumelanin (dark pigment), whereas its reduced function is associated with increased pheomelanin (light pigment) and lighter skin and hair colors. MC1R expression is primarily localized in skin and hair follicles.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
MC1R is significantly associated with skin and hair phenotypes, particularly with red hair color and light skin, traits that carry a higher risk for developing skin cancer, including melanoma and basal cell carcinoma. The gene is involved in the pigmentation signaling pathway. Its variation can lead to alterations in this pathway influencing pigmentation diseases and potentially affecting vitamin D synthesis due to reduced natural UV protection from lower melanin production. The gene plays a role in inflammatory response regulation and has been implicated in obesity-related insulin resistance.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic research on MC1R has primarily focused on its association with skin cancer risk and response to drugs used in cancer treatment. Known genetic variations in MC1R contribute to varying responses to chemotherapy drugs such as dacarbazine used in melanoma treatment. Variants of MC1R also influence the effectiveness and side effects of certain other oncologic agents. Understanding MC1R genetic variations facilitates personalized approaches in dermatology and oncology, tailoring prevention strategies and treatments based on individual genetic makeup to optimize efficacy and minimize adverse effects.
