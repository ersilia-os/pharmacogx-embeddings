## Gene Summary
ABCC1, or ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 1, is a member of the C subfamily of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. This gene plays a crucial role in cellular detoxification and multi-drug resistance phenomena. ABCC1 functions as an efflux transporter broadly expressed in various tissues including the liver, kidney, intestine, and at the blood-brain barrier. Its primary role involves transporting a variety of organic anions and drugs out of cells, utilizing the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis. The protein encoded by this gene is also implicated in the transport of glutathione and glucuronide conjugates, which are critical for the detoxification processes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ABCC1 is associated with drug resistance, particularly in the context of cancer chemotherapy. It has been found to contribute to the acquired resistance against a wide range of anticancer drugs including anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids, and taxanes. The gene is also relevant in pathophysiological conditions such as inflammatory disorders due to its role in mediating the transport of inflammatory mediators. For example, overexpression of ABCC1 in certain cancers and leukemias correlates with poor patient prognosis due to its role in drug efflux and resistance to chemotherapy. The protein is also involved in various signaling pathways linked to cellular detox processes and resistance mechanisms.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of ABCC1 is largely centered around its role in mediating drug resistance, which is particularly significant in the field of oncology. Mutations and polymorphisms in ABCC1 can influence patient responses to chemotherapy drugs. For instance, certain variants have been associated with altered transport activity for drugs like irinotecan, a key therapeutic agent in colorectal cancer, potentially impacting drug efficacy and toxicity. Furthermore, ABCC1 interactions with drugs like doxorubicin and mitoxantrone have shown clinical implications in terms of drug clearance and resistance. Genetic variation in ABCC1 can, therefore, have valuable predictive value for treatment outcomes in cancer therapy, providing possible avenues for personalizing treatment strategies based on individual genetic profiles.
