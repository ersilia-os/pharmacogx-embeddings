## Gene Summary
HLA-DRB4 (Human Leukocyte Antigen DR Beta 4) is one of the genes in the HLA system, which is crucial in the immune system's function, particularly in antigen presentation. The gene encodes for one of the chains of the HLA-DR protein, specifically a beta chain, which pairs with an alpha chain to form the heterodimeric DR molecule. HLA-DR molecules are expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells and play a significant role in the initiation of T-cell immune responses by presenting peptide fragments to T cells. Expression of HLA-DRB4 can be variable among individuals, and it is primarily implicated in immune response modulation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
HLA-DRB4 is not directly linked to specific drugs but is extensively associated with various immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases. It has been implicated in multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and other autoimmune conditions. The role of HLA-DRB4 in these diseases typically relates to its function in antigen presentation, potentially leading to aberrant immune responses against self-antigens. Pathways associated with HLA-DRB4 primarily involve immune system processes, particularly those related to antigen processing and presentation.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of HLA-DRB4 mainly concerns its impact on disease susceptibility rather than direct drug responses. However, the expression and specific alleles of HLA-DRB4 can influence the efficacy and safety of treatments in diseases like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. For instance, specific HLA-DRB4 alleles have been studied for their correlation with the responsiveness or adverse reactions to drugs used in these conditions, such as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in RA. Knowledge of HLA-DRB4 alleles can potentially guide more personalized treatment approaches in autoimmune diseases, optimizing therapeutic outcomes and minimizing adverse effects.
