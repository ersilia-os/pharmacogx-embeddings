## Gene Summary
CELSR2 (Cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor 2) is part of the flamingo subfamily, which belongs to the cadherin superfamily. The gene is mainly recognized for its role in the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway and planar cell polarity (PCP), contributing to processes such as neural tube development and orientation of hair cells in the cochlea. It is expressed in various tissues but predominantly in areas involved in neural and cardiovascular development. CELSR2's structure features multiple cadherin repeats, EGF-like domains, and a G-protein coupled receptor proteolytic site (GPS) motif, indicating a complex role in cell communication and signaling.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CELSR2 has been implicated in several pathways and diseases, primarily focusing on its involvement in cholesterol and lipid metabolism. It impacts the regulation of lipid homeostasis, which is crucial for cardiovascular diseases. Variants of CELSR2 have been associated with susceptibility to conditions such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction. This gene is also studied for its involvement in neurological disorders, although less prominently. It operates in various signaling pathways, including those involved in the PCP pathway crucial for cellular orientation and movement, and potentially in the modulation of cholesterol efflux in liver cells.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, the CELSR2 gene has notable associations with lipid-lowering therapies. Polymorphisms in this gene have been linked to different responses to statin therapy, which are widely prescribed drugs for reducing cholesterol levels in patients at risk of cardiovascular diseases. Certain variants in the CELSR2 gene influence the efficacy of statins, potentially affecting the drug dosing and risk management strategies in patients being treated for hypercholesterolemia and related cardiovascular conditions. This pharmacogenetic information can be used to personalize treatments, enhancing the effectiveness and reducing the side effects of statins based on an individualâ€™s genetic profile.
