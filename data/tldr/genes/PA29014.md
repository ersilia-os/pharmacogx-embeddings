## Gene Summary
GSR, or glutathione reductase, is a crucial enzyme involved in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. It catalyzes the reduction of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) to the sulfhydryl form GSH (reduced glutathione), which is a critical molecule in cells for scavenging reactive oxygen species. This function is vital in protecting the cell from oxidative stress. GSR is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues, with high levels typically observed in the liver, adrenal gland, and kidneys, reflecting its key role in detoxification processes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
GSR is implicated in several pathways related to oxidative stress and aging. It figures prominently in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, antioxidant mechanisms, and the glutathione metabolism pathway. Perturbations in GSR function are linked to increased susceptibility to oxidative stress which can lead to various diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Its activity is also associated with resistance to certain chemotherapeutic drugs.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, GSR is of interest primarily due to its role in modulating the efficacy and toxicity of drugs through its influence on oxidative stress and detoxification pathways. Drugs such as cisplatin, carboplatin, and other platinum-based chemotherapeutics are known to be influenced by GSR activity. These drugs induce oxidative stress as part of their cytotoxic mechanisms, and variations in GSR can alter a patient's ability to detoxify reactive intermediates, potentially affecting both therapeutic efficacy and side-effect profiles. As such, GSR could potentially serve as a biomarker for predicting drug response or toxicity, particularly in the context of chemotherapy involving platinum-based compounds.
