## Gene Summary
DHRS2, officially designated as the Dehydrogenase/Reductase 2, is an enzyme-coding gene that primarily functions in retinoid metabolism. The gene is involved in the conversion of retinaldehyde to retinol, playing a crucial role in the active metabolism of Vitamin A and its derivatives. DHRS2 is highly expressed in various human tissues, including the liver, kidneys, and heart. This gene has been implicated in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, particularly due to its role in modulating the levels of bioactive retinoids in tissues.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Although DHRS2 is not directly targeted by any major drugs currently on the market, its involvement in Vitamin A metabolism links it to nutritional therapies and possibly conditions tied to Vitamin A deficiency or excess (e.g., night blindness, keratomalacia). Pathway analysis indicates that DHRS2 participates in the retinoid metabolic process, which is pivotal for vision, epithelial cell maintenance, and immune function. Perturbations in the expression or function of this gene could potentially contribute to diseases associated with abnormal cell proliferation and differentiation, such as cancer and dermatological disorders.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of DHRS2 are not as well developed or clear-cut as those of many other genes more directly linked to pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. There are no specific drug associations documented that are affected by genetic variations within DHRS2. However, its role in Vitamin A metabolism suggests it might influence the efficacy and toxicity of retinoid drugs, such as isotretinoin used in acne treatment, where abnormal metabolism may impact drug behavior or patient response. Further research in the pharmacogenetics of DHRS2 could shed light on how variations in this gene affect the metabolism of retinoids and possibly alter the therapeutic outcomes in treatments involving such agents.
