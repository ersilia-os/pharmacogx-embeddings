## Gene Summary
SLC22A8, also known as the Organic Anion Transporter 3 (OAT3), is a protein-coding gene critical to the transport of various organic compounds, including drugs, toxins, and endogenous metabolites. It is primarily expressed in the kidney and plays a significant role in the excretion of these compounds via the urine, thus modulating their bioavailability and effects in the body. SLC22A8 is part of the solute carrier family, which contains membrane transport proteins that enable the movement of substances across cellular barriers.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SLC22A8 is associated with the transportation of various drugs, including diuretics, antibiotics, and antivirals. It is also implicated in multiple disease states, particularly those involving renal drug excretion and kidney function. Dysfunction or altered expression of this transporter can affect drug clearance and may contribute to nephrotoxicity. The gene is involved in pathways concerning drug metabolism and the handling of xenobiotics, playing a pivotal role in renal secretion pathways. Genetic variations in SLC22A8 can influence the pharmacokinetics of various drugs and thus have implications for efficacy and toxicity.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of SLC22A8 includes significant interactions with drugs such as NSAIDs (e.g., ketoprofen), antivirals (e.g., acyclovir), and diuretics (e.g., furosemide). Variants of this gene can alter transporter function, affecting the renal clearance of these drugs. This can lead to variability in drug bioavailability, efficacy, and risk of adverse effects. Understanding these genetic variations is important for optimizing drug dosing to avoid toxicity while still achieving therapeutic efficacy, particularly in patients with underlying kidney disorders or those on polypharmacy regimens.
