## Gene Summary
CDC5L, or "cell division cycle 5-like," is a gene located on human chromosome 6 and encodes a protein essential for cell cycle regulation. The CDC5L protein is a member of the pre-mRNA splicing factors, implicated in cell division and associated with the regulation of various other cellular processes. Its function includes involvement in mitotic progression, possibly functioning as a link between the cell cycle machinery and the splicing machinery. The protein is more commonly expressed in rapidly dividing cells, suggesting a critical role during active cell division.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CDC5L is involved in several cellular pathways critical for maintaining proper cell cycle control and gene expression regulation. It operates within the spliceosome, a complex responsible for precursor mRNA splicing, playing a pivotal role in pre-mRNA processing and modification. Changes in CDC5L activity and expression are connected to multiple diseases, primarily cancers. Dysregulation of this gene can contribute to the oncogenic process by affecting cell cycle progression and genomic stability. However, concrete links to specific diseases or phenotypes beyond general associations with oncogenesis and cell division abnormalities are still under detailed investigation.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there are limited direct pharmacogenetic associations involving CDC5L concerning specific drugs. However, its central role in cell cycle progression and gene expression regulation makes it an indirect target for drugs aimed at modulating these processes, particularly in cancer therapy. The influence of CDC5L on drug efficacy and safety may be more nuanced and linked with its influence on cellular mechanisms central to the action of anticancer agents. Research into CDC5L's pharmacogenetic profile is ongoing, with the potential to provide new insights into tailored cancer treatment strategies as more data about its interactions with drugs and its impact on therapeutic outcomes are understood.
