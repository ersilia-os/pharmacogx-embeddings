## Gene Summary
DOT1L (DOT1 Like Histone Lysine Methyltransferase) is a non-SET domain-containing methyltransferase, specifically catalyzing the methylation of histone H3 on lysine 79 (H3K79). This methylation status is crucial in various chromatin processes including gene regulation, DNA damage response, and cell cycle regulation. DOT1L's activity affects transcriptional elongation and is linked with the control of several developmental genes. The gene is ubiquitously expressed in various human tissues, playing key roles in both normal cellular function and in disease states.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
DOT1L has been primarily studied for its role in leukemia, particularly in cases involving rearrangements of the MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) gene. These chromosomal translocations result in the fusion of MLL with various partners, often leading to the inappropriate recruitment of DOT1L to MLL target genes and resultant aberrant gene expression. This contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of MLL-rearranged leukemia. Inhibition of DOT1L methyltransferase activity by small molecules has shown potential therapeutic benefits by selectively killing cells with MLL translocations. The gene is also noted in studies relating to developmental defects and cardiac function related to its enzymatic activity on chromatin structure.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of DOT1L is primarily tied to the treatment of malignancies such as MLL-rearranged leukemia. Pinometostat (EPZ-5676) is a small-molecule inhibitor targeting DOT1L, which disrupts the enzymatic activity necessary for the maintenance of the disease phenotype in leukemic cells. This drug has been in clinical trials, emphasizing the potential of targeting DOT1L enzymatic activity in certain cancers. The therapeutic strategy focuses on inhibiting the methylation of H3K79, which is critical for the transcription of genes driving the proliferation of leukemic cells. Improved outcomes with pinometostat have been linked to specific pharmacogenomic profiles where the activity of DOT1L is disrupted, leading to reduced methylation and altered expression of key genes in leukemia pathology. This targeted approach exemplifies the potential of pharmacogenetics in designing cancer therapy based on specific genetic contexts of tumor cells.
