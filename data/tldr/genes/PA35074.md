## Gene Summary
HLA-DRB3 is one of the HLA (human leukocyte antigen) class II beta chain paralogs. Located within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) on chromosome 6, this gene plays a crucial role in the immune system by presenting peptides derived from extracellular proteins to T cells. The HLA complex is critical for effective immune response differentiation between self-molecules and foreign molecules. HLA-DRB3 is expressed in antigen presenting cells and is highly polymorphic, which helps the immune system adapt to recognize a wide array of pathogens.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
HLA-DRB3 is associated with susceptibility to various autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. The gene's involvement is attributed to its role in presenting antigenic peptides to T-cells, influencing whether the immune response will be activated against these peptides. Several pathways involving HLA-DRB3 include antigen processing and presentation, as well as the interplay within adaptive immune response mechanisms which are pivotal in disease pathogenesis and control.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of HLA-DRB3 includes its noted interaction with drug response and susceptibility to drug hypersensitivity reactions. For example, variations in HLA-DRB3 have been associated with different responses to treatments in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, influencing the effectiveness of drugs such as biologic DMARDs (Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs). Although not directly targeted by specific drugs, understanding the HLA-DRB3 alleles an individual carries can be pivotal in predicting risk of adverse drug reactions and in guiding more personalized, effective treatment strategies for autoimmune diseases.
