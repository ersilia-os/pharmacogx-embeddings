## Gene Summary
WDR24, or WD Repeat Domain 24, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular processes including autophagy and protein degradation. The WDR24 gene is a part of a larger complex known as the WDR24-NRTN complex, which has roles in fundamental cellular mechanisms, particularly in nutrient response pathways and metabolic regulation. It is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues but has a more pronounced expression in specific areas like the liver and kidneys, where metabolic processes are highly active.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
WDR24 impacts pathways associated with autophagy and nutrient sensing, which are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and metabolism. Disruptions in these pathways can potentially lead to metabolic derangements. While direct associations with specific diseases are still under investigation, the general functionality of WDR24 suggests its potential involvement in metabolic disorders or conditions related to impaired autophagy such as neurodegenerative diseases. Research suggests that modulating the pathway involving WDR24 could influence cellular resilience and longevity, thus it has a hypothetical implication in age-related phenotypes.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there are no direct pharmacogenetic associations involving WDR24 with specific drugs. However, given its role in cellular metabolism and autophagy, WDR24 may have future implications in the effectiveness or metabolism of drugs that target these pathways. Research into how variations in the WDR24 gene might alter drug response or interact with treatments aimed at modulating autophagy and metabolism is an area of potential pharmacogenetic interest. This could be particularly relevant in the context of drugs used in metabolic disorders or in treating diseases characterized by defective autophagy mechanisms.
