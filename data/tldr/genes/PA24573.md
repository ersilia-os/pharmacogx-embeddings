## Gene Summary
ADH4, also known as Alcohol Dehydrogenase 4, is an enzyme that belongs to the alcohol dehydrogenase family, which plays a key role in the metabolism of alcohols in the liver, converting ethanol to acetaldehyde. ADH4 is mainly expressed in the stomach and liver, and this gene is involved in the pathway of ethanol oxidation. It exhibits a broader substrate specificity compared to other alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes, and is also efficient in metabolizing other substrates, including butanol and retinol.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ADH4 is implicated in several pathways related to alcohol metabolism and the handling of other alcohols which can be substrates or products of metabolic processes, such as retinol metabolism. Variations in the ADH4 gene can influence alcohol dependence and susceptibility to alcohol-related diseases such as alcoholic liver disease, pancreatitis, and possibly cancers of organs like the esophagus and stomach which are in direct contact with consumed alcohols. Moreover, ADH4 through its role in retinoid metabolism can have broader implications in physiological processes and pathological conditions where vitamin A is a factor.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, ADH4 has been studied primarily for its role in alcohol metabolism and the related pharmacogenetic implications it holds in the treatment of alcohol dependence and related disorders. The genetic variants of ADH4 can alter enzyme activity, influencing individual rates of alcohol metabolism and thereby affecting susceptibility to alcoholism and the severity of alcohol-induced damage. No specific direct drug interactions have been extensively characterized for ADH4; however, understanding ADH4 polymorphisms is crucial for personalized approaches in managing conditions like alcoholism, where enzyme activity could predict treatment outcomes with drugs that are used in managing alcohol withdrawal and dependence, like disulfiram or naltrexone. Thus, ADH4 variants are a potential marker for tailoring therapeutic strategies in alcohol-related disorders.
