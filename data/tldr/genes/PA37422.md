## Gene Summary
XRCC3 (X-Ray Repair Cross Complementing 3) is a gene that encodes a member of the RecA/Rad51-related protein family, which plays a crucial role in homologous recombination of DNA during DNA repair. XRCC3 specifically interacts with other Rad51 paralogs to maintain chromosome stability and repair DNA cross-links and double-strand breaks, critical procedures for cellular defense against genetic damage. The gene is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, emphasizing its general importance in genomic maintenance and stability.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
XRCC3 is implicated in the cellular response to DNA damage and contributes to the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents, particularly those that induce DNA breaks or interstrand cross-links. Genotypic variants of XRCC3 are studied for their associations with cancer risk, particularly breast, ovarian, and lung cancers, where DNA repair plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of these diseases. In pathways, XRCC3 is involved in the homologous recombination pathway of DNA repair, crucial for the accurate repair of DNA double-stranded breaks, a common form of DNA damage.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, variants of XRCC3 have been studied for their impact on the response to chemotherapy drugs like cisplatin and carboplatin, which create DNA cross-links that must be repaired by homologous recombination processes. Certain polymorphisms in XRCC3, such as Thr241Met, have been associated with altered risk of therapy-induced toxicities and varying outcomes in cancer treatment efficacy. For instance, the XRCC3 Thr241Met variant has been linked to differences in response to chemotherapeutic agents, influencing both the efficacy and adverse effects profiles in cancer patients, particularly in those with breast and ovarian cancers. Understanding these associations helps in tailoring personalized cancer therapy regimens, enhancing effectiveness while minimizing harmful side effects.
