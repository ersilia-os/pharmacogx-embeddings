## Gene Summary
SMYD3, short for SET and MYND domain-containing protein 3, is a gene implicated in transcriptional regulation and post-translational modification of proteins through its histone methyltransferase activity, primarily targeting histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4). This enzyme is involved in the regulation of gene expression, playing a crucial role in oncogenic processes. SMYD3 is predominantly expressed in tissues such as the heart, brain, and muscles, and it is particularly noted for its high expression in various cancer types.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SMYD3 has been linked extensively with cancer biology, including colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and breast cancer. The overexpression of this gene is often associated with tumor cell growth and metastasis. SMYD3's role extends into vital signaling pathways such as the MAPK and Wnt pathways, contributing to its regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. The modulation of SMYD3 activity offers a potential therapeutic target for the development of anticancer drugs.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, SMYD3 is of interest primarily due to its involvement in cancer progression and response to chemotherapy. Targeted inhibitors of SMYD3 methyltransferase activity, such as EPZ031686 and BAY-6035, are under investigation for their potential to suppress tumor growth in cancers where SMYD3 is found to be overexpressed. Research into SMYD3â€™s pharmacogenetic profile suggests that polymorphisms within the SMYD3 gene might predict individual responses to these emerging therapies, although detailed clinical data is still forthcoming. Thus, understanding variations in SMYD3 could be key to optimizing therapeutic strategies against cancer.
