## Gene Summary
CCHCR1, or Coiled-Coil Î±-Helical Rod protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein thought to be involved in the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation. The gene is located on chromosome 6p21.3, which is a region rich in genetic elements associated with psoriatic susceptibility. The function of CCHCR1 is not completely understood, but it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis through modulation of steroidogenesis and involvement in processes related to cell cycle and immune responses.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CCHCR1 has been most widely studied in the context of psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease. Variants in this gene, particularly the HLA-Cw*0602 allele, have been associated with the development and severity of psoriasis. CCHCR1 interacts with various pathways implicated in skin health, including those involving cytokine signaling and epidermal growth and repair. Research also suggests connections to other autoimmune and skin-related disorders, possibly extending to mechanisms shared with other inflammatory conditions.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic implications of CCHCR1 are mainly derived from its association with psoriasis. Given the gene's potential role in the disease's pathogenesis, it stands as a possible target for therapeutic intervention, although direct connections between CCHCR1 and specific psoriasis drugs have not been firmly established in the literature. Understanding the function and variations of CCHCR1 can contribute to the development of personalized medicine approaches, particularly for treatments aimed at modulating immune system functions or epidermal differentiation in patients with psoriasis. However, more research is needed to detail specific drug-gene interactions and to develop targeted therapies based on CCHCR1 genetic profiles.
