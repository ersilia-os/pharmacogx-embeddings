## Gene Summary
VASP, or Vasodilator-Stimulated Phosphoprotein, plays crucial roles in actin filament elongation, cell adhesion, and motility. It is widely expressed across various tissues but is particularly prominent in platelets and endothelial cells. VASP is involved in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and works in tandem with proteins such as profilin. Its function is modulated through phosphorylation by cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases, which is crucial for the regulation of cellular responses to external stimuli, especially in the vascular system.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
VASP is implicated in pathways that regulate blood vessel function, including vasodilation and thrombosis. It is particularly significant in conditions related to cardiovascular health due to its involvement with platelet function and endothelial response. For instance, alterations in VASP function or expression can influence the pathology of diseases such as atherosclerosis, ischemic stroke, and other thrombotic conditions. VASP's role in phenotype expressions of diseases comes from changes in cytokinesis, cell spreading, and dynamic cellular extensions, which are critical during vascular injury and repair.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, VASP primarily features in the context of cardiovascular drug responses. Although direct associations with specific drugs are limited, the phosphorylation state of VASP is used as a biomarker to assess the efficacy of antiplatelet therapy, particularly P2Y12 inhibitors like clopidogrel and ticagrelor. Changes in the phosphorylation of VASP can reflect different sensitivities or resistance to these drugs, influencing decisions in cardiovascular treatment strategies. Thus, VASP is not directly targeted by these therapies, but its activity provides valuable insights into patient-specific responses to treatment, which can guide personalized medicine approaches in cardiovascular care.
