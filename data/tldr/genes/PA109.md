## Gene Summary
The CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) gene encodes a protein that functions as a chloride channel and is involved in the regulation of salt and water transport across epithelial membranes. The gene is primarily expressed in the epithelial cells of the lungs, pancreas, and other organs. Mutations in CFTR are best known for causing cystic fibrosis (CF), a severe autosomal recessive disorder that leads to thick mucus secretion blocking airways and causing severe respiratory and digestive problems.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CFTR mutations are directly linked to cystic fibrosis, which affects various systems but predominantly the respiratory and digestive systems. The dysfunction of CFTR protein results in abnormal transport of chloride and sodium across an epithelium, leading to thick, viscous secretions. The gene is also associated with disorders such as congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), leading to male infertility. Several CFTR modulators have been developed as targeted therapies for cystic fibrosis, addressing specific mutations in the CFTR gene. Pathways involving CFTR include epithelial cell signaling in Helicobacter pylori infection and purine metabolism.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of CFTR is primarily concerned with the treatment of cystic fibrosis through drug response based on the specific mutations present in the CFTR gene. Several drugs, such as Ivacaftor, Lumacaftor, and Tezacaftor are used as CFTR modulators to improve the function of defective CFTR protein caused by specific mutations. Ivacaftor targets gating mutations (such as G551D), enhancing the chloride transport activity of CFTR. Lumacaftor and Tezacaftor, often used in combination with Ivacaftor, help in correcting the folding defect of the CFTR protein affected by the most common mutation, F508del. The efficacy of these drugs depends significantly on the type of mutation in the CFTR gene, highlighting the importance of genetic testing in personalizing treatment approaches for cystic fibrosis patients.
