## Gene Summary
ACE2, or angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, is a critical enzyme involved in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which regulates blood pressure, fluid and electrolyte balance, and systemic vascular resistance. This gene encodes for a protein that functions primarily as a carboxypeptidase, converting angiotensin I to the nonapeptide angiotensin 1-9, and angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7, which acts as a vasodilator. ACE2 is widely expressed in the heart, kidneys, and lungs, and has a pivotal role in cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology. Additionally, ACE2 serves as the entry point for coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ACE2 is centrally involved in pathophysiological conditions such as hypertension, heart failure, and renal disease, highlighting its significance in cardiovascular and renal disorders. The enzyme is part of the alternative pathway of RAS, and manipulations in its activity can significantly affect disease progression and outcomes in the associated conditions. Additionally, its role as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 links ACE2 to respiratory conditions, particularly COVID-19. The expression and regulation of ACE2 are influenced by several contributors including genetic variants, which impact susceptibility to various diseases and outcomes.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of ACE2 are especially relevant due to the enzyme's position as a target for therapies aimed at cardiovascular and renal diseases. Various drugs used in the management of these diseases, such as ACE inhibitors (e.g., lisinopril) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs, e.g., losartan), indirectly influence ACE2 activity and expression. While ACE inhibitors and ARBs do not directly target ACE2, their alterations of the renin-angiotensin pathway affect the systemic levels of angiotensin II, potentially modulating ACE2 expression and activity. Moreover, as ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, understanding the genetic variations in ACE2 can also help in comprehending differences in COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, and responses to treatment among individuals, thus influencing decision-making on therapeutic strategies for managing COVID-19, including considerations around the use of RAS inhibitors.
