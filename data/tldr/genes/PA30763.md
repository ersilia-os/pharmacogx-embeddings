## Gene Summary
MET, also known as the MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase, codes for the protein known as hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR). MET is primarily involved in embryonic development and wound healing. The protein functions through engagement with its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), triggering a wide array of downstream signaling pathways, including those influencing cell growth, motility, and differentiation. MET is most prominently expressed in epithelial cells across organs such as the liver, pancreas, prostate, lung, kidney, and bone marrow.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
MET is implicated in various pathological conditions, primarily cancers such as renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and hepatocellular carcinoma. The aberrant activation of MET, either due to mutation or overexpression, is known to drive tumorigenesis, promote metastasis, and confer resistance to therapies. MET acts through key pathways such as PI3K/AKT, RAS/MAPK, and STAT, which are critical in cell survival and proliferation. Due to its role in cancer, MET is a target for several anticancer drugs, which aim to inhibit its tyrosine kinase activity.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, MET gene variants significantly influence the response to MET inhibitors used in cancer treatment. Drugs such as crizotinib, capmatinib, and tivantinib target the MET signaling pathway. Crizotinib, for instance, is more effective against NSCLC characterized by MET exon 14 skipping mutations. Similarly, variants in MET can alter the efficacy and toxicity profile of these drugs, making genetic testing a valuable tool for personalized medicine in oncology. This genetic profiling helps in predicting patient response to MET inhibitors and tailoring treatments that are more effective and have fewer side effects.
