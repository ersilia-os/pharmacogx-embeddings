## Gene Summary
HRAS (Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) is one of the human genes encoding a protein belonging to the Ras family of GTPases. These proteins play a crucial role in cellular signal transduction, acting as binary molecular switches that control intracellular signaling networks. HRAS is involved in numerous cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The protein encoded by HRAS can bind GTP and GDP, and alternates between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state, influenced by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs).

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
HRAS mutations are impactful in the context of cancer, particularly associated with Costello syndrome, a disorder characterized by increased risk of developing neoplasms, developmental delays, and distinctive facial features. Aberrant HRAS signaling contributes to oncogenesis in a variety of cancers, including bladder cancer, follicular thyroid cancer, and kidney cancer. The pathway involvement predominantly centers around the MAPK signaling cascade, integral for cell division, differentiation, and apoptosis. Due to its role in these fundamental pathways, HRAS is a significant target in cancer research aimed at finding therapeutic inhibitors that can modulate its activity.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, HRAS is especially relevant in cancer treatment strategies. Although direct targeting of HRAS with drugs is challenging, downstream effectors and pathways offer viable targets for pharmacological intervention. Drugs such as Trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, indirectly affects HRAS-driven signaling pathways by inhibiting MEK, part of the MAPK pathway. Tipifarnib targets the pathway by inhibiting a protein responsible for the post-translational modification of HRAS, thus demonstrating the potential to mitigate HRAS-mediated oncogenic signaling. Understanding the genetic status of HRAS could influence the therapeutic approaches in cancers where HRAS mutations are prevalent, guiding the use of targeted therapies that can better manage or halt progression of disease driven by aberrant HRAS activity.
