## Gene Summary
SLC22A13, also known as Solute Carrier Family 22 Member 13, is a protein-coding gene that belongs to the organic cation transporter family. This gene plays a crucial role in the transport of various organic cations across the cell membrane. SLC22A13 is predominantly expressed in kidneys and liver, where it is involved in the filtration and excretion of endogenous and exogenous organic cations from the body. The functional expression of SLC22A13 facilitates the clearance of harmful substances and drugs, contributing to the detoxification processes essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Recent studies and databases linking SLC22A13 to specific drugs, diseases, or phenotypes are still limited. However, given the role of the gene in organic cation transport, alterations in its expression or function could potentially influence the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized through these transporters. This gene might also be implicated in certain renal disorders due to its significant role in kidney function. In terms of pathways, SLC22A13 is involved in the transport and clearance pathways that are essential for the elimination of toxins and drugs, playing a role in maintaining metabolic balance.

## Pharmacogenetics
While comprehensive pharmacogenetic information specific to SLC22A13 is not extensively detailed, the gene's function suggests it could influence the pharmacokinetics of certain drugs, particularly those that are cationic. Variants in SLC22A13 could potentially alter the transport efficiency of these drugs, leading to variations in drug levels in the body, which could affect drug efficacy and toxicity. Detailed studies are needed to establish firm pharmacogenetic associations, which could guide personalized therapy approaches based on SLC22A13 genetic variations. As pharmacogenetic insights evolve, SLC22A13 may become a noteworthy gene of interest in the context of personalizing dosages for improved therapeutic outcomes and minimized adverse effects.
