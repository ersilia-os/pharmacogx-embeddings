## Gene Summary
ABCC4, also known as Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 4 (MRP4), is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. These transporters play a vital role in the movement of substrates across cellular membranes, using ATP hydrolysis for energy. ABCC4 primarily functions in the efflux of a variety of physiological substrates out of cells, including cyclic nucleotides, uric acid, and several other organic anions. It is expressed in a range of tissues, prominently in the kidneys, liver, and placenta, but also found in the brain, heart, and lungs, where it influences toxin secretion, drug excretion, and tissue protection.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ABCC4 is implicated in numerous physiological roles and pathological conditions, primarily due to its function in drug transport and resistance. Its overexpression in cancer cells can contribute to chemotherapy resistance by actively effluxing anticancer drugs out of cells. This gene has also been studied for its role in pulmonary conditions, and its altered expression or function has potential involvement in disorders related to abnormal transporter activities such as gout and cardiovascular diseases. Pathway involvement typically includes those associated with xenobiotic metabolism and pharmacokinetics, affecting drug absorption and disposition.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic research on ABCC4 has primarily focused on its role in cancer pharmacology and the efficacy and toxicity of antineoplastic agents. Variants in ABCC4 have been associated with altered responses to several drugs, including thiopurines (mercaptopurine), nucleoside-based antiretroviral drugs used in HIV treatment (such as azidothymidine), and anti-platelet therapy drugs (like clopidogrel). Such variants can influence drug efflux from cells, thereby modifying drug efficacy and side effects. In cancer therapy, ABCC4's influence on drug resistance substantially affects treatment outcomes, emphasizing the need for genotyping and personalized treatment approaches in oncology.
