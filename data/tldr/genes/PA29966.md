## Gene Summary
ITIH3 (Inter-Alpha-Trypsin Inhibitor Heavy Chain 3) is part of the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (ITI) family, known for its role in extracellular matrix stability and inflammation modulation. ITIH3 forms a complex with other ITIH members and hyaluronic acid, contributing to the stabilization of the extracellular matrix and potentially influencing cellular behaviors such as adhesion and migration. ITIH3 is expressed in various tissues, including liver, lung, and kidney, suggesting a widespread role in human physiology.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The ITIH3 gene is implicated in a range of biological pathways mainly associated with the metabolism of proteins involved in the acute inflammatory response and other aspects of immune system function. This gene's protein product connects to pathways that stabilize the extracellular matrix via interactions with hyaluronic acid. Diseases linked to ITIH3 include inflammatory states and possibly cancer, although direct associations are not thoroughly defined. Dysregulation of ITIH3 has been observed in conditions such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease and certain cardiovascular diseases suggesting potential as a biomarker.

## Pharmacogenetics
Current pharmacogenetic data on ITIH3 is limited, and direct associations with specific drug responses or interactions are not well established. Research into the pharmacogenetics of ITIH3 is still in its early stages, with ongoing studies aimed at understanding how genetic variants of ITIH3 might influence disease progression or treatment outcomes in disorders such as cancer or chronic inflammatory conditions. The exploration into ITIH3 could lead to a better understanding of its role in disease mechanisms which may later translate into tailored therapeutic approaches or as a target for drug development.
