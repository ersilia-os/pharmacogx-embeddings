## Gene Summary
GADL1, officially known as Glutamate Decarboxylase Like 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the biosynthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) through the decarboxylation of L-glutamate. Though it shares sequence similarity with glutamate decarboxylases, its enzymatic activity differs as it primarily acts on L-aspartate rather than L-glutamate, and does not effectively synthesize GABA. GADL1 is differentially expressed in various tissues including the kidney, liver, and pancreas, suggesting a role in the metabolism of amino acids in these organs.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
GADL1 has not been prominently linked to specific drugs or complex disease phenotypes in the current biomedical literature, indicating that its clinical implications, if any, remain to be fully elucidated. The pathways involving GADL1 primarily relate to amino acid metabolism. Given its function, alterations in its expression or mutation could theoretically impact metabolic processes, though direct links to distinct phenotypes or pathologies have not been extensively documented.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of GADL1 has not been well characterized compared to more clinically prominent genes, and there are no specific, widely recognized associations with pharmacological agents thus far. Despite this, understanding the variations in the GADL1 gene could potentially lead to insights concerning individual differences in metabolism of amino acids, which might influence responses to drugs that interact with or affect amino acid neurotransmitter systems. However, as of now, such associations are speculative and require substantial further research.
