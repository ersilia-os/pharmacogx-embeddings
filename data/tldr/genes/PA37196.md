## Gene Summary
UHRF1, or Ubiquitin-like with PHD and RING Finger domains 1, is a gene that plays a crucial role in DNA methylation and the maintenance of epigenetic marks during DNA replication. The protein encoded by this gene functions in the S phase of the cell cycle and is linked to the maintenance of DNA methylation patterns, a key aspect of genomic stability and regulation of gene expression. UHRF1 serves as a reader of methylated DNA by binding hemi-methylated DNA, and it also recruits DNA methyltransferases, thereby contributing to the maintenance of DNA methylation inheritance. It is ubiquitously expressed but predominantly active in proliferating cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
UHRF1 has been implicated in several cellular pathways and regulatory mechanisms, most notably those involving chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, and cell cycle regulation. Dysfunction or deregulation of UHRF1 is associated with various cancer types, including breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers. Due to its role in DNA methylation and tumor suppression, it is also a potential biomarker for cancer diagnosis and a target for therapeutic interventions. In cancer cells, overexpression of UHRF1 has been frequently observed, which correlates with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of UHRF1 are primarily explored in the context of cancer therapy. Given its crucial role in maintaining DNA methylation and tumor progression, UHRF1 is a novel target for epigenetic therapies. Research is focused on how modulating UHRF1 expression or function can affect the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs, particularly in cancers where it is overexpressed. Specific inhibitors targeting UHRF1 or its interactions may enhance the response to existing cancer treatments or could be used in the development of new therapeutic strategies. While direct associations with specific drugs through pharmacogenetic studies are yet to be robustly established, the potential impact of UHRF1 on drug response in oncology is a promising area for future research.
