## Gene Summary
HLA-E, or Human Leukocyte Antigen E, is a gene encoding an MHC class I molecule, which plays a crucial role in the immune system by presenting antigens to T cells. It is located within the MHC class I region on chromosome 6. HLA-E is notable for its relatively limited polymorphism compared to other class I HLAs and presents a restricted set of peptides derived primarily from the signal sequences of other HLA class I molecules. This gene is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues but is more prominent in immune cells. HLA-E is involved in immune recognition by interacting with NK cell receptors, thus influencing the immune systemâ€™s response to infected or malignant cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
HLA-E is involved in various immune-mediated diseases and conditions due to its role in antigen presentation and immune regulation. It is associated with disease susceptibilities such as viral infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. The interaction of HLA-E with receptors such as NKG2A/C expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and some T cells modulates immune responses, potentially affecting disease outcome and severity. It is also implicated in transplantation biology, where its expression can impact graft acceptance and rejection. Furthermore, HLA-E participates in immune regulation pathways, including the presentation of viral and self-peptides to immune cells, playing a role in immune evasion and tolerance.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, the HLA-E gene has crucial implications, particularly in the field of transplantation and immune-modulating therapies. Although direct associations with specific drugs are not extensively characterized like other HLA genes (e.g., HLA-B or HLA-A), variations in HLA-E could potentially influence the efficacy and safety of drugs that modulate immune responses, including certain biologics used in autoimmune diseases and cancers. For example, understanding the role of HLA-E in immune checkpoint pathways could guide the use of checkpoint inhibitors in cancer therapy. Moreover, the influence of HLA-E on NK cell activity suggests that it could impact the outcomes of treatments involving NK cell modulation. As with other HLA genes, HLA-E could also be relevant in hypersensitivity reactions to certain drugs, although specific drug associations are less documented compared to other members of the HLA gene family.
