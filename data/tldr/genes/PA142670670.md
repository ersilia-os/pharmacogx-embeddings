## Gene Summary
TUBB2A (Tubulin Beta 2A Class IIa) is a member of the tubulin family, which primarily constitute the microtubule building blocks of the cytoskeleton. The beta tubulins are an integral part of cell structure and function and are essential in the formation of microtubules. These microtubules play critical roles in maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and facilitating cell division. TUBB2A is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues, with significant expression in neuronal tissues, reflecting its role in nervous system development and functioning.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
TUBB2A is implicated in various cellular pathways, including those governing cell structure and motility, such as the regulation of microtubule stability. Mutations in this gene have been associated with developmental disorders and neurological conditions. Specifically, TUBB2A variants have been linked to cortical dysplasia and other cortical abnormalities which may result in epilepsy or developmental delays. These conditions emphasize the gene's role in neuronal development and proper brain function.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of TUBB2A is not extensively documented, mainly focusing on its involvement in disease rather than direct interactions with drugs. However, given its fundamental role in microtubule formation, it is conceivably relevant to the pharmacodynamics of microtubule-targeting agents used in cancer therapy, such as the taxanes and vinca alkaloids. These drugs target microtubule dynamics, an essential process in rapidly dividing tumor cells, potentially making TUBB2A a candidate for future pharmacogenetic research to understand different responses to such therapies based on genetic variations.
