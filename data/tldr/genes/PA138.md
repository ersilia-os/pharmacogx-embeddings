## Gene Summary
DCTD is the official symbol for the gene encoding deoxycytidylate deaminase, an enzyme involved in the pyrimidine salvage pathway, which is essential for nucleotide metabolism. DCTD catalyzes the deamination of dCMP (deoxycytidine monophosphate) to dUMP (deoxyuridine monophosphate), which is a precursor for thymidylate synthesis. Expression of DCTD is critical in rapidly dividing cells where DNA synthesis is significant, including various tissues and cancer cells, thus underscoring its importance in cellular proliferation and growth.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
DCTD plays a role in several key pathways, including thymidylate biosynthesis and pyrimidine metabolism, which are crucial for DNA replication and repair. Disturbances in these pathways can lead to genomic instability and contribute to oncogenesis. DCTD has been studied in the context of cancer, particularly due to its role in nucleotide metabolism, which is often altered in malignant cells. The enzyme's function makes it a potential target for chemotherapeutic agents that aim to disrupt DNA synthesis in cancer cells.

## Pharmacogenetics
DCTD's pharmacogenetic profile is significant in the context of cancer treatment, where drugs targeting nucleotide metabolism can be influenced by variations in the DCTD gene. For instance, the antimetabolite drug cytarabine, used in the treatment of various leukemias, is converted within the body into its active triphosphate form, which can be influenced by the activity of DCTD. Genetic variations in DCTD could affect drug efficacy and toxicity, impacting patient response to therapy. Personalized medicine approaches often consider such genetic factors to optimize dosing and select the best therapeutic strategies for individual patients based on their DCTD gene profile.
