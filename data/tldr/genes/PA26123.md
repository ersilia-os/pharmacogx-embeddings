## Gene Summary
CBS (Cystathionine Beta-Synthase) is a crucial enzyme in the metabolism of methionine, an essential amino acid. It catalyzes the first step of the transsulfuration pathway, converting homocysteine to cystathionine, which is subsequently converted to cysteine. This process is vital for maintaining low homocysteine levels and producing cysteine, an antioxidant precursor. CBS is predominantly expressed in the liver but also found in the kidney and pancreas. Mutations in this gene lead to CBS deficiency, which can cause a wide range of health issues, including increased risk for cardiovascular and neurological diseases due to elevated homocysteine levels in the blood.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The dysfunction of CBS is primarily associated with homocystinuria, a rare genetic disorder characterized by high levels of homocysteine in urine, blood, and tissues. Symptoms include visual impairment, skeletal abnormalities, and developmental delay. CBS deficiency may also contribute to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases like thrombosis, as homocysteine is a recognized risk factor for vascular damage. In metabolic pathways, CBS is a key component in the transsulfuration pathway that affects the regulation of sulfur amino acids crucial for various metabolic functions. Studies have also linked aberrations in this pathway to diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s due to the role of sulfur-containing antioxidants in protecting neuronal health.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic research on CBS has mainly focused on understanding how variations in this gene affect drug metabolism and disease risk rather than direct drug-gene interactions. Individuals with certain CBS mutations may have altered responses to treatments that influence homocysteine levels, such as vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), which is used as a cofactor by the CBS enzyme to facilitate its activity. For patients with homocystinuria, high doses of vitamin B6 are often prescribed to reduce homocysteine levels and mitigate the risk of associated complications. There is also ongoing investigation into how this gene's polymorphisms might influence the efficacy and safety of drugs used to treat cardiovascular and neurodegenerative conditions, potentially guiding personalized medical approaches based on a patient's CBS genetic profile.
