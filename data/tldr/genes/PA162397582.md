## Gene Summary
NKAIN3, or Sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit beta-1-interacting protein 3, is a gene involved in the modulation of sodium and potassium ATPase activities. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the proper function of ion gradients across the plasma membrane, contributing to various cellular processes including neuronal activity. NKAIN3 is prevalently expressed in the brain where it plays roles in neurological development and function. Its function suggests an involvement in intricate neuronal signaling pathways, and disruptions in NKAIN3 may impact neural functionality.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NKAIN3 has notable implications in neurological disorders, though its exact disease associations and phenotypic manifestations are still under exploration in clinical genetics. Studies have suggested links between mutations or dysregulation of NKAIN3 and certain developmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, including potentially schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The pathways involving NKAIN3 chiefly include those related to ion transport and neural signal transmission. Understanding these pathways can shed light on the physiological and possibly pathophysiological roles of NKAIN3 in neural functioning and disorders.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is currently limited information specifically relating NKAIN3 to pharmacogenetics and direct interactions with drugs. However, due to its role in neural ion transport, it is indirectly related to the effectiveness or action of neurological drugs, such as those used in treating bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. These drugs often target ion channel activity directly or the broader neural signaling pathways, and variations in NKAIN3 could hypothetically influence drug response or resistance. Future pharmacogenetic studies may reveal more about NKAIN3 variations and their implications for drug efficacy and safety in neurological treatment.
