## Gene Summary
METTL1 (Methyltransferase Like 1) is a gene encoding a protein that functions primarily as an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase. This enzyme is involved in the modification of tRNA by catalyzing the methylation of N7 on guanine at position 46 (m7G46) in tRNA. This methylation is critical for maintaining the proper structure and function of tRNA, and thus, plays a key role in the fidelity and efficiency of protein synthesis. METTL1 is expressed in various tissues, with significant implications in cellular processes related to translation and possibly in the response to cellular stress.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The function of METTL1 has been implicated in the development of certain cancers and disorders of translation due to its role in tRNA modification and protein synthesis. Abnormal levels of METTL1 expression have been observed in various tumor types, suggesting its potential role in tumorigenesis. On a molecular level, METTL1 is part of a pathway that includes interactions with other gene products involved in RNA processing and modification, influencing both normal physiological functions and pathological conditions. It also interacts with components of the methionine and folate metabolism pathways indirectly through its requirement for SAM.

## Pharmacogenetics
Current pharmacogenetic research related to METTL1 is limited but growing, as researchers are beginning to explore the potential of targeting METTL1 for therapeutic benefits, especially in cancer. Given its role in essential cellular processes such as tRNA methylation and protein synthesis, METTL1 represents a potential target for drugs aiming to modulate translation efficiency or restore tRNA function in disease states. However, specific drugs directly targeting METTL1 have not yet been established, and most research is at the experimental or preclinical stage. Further studies and clinical trials are necessary to better understand the pharmacogenetic implications of METTL1 modulation in therapy.
