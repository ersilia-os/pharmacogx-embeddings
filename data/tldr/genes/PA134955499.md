## Gene Summary
METTL3 (Methyltransferase Like 3) is a gene that encodes for an enzyme primarily involved in the methylation of the N6 position of adenosine in mRNA, which is a vital post-transcriptional modification known as N6-methyladenosine (m6A). This modification influences various aspects of mRNA metabolism, including stability, splicing, and translation. METTL3 functions as a part of a methyltransferase complex, often working in conjunction with METTL14 and other co-factors. It is widely expressed in numerous tissues, playing crucial roles in normal physiological processes as well as in the pathogenesis of diseases.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
METTL3 has been implicated in several pathways and disease contexts. It plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression and cellular differentiation, and dysregulation can be involved in the development of cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and glioblastoma. Research has shown that METTL3 influences processes like stem cell renewal and apoptosis, which are critical in both normal cellular function and malignancy. Phenotypically, alterations in METTL3 expression or function may influence tumor progression, metastasis, and resistance to therapy.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the field of pharmacogenetics, METTL3â€™s role has been increasingly studied in relation to cancer therapy. Its expression levels and mutation status have been explored for potential predictive and prognostic significance. For instance, METTL3 inhibitors are being investigated for their therapeutic potentials against cancers where METTL3 is found to be overexpressed or mutated. Though specific drugs targeting METTL3 directly are still under preclinical and early clinical development, the understanding of its pharmacogenetic impact continues to evolve, indicating a promising avenue for targeted cancer therapies.
