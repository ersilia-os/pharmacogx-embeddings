## Gene Summary
NQO1, officially known as NAD(P)H Quinone Dehydrogenase 1, is a cytosolic enzyme involved in the reduction of quinones to hydroquinones. This reaction is critical as it prevents the formation of semiquinone radicals and reactive oxygen species, thus protecting cells from oxidative stress and potential mutagenic activity. NQO1 is broadly expressed across various tissues, with particularly high levels in the liver, lung, and adrenal gland. Its activity is notably induced by oxidative stress and exposure to antioxidants, regulated at the transcriptional level by the antioxidant response element (ARE).

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NQO1 is implicated in several key pathways related to both cancer chemoprotection and therapy. Its involvement in detoxifying quinones and their derivatives makes it important in the metabolism of environmental toxins and chemotherapeutic drugs. Due to its role in redox cycling and protection, NQO1 deficiency or dysfunction is associated with increased susceptibility to various forms of cancer, and its overexpression is observed in many tumors. Diseases linked with alterations in NQO1 expression or function include various types of cancers, notably breast and lung cancers, as well as neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, where oxidative stress plays a pathogenic role.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, NQO1 plays a pivotal role in the response to several anticancer agents. Its ability to bioactivate or detoxify drugs can significantly influence the efficacy and toxicity profiles of specific treatments. Drugs such as mitomycin C, dicoumarol, and cyclopamine are affected by NQO1 activity. Genetic polymorphisms in NQO1, particularly the C609T variant that leads to a substantial reduction in enzyme activity, are critical in determining the individual's response to treatment. This polymorphism has been associated with altered effectiveness and adverse effects of various chemotherapy agents, suggesting that genotyping NQO1 could be important in personalizing treatment regimens for cancer therapy.
