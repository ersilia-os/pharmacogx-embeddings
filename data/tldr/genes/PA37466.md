## Gene Summary
ZMPSTE24, also known as Zinc Metallopeptidase STE24, is a gene involved in post-translational processing of prelamin A, a precursor protein of lamin A. Lamin A is a critical component of the nuclear lamina, which provides structural support to the nucleus in eukaryotic cells. ZMPSTE24 is an integral membrane protein that functions as an endoprotease, cleaving the carboxyl-terminal region of prelamin A to release mature lamin A. This process is essential for the correct assembly of the nuclear envelope and for maintaining the integrity of the nucleus. ZMPSTE24 is ubiquitously expressed, although its highest expression levels are observed in tissues with high proliferative activity.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in ZMPSTE24 are associated with rare genetic disorders, including restrictive dermopathy and certain cases of progeroid syndromes, such as Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) and Mandibuloacral Dysplasia. These conditions are characterized by premature aging, growth retardation, and a variety of skeletal abnormalities. In the context of pathways, ZMPSTE24 is a crucial part of the laminopathy pathway and nuclear envelope dynamics. These diseases arise primarily due to the accumulation of farnesylated and carboxymethylated prelamin A, which is toxic to cells due to its inability to integrate properly into the nuclear lamina.

## Pharmacogenetics
Given the role of ZMPSTE24 in the processing of prelamin A and its implications in progeroid syndromes, pharmacogenetic research has focused on interventions that can alleviate or modify the disease phenotypes associated with its dysfunction. Although there are no mainstream drugs targeting ZMPSTE24 directly, the understanding of its genetic variations can potentially guide the use of drugs that modify prelamin A processing or ameliorate symptoms of associated diseases. Research into potential therapeutic strategies includes the use of farnesyltransferase inhibitors which can prevent the farnesylation of prelamin A, thereby decreasing the toxic buildup of misprocessed prelamin A. This pharmacogenetic approach is still largely experimental but holds promise for treating or managing progeroid laminopathies.
