## Gene Summary
RASSF1, standing for Ras Association Domain Family Member 1, is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. The gene is primarily expressed in lung, breast, and kidney tissues but shows ubiquitous distribution with varying expression levels across different tissues. RASSF1 is known for its involvement in microtubule stabilization and its interaction with several molecules involved in apoptosis signaling pathways, such as the mammalian sterile 20-like kinases (MST1 and MST2).

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
RASSF1 has been extensively studied in relation to various forms of cancer, most notably in lung, breast, and kidney cancers. Loss of its expression, often due to promoter hypermethylation, has been associated with the development and progression of these tumors. Phenotypically, alterations in RASSF1 can lead to disruptions in normal cell cycle processes and a reduction in apoptotic capabilities, facilitating tumor growth and survival. In cellular pathways, RASSF1 interacts with the Ras signaling pathway, modulating important cellular functions, including cell proliferation and death. 

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, the study of RASSF1 primarily focuses on its role as a marker for cancer prognosis and response to therapy rather than direct associations with specific drugs. The gene's methylation status has been proposed as a potential biomarker for predicting the efficacy of certain chemotherapeutic agents, particularly in lung and breast cancers. Research suggests that patients with hypermethylated RASSF1 may have differing responses to drugs that target epigenetic modifications or the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Although direct drug-gene interactions are not extensively documented, understanding the epigenetic regulation of RASSF1 could influence treatment strategies, potentially leading towards more personalized therapy regimens in cancers where RASSF1 is implicated.
