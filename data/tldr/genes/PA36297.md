## Gene Summary
TAC1 (Tachykinin Precursor 1) encodes the precursors for several tachykinins, which are a family of neuropeptides. These peptides, including substance P, neurokinin A, neuropeptide K, and neuropeptide gamma, are known to participate in a variety of neuronal and immunological functions. TAC1 is expressed primarily in the central nervous system but also found in the gastrointestinal tract and other peripheral tissues. The peptides derived from TAC1 are involved in neurotransmission, with roles in pain perception, inflammation, and vasodilation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The peptides produced by TAC1 activation are implicated in numerous physiological and pathological processes. These include roles in mood disorders, anxiety, stress, respiratory rhythm, inflammatory diseases, and cancer. Substance P and neurokinin A, in particular, are involved in the signaling pathways that mediate pain and inflammatory responses. Substance P is also notable for its role in neurogenic inflammation and its implications in conditions such as asthma, migraine, and fibromyalgia. The gene is therefore considered critical in the study of both neurological conditions and immune responses.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, TAC1 has emerging significance due to its implications in pain management and inflammatory diseases. Drugs targeting the NK1 receptor, for which substance P is a natural ligand, include aprepitant and fosaprepitant, which are used primarily for their antiemetic properties in chemotherapy. The response to these drugs can vary based on genetic differences in the TAC1 gene expression or function, potentially influencing their efficacy or risk of side effects. Understanding variations in TAC1 can contribute to personalized medicine approaches, particularly in managing pain, inflammation, and emesis in cancer patients.
