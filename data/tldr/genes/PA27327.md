## Gene Summary
DHODH (Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase) is an essential mitochondrial enzyme implicated in the de novo synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. This gene encodes an inner mitochondrial membrane protein that functions to catalyze the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate, which is a critical step in the production of uridine monophosphate (UMP). DHODH is pivotal for DNA and RNA synthesis and thus plays an essential role in cellular proliferation and metabolism. It is expressed in various tissues, with notable activity in rapidly dividing cells such as those in the immune system and tumors.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
DHODH has been studied extensively in both cancer and autoimmune disorders due to its key role in nucleotide synthesis. It is part of the pyrimidine synthesis pathway, which is critical for cellular growth and division. Inhibitors of DHODH, such as leflunomide and teriflunomide, are utilized in treating diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis due to their ability to attenuate the proliferation of activated lymphocytes by limiting pyrimidine synthesis. Furthermore, altered expression and activity of DHODH have been linked to various cancer types, suggesting a potential target for chemotherapeutic intervention.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic aspects of DHODH are principally focused on its inhibition effects used in therapies for autoimmune diseases and cancers. Leflunomide and its active metabolite teriflunomide are the primary drugs that target DHODH. They are notably used in managing rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, respectively. The pharmacogenetic response to these drugs can vary substantially among individuals, which may be influenced by variations in the DHODH gene itself or in genes related to the immune response and pyrimidine metabolism. Understanding individual genetic predispositions can potentially optimize dosing regimes and minimize adverse effects, improving therapeutic outcomes. Insights into genotypic effects on drug efficacy and safety remain an ongoing field of research with significant clinical implications.
