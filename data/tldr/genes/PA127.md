## Gene Summary
CYP2C18 is a gene encoding the enzyme Cytochrome P450 2C18, which is part of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. These enzymes are critical for the metabolism of various substrates, including drugs, fatty acids, and steroids. CYP2C18 is expressed in the liver, although it has relatively low overall expression compared to other members of the CYP2C subfamily such as CYP2C9 or CYP2C19. The enzyme encoded by CYP2C18 is involved in the metabolism of endogenous substances and plays a role in the oxidative metabolism of a small number of xenobiotic compounds.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CYP2C18, like many cytochrome P450 enzymes, is implicated in the biochemical pathway for the metabolism of certain drugs. However, due to its low expression and activity, its influence on pharmacokinetics is generally less pronounced than that of its more active relatives. It has been less extensively characterized in terms of specific substrate interactions compared to other CYP2C family members. The enzyme's role in disease is not well-defined, mainly due to its limited expression and activity, but variations in CYP2C18 could potentially influence the metabolism of substrates linked to specific disease states or adverse drug reactions.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic research on CYP2C18 is far less comprehensive than for other CYP enzymes due to its low expression and the limited number of known substrates metabolized by this enzyme. However, understanding the genetic variations in CYP2C18 might provide insights into individual differences in drug metabolism for certain drugs, albeit its impact appears to be minor relative to other CYP2C family members. The enzyme does not currently have well-established pharmacogenetic associations with specific drugs, unlike CYP2C19 or CYP2C9, which are extensively studied for their roles in the metabolism of clinically significant medications. Continued research might elucidate rare but potentially relevant pharmacogenetic roles for CYP2C18 in drug metabolism.
