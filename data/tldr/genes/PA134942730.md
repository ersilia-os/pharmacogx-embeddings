## Gene Summary
KRTAP10-4, or keratin-associated protein 10-4, is a member of a large family of proteins associated with the keratin intermediate filaments in hair and nails. These proteins play a crucial role in forming the rigid and resistant structure of the hair shaft by contributing to the matrix that surrounds the keratin filaments. The specific function of KRTAP10-4, along with many keratin-associated proteins, involves defining the quality and texture of human hair, impacting its physical properties such as curliness, thickness, and manageability.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
KRTAP10-4 is principally expressed in the hair follicles and is predominantly involved in hair formation and structure. Currently, there are no direct associations of KRTAP10-4 with specific diseases. However, variations in this gene, like other KRTAP genes, could potentially influence hair phenotypes, contributing to differences in hair texture and properties across individuals. Pathways that are primarily involved include those related to hair keratinization and structural development.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there are no known pharmacogenetic associations involving KRTAP10-4 with specific drugs or therapeutic interventions. The geneâ€™s role is specialized in hair structure and does not typically intersect significantly with common pharmacological targets. However, future research in dermatological or cosmetic fields may explore the impact of genetic variations in KRTAP10-4 on the efficacy of treatments aimed at modifying hair properties or treating hair disorders. For now, pharmacogenetic implications remain largely uninvestigated for this gene.
