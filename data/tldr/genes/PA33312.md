## Gene Summary
PIK3R1, or phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1, is an important gene involved in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This gene encodes the p85Î± regulatory subunit of PI3K, which is crucial for modulating the activity of the p110 catalytic subunit. PIK3R1 has a significant role in cellular functions such as growth, survival, proliferation, and metabolism. It is widely expressed in various tissues, impacting various cellular processes and diseases due to its central role in cell signaling pathways.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Alterations in PIK3R1 have been linked to a number of diseases, including cancers such as breast, ovary, and endometrial cancers. Moreover, PIK3R1 mutations are associated with metabolic disorders and immune system dysfunctions. As this gene is a part of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, it is frequently studied in the context of oncology and targeted cancer therapies. PIK3R1 involvement in pathways also connects it to insulin signaling and cardiovascular diseases, indicating its broad physiological and pathological impact.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, PIK3R1 is significant in the context of cancer treatment, as its alterations can influence the effectiveness and adverse effects of various anticancer drugs. Drugs targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, such as copanlisib, idelalisib, and omipalisib, can have variable responses based on PIK3R1 gene variants. Understanding the genetic variations within PIK3R1 helps tailor personalized treatment plans in oncology, potentially improving therapeutic efficacy and minimizing toxicity. Thus, pharmacogenomic profiling of PIK3R1 can be crucial for optimizing the use of PI3K inhibitors in clinical settings.
