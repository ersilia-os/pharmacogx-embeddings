## Gene Summary
TPMT, or Thiopurine S-methyltransferase, is an enzyme encoded by the TPMT gene in humans. This gene is critical for the metabolism of thiopurine drugs, which are used primarily in the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. TPMT catalyzes the S-methylation of thiopurines, which is a crucial step in their biotransformation and inactivation. The activity of TPMT in the body varies significantly between individuals due to genetic polymorphisms, which can greatly influence drug efficacy and toxicity. Expression of TPMT is seen in various tissues including liver and red blood cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
TPMT is intimately associated with drugs like azathioprine, mercaptopurine, and thioguanine, which are commonly employed in the treatment of conditions such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and autoimmune disorders. Genetic variants in TPMT can lead to varying levels of enzyme activity and thus influence the risk of adverse effects and treatment outcomes. Individuals with reduced or absent TPMT activity are at increased risk for severe myelosuppression when treated with standard doses of thiopurines. The enzyme plays a role in the purine metabolism pathway, impacting drug metabolism and chemical carcinogenesis.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of TPMT is highly significant due to its impact on the treatment with thiopurine drugs. Variants in the TPMT gene can lead to low, intermediate, or high enzyme activity, and testing for these variants can guide dosing to optimize therapy and minimize toxicity. Particularly, genetic polymorphisms like TPMT*2, TPMT*3A, and TPMT*3C are well-documented and lead to decreased enzyme activity. Patients with these variants typically require reduced doses of thiopurines. For instance, patients harboring two non-functional alleles (homozygous) generally exhibit severe or potentially life-threatening myelosuppression when treated with conventional doses of thiopurines, necessitating substantial dose adjustments or alternative therapies. Given these associations, TPMT genotype testing is recommended prior to initiating therapy with thiopurine drugs to tailor treatment regimens appropriately and enhance patient safety.
