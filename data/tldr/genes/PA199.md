## Gene Summary
IL13 (Interleukin 13) is a cytokine mainly secreted by Th2 cells, but also by other cells such as mast cells and natural killer cells. Its primary role is in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses, particularly in the control and modulation of allergic reactions and asthma. IL13 acts by binding to its receptors IL13RA1 and IL4RA, initiating downstream signaling pathways that influence gene expression related to inflammation, fibrosis, and immune system function. The expression of IL13 is common in various tissues, particularly those involved in immune responses.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
IL13 is closely linked to many allergic and inflammatory diseases, including asthma, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis. It plays a significant role in the development of airway hyperreactivity and mucus overproduction. The cytokine is also implicated in fibrotic diseases due to its effects on tissue repair and fibrosis. In terms of pathways, IL13 primarily operates through the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, leading to changes in the immune environment of tissues. It promotes the class switching to IgE in B cells, an important factor in allergic disease pathophysiology.

## Pharmacogenetics
IL13's pharmacogenetic profile has been explored mainly in the context of asthma and allergic diseases. Variants within the IL13 gene have been associated with differential responses to treatments such as corticosteroids, which are commonly used in the management of asthma and other allergic conditions. In particular, changes in IL13 gene expression or function can modify the efficacy and outcome of these therapies. Drugs like lebrikizumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets IL13, have been developed to neutralize its activity, providing a more directed approach to treating severe asthma. Studies suggest that genetic variations in IL13 may influence the effectiveness of such targeted therapies, underlining the importance of IL13 in pharmacogenetics and personalized medicine approaches for managing complex immune-related diseases.
