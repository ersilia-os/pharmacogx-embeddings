## Gene Summary
IL17A (Interleukin 17A) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a critical role in immune responses, particularly in the activation and recruitment of other cells of the immune system such as neutrophils. This gene is predominantly expressed by a subset of T-helper cells called Th17 cells. IL17A is involved in inducing and mediating pro-inflammatory responses and is associated with the pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases. It works by signaling through its receptor, IL17R, to induce other pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and mediators of tissue damage.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
IL17A is directly implicated in the pathology of several inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. The cytokine is known to exacerbate inflammatory responses and has been a target for therapeutic intervention. In terms of pathways, IL17A is crucial in the IL-17 signaling pathway, which influences the JAK-STAT signaling pathway among others, impacting inflammatory responses. Therapeutically targeting IL17A has led to the development of biologics that inhibit its action, which are effective in treating various diseases associated with excessive IL17A activity.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the pharmacogenetics context, IL17A is most notable for its influence on the effectiveness and safety of drugs targeting IL-17 pathways, such as secukinumab and ixekizumab, which are used primarily for the treatment of psoriasis and other inflammatory conditions. Genetic variations in the IL17A gene can affect individual responses to these therapies, influencing both the efficacy and risk of adverse effects. Understanding the genetic profile of IL17A in patients can be crucial for personalizing treatment plans in order to maximize therapeutic efficacy and minimize potential side effects, particularly in the management of autoimmune diseases.
