## Gene Summary
NAMPT, short for nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, plays a critical role in cellular metabolism and longevity. It functions mainly as an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), which is essential for energy production and regulation in cells. NAMPT operates in two forms: an intracellular form that regulates NAD+ synthesis within cells, and an extracellular form that influences systemic NAD+ levels. It is widely expressed across various tissues but is particularly prominent in immune cells and adipose tissue. Its regulation of NAD+ not only affects metabolic pathways but also has implications in inflammation and aging.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NAMPT is implicated in several diseases primarily through its role in metabolic and inflammatory pathways. It has been closely studied in the context of metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity due to its involvement in energy metabolism. Moreover, its function in NAD+ biosynthesis ties it to aging and age-related diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. Elevated levels of NAMPT have been observed in various cancers, linking it to tumor growth and survival. NAMPT influences pathways like longevity signaling, inflammatory responses, and cell death, contributing to its wide-ranging effects on health and disease.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, NAMPT is of interest due to its role in mediating the efficacy and metabolism of drugs aimed at modulating NAD+ levels or its downstream effects. Drugs targeting NAMPT include FK866 and GMX1778, which inhibit the enzyme's activity, potentially offering therapeutic strategies for cancer by depleting NAD+ levels necessary for rapid cell proliferation. Moreover, the impact of NAMPT on inflammatory pathways suggests potential in treatments for autoimmune diseases. Current research efforts focus on understanding the genetic variations in NAMPT that may affect individual responses to these drugs, aiming to tailor treatments based on genetic makeup for better efficacy and reduced toxicity.
