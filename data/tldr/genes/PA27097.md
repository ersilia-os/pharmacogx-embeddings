## Gene Summary
CYP24A1, or Cytochrome P450 Family 24 Subfamily A Member 1, is an enzyme encoded by the CYP24A1 gene in humans. This gene is primarily involved in the metabolism of vitamin D, crucial for maintaining proper levels of calcium and phosphate in the body. CYP24A1 converts the active form of vitamin D (calcitriol) into its inactive metabolites, playing an important role in the fine-tuning of vitamin D physiology. It is predominantly expressed in the kidney but also found in various other tissues including the intestine, bone, and skin.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CYP24A1 is centrally involved in the vitamin D metabolism pathway. It is essential for the degradation of both 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the latter being the hormonally active form of vitamin D. Dysfunction or mutations in CYP24A1 have been associated with several diseases, including idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia and other disorders related to dysregulated vitamin D metabolism. Such disturbances can lead to conditions ranging from hypercalcemia to nephrolithiasis (kidney stones). The enzyme's role in maintaining vitamin D and calcium homeostasis links it indirectly to bone density and health, influencing susceptibility to conditions like osteoporosis.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic studies involving CYP24A1 primarily focus on how variations in this gene affect the metabolism of vitamin D and its therapeutic use. Due to its critical role in modulating the levels of active vitamin D, genetic variations can significantly influence the efficacy and safety of vitamin D supplementation and treatment strategies for conditions like osteoporosis, certain autoimmune diseases, and hyperparathyroidism. CYP24A1's polymorphisms can lead to alterations in enzyme activity, potentially requiring adjustments in vitamin D dosage to achieve desired therapeutic outcomes or prevent toxicity. Therefore, understanding an individualâ€™s CYP24A1 genotype might be beneficial in personalizing vitamin D treatment plans for better efficacy and minimized adverse effects.
