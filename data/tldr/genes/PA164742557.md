## Gene Summary
SULT1C2, which stands for Sulfotransferase Family 1C Member 2, is a gene involved in the phase II metabolism of drugs and endogenous compounds. It encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the sulfate conjugation of phenolic monoamines, as well as drugs and xenobiotics, making them more water-soluble and thus easier to excrete. SULT1C2 is predominantly expressed in fetal tissues, with smaller amounts found in adult kidney and liver. This enzyme plays a critical role in the detoxification and metabolic processing of various compounds within the body.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SULT1C2 is implicated in the metabolism of several drugs and environmental chemicals. Its role in disease is not as prominently characterized as some other sulfotransferases, but variations in this gene may affect individual responses to drugs, including those used in the treatment of cancer and hypertension. The enzyme encoded by this gene is involved in various biological pathways, including the metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 and the conjugation of drugs. It is part of the broader sulfotransferase enzyme family, which is involved in the sulfation pathway, a key process in phase II drug metabolism.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic relevance of SULT1C2 is emerging, though not as well-documented as other members of the sulfotransferase family. Variability in the SULT1C2 gene may influence the metabolism and efficacy of certain drugs, potentially leading to variations in drug response and toxicity among individuals. While specific high-impact pharmacogenetic interactions involving SULT1C2 are yet to be more fully established, the gene's expression and variations can be presumed to affect how individuals handle drugs metabolized through sulfation, indicating a broader implication in personalized medicine and drug dosing. More detailed pharmacogenetic studies are needed to substantiate the specific drugs and condition interactions and to utilize this information in clinical settings effectively.
