## Gene Summary
FLT1, also known as Fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 or VEGFR-1, is a protein-coding gene involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and vascular development. It encodes a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor family, primarily expressed in endothelial cells. FLT1 binds to VEGF ligands, predominantly VEGF-A, leading to receptor dimerization and activation of downstream signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation, migration, and survival. The gene plays a critical role in physiological processes like embryonic development and wound healing, as well as in pathological conditions such as tumor growth and metastasis.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
FLT1 is crucially involved in conditions characterized by abnormal angiogenesis, including various types of cancer (like breast and colorectal cancer) and chronic inflammatory diseases. As a component of the VEGF signaling pathway, FLT1 influences tumor angiogenesis, making it a target for cancer therapy. This gene is also linked to pre-eclampsia, a pregnancy complication associated with high blood pressure and damage to other organ systems. Several inhibitors targeting the VEGF pathways indirectly affect FLT1 activity, emphasizing its role in disease progression and therapy.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, FLT1 has been studied primarily in the context of cancer chemotherapy and targeted therapies. Drugs that inhibit FLT1, often in concert with other VEGF receptors, include multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like Sorafenib and Sunitinib. These drugs are used in treating renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and other solid tumors. Variants in FLT1 have been investigated for their potential to influence the efficacy and toxicity of these therapies. For instance, polymorphisms in FLT1 might modulate the therapeutic response to anti-angiogenic agents, affecting drug effectiveness and side effect profiles. Understanding these associations is crucial for the development of personalized medicine approaches in oncology.
