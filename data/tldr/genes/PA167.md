## Gene Summary
**FPGS** (Folylpolyglutamate Synthase) is a critical enzyme in the metabolism of folate, which plays a pivotal role in DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation processes. The enzyme catalyzes the addition of glutamate residues to folate and folate derivatives, producing polyglutamate forms that are retained within cells and are necessary for the enhanced activity and stability of folate-dependent enzymes. FPGS is expressed ubiquitously in various tissues, with vital implications in cellular proliferation and survival.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
FPGS is integral in the folate metabolism pathway and is linked to the efficacy and toxicity profiles of antifolate drugs used in chemotherapy, such as methotrexate (MTX) and pemetrexed. Disruptions in FPGS activity are associated with a range of diseases including different types of cancer, due to its role in DNA synthesis and repair mechanisms. Specifically, variations in the activity or expression of FPGS can influence treatment outcomes in cancers like leukemia and osteosarcoma, where folate metabolism is a therapeutic target.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, variations in the **FPGS** gene have critical implications, particularly in the efficacy and toxicity of antifolate chemotherapeutic agents. For example, genetic polymorphisms within FPGS can affect the drug response to methotrexate (MTX), commonly used in treating cancers and autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. Patients with certain FPGS genotypes may require adjustments in methotrexate dosing to avoid toxicity while maintaining therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, these genetic variations could potentially influence the treatment outcomes with other folate analogs and antifolates, highlighting the importance of considering FPGS genotypes in personalized medicine strategies.
