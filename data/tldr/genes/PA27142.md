## Gene Summary
DAPK1 (Death-associated protein kinase 1) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the serine/threonine protein kinase family. This kinase has a crucial role in apoptosis (programmed cell death) processes, influenced by its function in mediating caspase-dependent death signals. The protein is also involved in cellular processes including autophagy, cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal reorganization, primarily operating through interaction and phosphorylation of several protein substrates related to these pathways. DAPK1 is known for its expression in various tissue types but has prominently higher expression in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
DAPK1 is associated with cell survival and death mechanisms, which link it to several diseases such as cancer, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular diseases. The gene's role in promoting apoptosis makes it crucial for understanding tumor suppression, as loss of its function is often observed in cancers, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. Its interactions in cellular signaling pathways include connections with p53 signaling and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) related pathways. Studies have shown that alteration in the expression or function of DAPK1 might contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease through interaction with tau proteins contributing to neuronal death.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there are limited direct pharmacogenetic associations involving DAPK1 and specific drugs. However, due to its significant role in mediating apoptotic pathways, there is growing interest in exploring how drugs targeting apoptotic pathways might interact with DAPK1 expression or activity. Research into DAPK1 may influence future drug developments in oncology, specifically in designing drugs that can restore or modulate its function in cancer cells where it is typically downregulated or mutated. Understanding the pharmacogenetics of DAPK1 could potentially lead to tailored therapies that aim to reactivate the apoptotic pathways in cancer cells, enhancing the efficacy of treatments and possibly reducing adverse effects in therapies targeting cancer cell proliferation and survival.
