## Gene Summary
SSTR4, or somatostatin receptor type 4, is a gene encoding one of the five somatostatin receptors. This G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) binds somatostatin, a peptide hormone that regulates the endocrine system, affects neurotransmission, and cell proliferation by inhibiting the release of numerous secondary hormones. SSTR4 is widely expressed in the brain and in peripheral tissues, playing a pivotal role in mediating the inhibitory effects of somatostatin. Like other somatostatin receptors, it is involved in signal transduction pathways that lead to decreased cellular activity and proliferation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Although SSTR4 itself is not as commonly targeted directly by therapeutic drugs as some other somatostatin receptors, its natural ligand, somatostatin, and various synthetic analogs can influence its activity. Diseases and conditions associated with dysregulation of SSTR4 expression or function include neurological disorders where somatostatin and its receptors play modulatory roles. The pathways involving SSTR4 generally revolve around modulation of adenylate cyclase activity leading to changes in cAMP levels, influencing processes like hormone secretion, cell proliferation, and neurotransmission. 

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of SSTR4 is less characterized compared to other somatostatin receptors such as SSTR2 and SSTR5, which are more directly targeted in clinical therapy for conditions like neuroendocrine tumors. However, understanding variations in the SSTR4 gene might potentially contribute to personalized treatment strategies in neurological conditions or diseases where somatostatin plays a therapeutic role. The response to somatostatin analogs, which are used primarily in the management of acromegaly and neuroendocrine tumors, could be influenced by SSTR4 variations, although direct associations have yet to be robustly defined in clinical pharmacogenetics studies.
