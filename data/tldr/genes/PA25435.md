## Gene Summary
BST1 (Bone Marrow Stromal Cell Antigen 1) is a gene that encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol(GPI)-anchored protein, predominantly expressed on bone marrow stromal cells. BST1 is also referred to as CD157, which functions primarily as an ectoenzyme and signaling molecule. It plays significant roles in the regulation of pre-B-cell growth and in calcium signaling in immune cells. The protein encoded by BST1 is also implicated in neutrophil differentiation and adhesion. Diseases associated with BST1 include Sezary's Disease and T-cell Leukemia.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
BST1 is implicated in various diseases mainly relating to immune cell proliferation and differentiation. Its role in T-cell leukemia and other hematologic disorders highlights its function in immune system regulation. BST1 interaction pathways involve cellular processes like cell adhesion and responsiveness to external stimuli, primarily through its role in calcium mobilization. The associations of BST1 with inflammatory responses also connect it indirectly to diseases such as arthritis, where stromal cell-mediated bone remodeling is critical.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics research, BST1 has not been extensively explored for direct associations with drug responses or toxicity. However, its general role in immune system modulation suggests potential impacts on treatments targeting immune cells or pathways involving cell adhesion and signaling. For instance, drugs that influence calcium signaling in immune cells might variably affect individuals based on differences in BST1 expression or function, although specific drug interactions and genetic variations within BST1 needing deeper investigation to clarify these potential associations.
