## Gene Summary
CPT1A (Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase 1A) is a key enzyme in the mitochondrial oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. It is responsible for the transport of these fatty acids from the cytosol into the mitochondria by catalyzing the conversion of long-chain acyl-CoAs to acylcarnitines, which can then cross the mitochondrial membrane. CPT1A is primarily expressed in the liver, kidney, and heart where fatty acid oxidation predominantly occurs. The activity of this enzyme is crucial for energy production, especially during periods of fasting or exercise.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CPT1A is implicated in several metabolic disorders and clinical phenotypes. Notable among these is carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A deficiency, a condition that leads to an inability to utilize long-chain fatty acids for energy, resulting in symptoms such as hypoketotic hypoglycemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and risk for sudden death in infants. The gene is involved in the fatty acid metabolism pathway, playing a pivotal role in beta-oxidation of fats. Given its systemic importance in energy metabolism, mutations and dysfunction in CPT1A can have widespread metabolic implications.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of CPT1A primarily involves its associations with responses to dietary supplements and specific drugs. For example, the fatty acid oxidation disorder caused by CPT1A deficiency might be managed by medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) in the diet, bypassing the need for CPT1A activity. Variations in the CPT1A gene have been studied in the context of differential responses to diet and other therapeutic interventions in metabolic diseases. Understanding individual genetic profiles concerning CPT1A can guide dietary recommendations and treatment options in metabolic disorders, optimizing clinical outcomes based on genetic predispositions.
