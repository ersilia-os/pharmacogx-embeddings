## Gene Summary
SLC22A12, also known as URAT1, is an organic anion transporter predominantly expressed in the kidney's proximal tubules. Its primary function involves regulating the reabsorption of uric acid from the urine, playing a crucial role in maintaining body urate homeostasis. This gene facilitates the exchange of uric acid against anions such as chloride, effectively controlling serum urate levels and contributing to the kidneys' excretory and absorptive capabilities.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SLC22A12 is implicated in several medical conditions primarily associated with abnormal urate metabolism, including gout and renal-related disorders. Mutations in this gene can lead to hypouricemia due to defective renal uric acid reabsorption, highlighting its essential role in urate handling and gout pathogenesis. The gene's activity affects the renal clearance of uric acid, linking it to susceptibility to conditions like hyperuricemia when functionality is compromised. Pathway involvement primarily includes uric acid transport and metabolism.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of SLC22A12 is of significant interest due to its impact on the efficacy and safety of drugs that alter uric acid levels. Key drugs affected by variants in this gene include uricosuric agents like probenecid and lesinurad, which are used in the treatment of gout. These drugs work by inhibiting URAT1, leading to increased excretion of uric acid, and their effectiveness can vary based on the genetic variations within SLC22A12. Genetic polymorphisms in SLC22A12 can alter drug response, efficacy, and risk of adverse effects, necessitating consideration of these factors in personalized medicine approaches for treating gout and managing urate levels.
