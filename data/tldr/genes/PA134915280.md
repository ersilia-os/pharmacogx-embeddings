## Gene Summary
CD274, commonly known as PD-L1 (Programmed Death-Ligand 1), is a protein-coding gene, which plays a crucial role in the modulation of immune response. CD274 provides instructions for making a protein that is found on the surface of various cells including immune cells and cancer cells. The protein functions primarily in inhibiting the immune response by interacting with the PD-1 receptor on T cells, which are a type of immune cell important for fighting infections and cancer. This interaction leads to the suppression of T-cell activity, thus playing a vital role in preventing autoimmune diseases, but it also enables cancer cells to evade immune surveillance.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CD274 is closely associated with various forms of cancer, including lung, renal, melanoma, and bladder cancers. The expression of PD-L1 by tumor cells is a significant mechanism for immune resistance, particularly against T cells that are specific to tumor antigens. Moreover, the role of PD-L1 has been deeply studied in contexts of autoimmune diseases where inhibiting its interaction with PD-1 shows therapeutic potential. The pathways associated with CD274 primarily involve immune system regulation and tumor evasion mechanisms. Upregulation of CD274 is a key factor in immune checkpoint pathways, making it a prime target for checkpoint inhibitor drugs.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of CD274 largely deals with its role as a target for cancer immunotherapy. Drugs known as checkpoint inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and nivolumab (Opdivo), are monoclonal antibodies that specifically block the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1, thereby boosting the immune system's response against cancer cells. The efficacy of these drugs can depend on the expression levels of PD-L1 in tumors, which has led to the development of diagnostic tests to measure PD-L1 expression as a predictive biomarker for response to therapy. The pharmacogenetic associations indicate a varying response to these drugs based on CD274 expression, significantly impacting treatment choices and outcomes in oncology.
