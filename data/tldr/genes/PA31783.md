## Gene Summary
NRP1, or Neuropilin 1, is a human gene that encodes a protein involved in various physiological processes such as angiogenesis, cardiovascular development, and immune response. The geneâ€™s product is a type I transmembrane protein that functions as a receptor for both members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family and semaphorins, which are known for their roles in neural and cardiovascular development as well as in axonal guidance. NRP1 is expressed widely across multiple tissues and cell types, including neurons, endothelial cells, and immune cells, indicating its key role in nervous and vascular systems.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The NRP1 gene is implicated in several diseases, primarily due to its involvement in pathological angiogenesis and immune responses. Its aberrant expression or mutation has been associated with various types of cancers, including breast and prostate cancer, and with other diseases like diabetic retinopathy and rheumatoid arthritis. NRP1 also participates in diverse biological pathways including those of VEGF signaling, which is critical for new blood vessel formation and T-cell co-stimulation pathways, pivotal in immune responses. Given its role in angiogenesis and immune system regulation, NRP1 is a particularly important target in tumor growth and metastasis.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, NRP1's relevance is primarily explored in the context of cancer and ocular disease treatments. The gene's product, as a co-receptor for VEGF, makes it a potential target for anti-angiogenic therapies in cancer treatment. Drugs targeting the VEGF pathway, such as Bevacizumab (a VEGF-specific antibody), may have variable response rates based on individual differences in NRP1 expression or function. Furthermore, research suggests NRP1 variations could influence the efficacy of immunotherapies, due to its role in modulating immune checkpoint pathways. Studies are ongoing to better understand these associations and possibly enhance therapeutic strategies by considering NRP1 genetic profiles.
