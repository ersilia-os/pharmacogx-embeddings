## Gene Summary
NT5C1A (5'-nucleotidase, cytosolic IA) is a gene that encodes an enzyme involved in the metabolic processing of nucleotides. This enzyme specifically catalyzes the dephosphorylation of monophosphate nucleotides to their corresponding nucleosides, which is important for nucleotide salvage pathways and ultimately impacts various cellular processes including DNA and RNA synthesis. NT5C1A is primarily expressed in skeletal muscles and to a lesser extent in other tissues such as the brain and liver.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
While not prominently featured in discussions of typical drug targets, NT5C1A influences cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis, contributing to physiological and pathological states. The gene has been associated with myopathies and certain rare metabolic disorders. In metabolic pathways, NT5C1A plays a role in purine and pyrimidine metabolism, which are pivotal for cell growth and division. Aberrations in these pathways can lead to metabolic and degenerative muscle diseases.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, NT5C1A has not been widely studied in the context of direct drug interactions or influences. However, given its role in nucleotide metabolism, variations in this gene could hypothetically affect the efficacy and toxicity of drugs that are nucleotide or nucleoside analogs, which are used in the treatment of viral infections and cancers. These could include therapies involving antiviral or chemotherapeutic agents where nucleotide pools are a target or a factor in treatment efficacy. Further research could elucidate any specific pharmacogenetic associations that may guide personalized medical approaches based on NT5C1A gene variants.
