## Gene Summary
ACY3, or Aminoacylase 3, is a gene that encodes an enzyme involved in the deacetylation of N-acetyl amino acids to their corresponding free amino acids. This enzyme is localized primarily in the cytoplasm and is expressed in a variety of tissues, including kidney, liver, and brain. ACY3 plays a crucial role in metabolizing mercapturic acid pathway products, which are conjugates of glutathione that serve to detoxify harmful substances.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ACY3 is not predominantly known for its direct association with specific drugs or high-profile diseases. However, it is involved in metabolic pathways that process biochemical compounds, which can be indirectly related to disease phenotypes involving metabolic dysregulation. The enzyme's function in amino acid metabolism and detoxification pathways suggests a broader involvement in maintaining cellular health and function, potentially influencing conditions related to metabolic imbalances.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of ACY3 is not extensively studied, and its direct interactions with specific drugs through genetic variability are not well-documented in the current literature. Due to its role in the metabolism of conjugates in the detoxification pathway, variations in the ACY3 gene could hypothetically influence individual responses to drugs that are substrates for processes involving glutathione conjugation. Further research might elucidate specific pharmacogenetic roles, potentially impacting the optimization of therapies that interact with metabolic detoxification systems.
