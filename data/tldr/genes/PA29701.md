## Gene Summary
IGF2R, also known as the insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor, is a multifunctional protein widely involved in several biological processes. This receptor is primarily known for its role in mediating the uptake and degradation of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), a potent mitogenic and anti-apoptotic peptide that plays a crucial role in growth and development. IGF2R is a large transmembrane protein that interacts with mannose 6-phosphate (M6P)-tagged proteins, facilitating their trafficking to the lysosomes. Apart from IGF2, it also binds several other ligands, such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) precursors, M6P-containing proteins like lysosomal enzymes, and retinoic acid. IGF2R is vital for proper embryonic development and growth regulation, and is ubiquitously expressed in various human tissues, significantly in the liver, heart, and brain.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The IGF2R gene influences several disease states and physiological conditions due to its central role in cellular growth, development, and metabolic regulation. Importantly, mutations or alterations in IGF2R expression have been implicated in various cancers, including breast, liver, and ovary cancers due to its role in controlling IGF2 bioavailability, which can drive tumorigenic processes. Functionally, IGF2R has been associated with several developmental disorders when disrupted, demonstrating its importance in normal growth and developmental processes. Pathway analysis reveals that IGF2R is integral to the IGF2 signaling pathway, which affects cellular proliferation and apoptosis, and is linked to the M6P/IGF2 receptor signaling pathway that regulates lysosomal enzyme trafficking, impacting overall cellular homeostasis and health.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, the IGF2R gene has been studied less extensively in the context of direct drug interactions compared to its more studied IGF signaling counterparts (e.g., IGF1R). However, understanding variations in IGF2R may contribute to understanding differential responses to certain drugs, particularly those in cancer therapy that target growth factor pathways, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and monoclonal antibodies. While specific direct drug-gene interactions involving IGF2R are currently not well characterized, indirect effects through the regulation of IGF2 and its interaction with other components of the IGF signaling pathway, like growth hormone and IGF1R inhibitors, could potentially be affected by variations in this gene, influencing therapeutic outcomes in cancer treatment. Research into IGF2R pharmacogenetics could pave the way to improve personalized medicine approaches, especially in oncology where manipulating IGF signaling can be pivotal.
