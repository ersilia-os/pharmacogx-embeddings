## Gene Summary
SULT1C3, or Sulfotransferase Family 1C Member 3, is part of the sulfotransferase (SULT) family, which plays a critical role in the metabolism and elimination of drugs and endogenous compounds by catalyzing the sulfate conjugation of phenolic compounds. The actions of SULT1C3 specifically contribute to the metabolism of thyroid and steroid hormones, as well as xenobiotics, which includes drugs and environmental toxins. The expression of SULT1C3 is mainly observed in tissues such as liver and kidney, which are key sites for metabolism and excretion.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SULT1C3 is implicated in pathways involving the metabolism of hormones and drugs, which it achieves through the sulfation mechanism. This conjugation generally renders compounds more water-soluble, thus facilitating their excretion. Although research specifically on SULT1C3 is somewhat limited compared to other more widely studied sulfotransferase enzymes, the general function within this enzyme family suggests a role in pharmacokinetics and the detoxification of a wide range of substances. While no specific diseases have been robustly linked to genetic variants of SULT1C3, alterations in the activity of related SULT enzymes have been associated with certain cancers and metabolic diseases.

## Pharmacogenetics
The exploration of pharmacogenetics specifically relevant to SULT1C3 is still emerging. While detailed drug associations and variants with established clinical implications have not been as clearly defined as in other sulfotransferase members, the enzymeâ€™s role in drug metabolism suggests that genetic polymorphisms could potentially influence the efficacy and toxicity of medications that undergo sulfation. The pharmacogenetics of SULT1C3 might eventually provide insight into individual differences in drug metabolism, particularly for medications with chemical structures subject to sulfation. This potentially includes some antihypertensive drugs, certain hormonal therapies, and various over-the-counter medications. However, further research is required to clearly pinpoint specific drug interactions and optimize personalized medicine strategies involving SULT1C3.
