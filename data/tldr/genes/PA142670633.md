## Gene Summary
VAC14, also known as Vacuole membrane protein 1, is a critical component involved in the regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2) levels on cellular membranes. VAC14 acts as a scaffold protein in the PIKfyve complex where it binds to both PIKfyve and FIG4, ensuring the production and turnover of PI(3,5)P2, which is crucial for vesicle trafficking and the regulation of endo-lysosomal morphology. The gene is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, having key roles in maintaining normal cellular functions and structural integrity.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The alteration in VAC14 function has been implicated in several neurological disorders. Mutations and dysregulation of VAC14 are associated with complex neurological phenotypes such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and potentially other neurodegenerative diseases due to its role in neuronal function and survival. VAC14 is involved in pathways regulating membrane trafficking and autophagy, essential for neuron function and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Variants causing dysfunction in the PIKfyve complex can lead to neurodegeneration and abnormal neuronal morphology.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is limited specific pharmacogenetic information regarding VAC14 since it is not directly targeted by common drugs. However, understanding the genetic variations of VAC14 could potentially enhance the treatment strategies for diseases linked to its dysfunction. For instance, compounds influencing the PIKfyve signaling pathway might indirectly affect the function or expressivity of the VAC14 protein, thereby modifying disease phenotypes in disorders like Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease or ALS. Research into pharmacogenetics focusing on how genetic variance in VAC14 might alter response to such drugs remains an important area for future studies to enable personalized therapeutic approaches.
