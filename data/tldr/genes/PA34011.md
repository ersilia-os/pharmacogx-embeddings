## Gene Summary
PTPRC, also known as protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type C, is primarily recognized for its role in the immune system functioning. It is encoded by the PTPRC gene located in humans on chromosome 1. PTPRC is commonly referred to as CD45, a name derived from its identification as a cluster of differentiation molecule crucial for T cell and B cell receptor-mediated activation. The protein acts as a signaling molecule by regulating a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, and the immune response by functioning as an enzyme that dephosphorylates tyrosine residues on certain substrates, thus modulating signal transduction pathways.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
PTPRC is instrumental in numerous immunological pathways and is associated with several autoimmune diseases and immunodeficiencies. Due to its pivotal role in immune cell activation and function, mutations or dysregulation of PTPRC have been linked to diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and multiple sclerosis (MS). The gene is involved in key signaling pathways including T cell receptor signaling and B cell receptor signaling, both of which are critical for adaptive immune responses. Given its broad influence on the immune system, PTPRC impacts various immunological disease phenotypes including those seen in rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the realm of pharmacogenetics, research on PTPRC primarily focuses on its role in mediating the effect of drugs aimed at modulating the immune system. Recent studies have looked into the pharmacogenetic implications of PTPRC in treatments involving immune checkpoint inhibitors and other immunotherapies that are crucial in cancer treatments. These studies explore how variations in the PTPRC gene might influence patient responses to these therapies, given its essential role in lymphocyte activation. Although specific drug interactions are still under extensive investigation, understanding the genetic variations in PTPRC could lead to more personalized and effective treatment strategies in immunological and oncological diseases.
