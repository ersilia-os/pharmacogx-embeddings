## Gene Summary
SLC22A1, also known as the solute carrier family 22 member 1, encodes a protein known as organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1). This protein is integral to the plasma membrane and is primarily involved in the transport of organic cations across cell membranes. SLC22A1 is predominantly expressed in the liver but can also be found in the kidney, intestine, and other tissues. OCT1 functions by facilitating the uptake of endogenous compounds such as neurotransmitters, as well as drugs and toxins, from the blood into cells. The gene plays a crucial role in determining the pharmacokinetics of many clinically important drugs.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The protein product of SLC22A1 is implicated in multiple cellular pathways including drug metabolism and excretion. Abnormal function or expression of this transporter can influence drug efficacy and toxicity, which are critical in the context of personalized medicine. SLC22A1 has been studied in relation to various diseases, particularly those involving metabolic processes impacted by organic cations, such as diabetes mellitus and some neurological disorders. Variants in SLC22A1 have also been connected to inter-individual differences in susceptibility to certain diseases and response to therapies.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, SLC22A1 is of significant interest due to its role in modulating the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of many drugs. Variants in the SLC22A1 gene can significantly affect the function of OCT1, impacting the pharmacokinetics of drugs such as metformin, a commonly used antidiabetic agent. Other drugs influenced by OCT1 activity include tramadol, tropisetron, and ondansetron. Genetic variations in SLC22A1 can lead to reduced transporter activity, which may necessitate dosage adjustments to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize side effects. The understanding of SLC22A1 pharmacogenetics helps in the customization of drug treatments to achieve better clinical efficacy and safety.
