## Gene Summary
ADAMTS10 (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin Motifs 10) is a member of the ADAMTS family of zinc-dependent enzymes, which are known to play roles in processing of procollagen molecules and modulation of the extracellular matrix. ADAMTS10 is involved in the cleavage of various extracellular matrix components and therefore crucial in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues. Additionally, it has been implicated in growth and development processes including organogenesis. The gene is expressed in various tissues, but notably in the cardiovascular system and connective tissues.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ADAMTS10 has been associated with several genetic disorders, particularly Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS). WMS is a rare connective tissue disorder characterized by short stature, brachydactyly, stiff joints, and eye abnormalities including ectopia lentis. The disease linkage underscores the gene's significant role in connective tissue integrity and ocular development. In terms of biological pathways, ADAMTS10 is significantly involved in the regulation of extracellular matrix organization, signaling pathways influencing cellular structure, and potentially interacting with pathways of other ADAMTS family members.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, direct pharmacogenetic associations involving ADAMTS10 and specific drugs are not well-established in the literature. However, given its influence on extracellular matrix processes and implications in connective tissue disorders, future pharmacogenetic studies may explore potential interactions with therapies aimed at treating or managing extracellular matrix-related abnormalities, particularly in the context of rare genetic disorders like Weill-Marchesani syndrome. Understanding ADAMTS10's pharmacogenetic impacts could lead to more personalized and effective therapeutic strategies for affected patients, especially in precision medicine frameworks tailored to genetic profiles.
