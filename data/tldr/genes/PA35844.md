## Gene Summary
SLCO1B3 (Solute Carrier Organic Anion Transporter Family Member 1B3) is a gene that encodes for the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3). This protein is primarily expressed in the liver and is involved in the sodium-independent transport of a wide range of endogenous and exogenous organic compounds, including bile acids, hormones, and drugs. SLCO1B3 plays a critical role in the hepatic uptake of various substances from the blood, influencing their metabolism and excretion.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SLCO1B3 has been linked to the pharmacokinetics of several drugs, with variants in this gene affecting the disposition and efficacy of these agents. The transporter is known to interact with statins, anti-cancer drugs, and other medications predominantly cleared by the liver. Diseases associated with mutations or dysregulation of SLCO1B3 include Rotor syndrome, a rare inherited disorder affecting bilirubin transport and leading to conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Furthermore, aberrant expression of SLCO1B3 has been observed in certain cancers, potentially impacting tumor behavior and treatment responses.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic studies of SLCO1B3 have revealed significant correlations between gene variants and differential drug response, particularly with statins and anticancer drugs. For instance, the c.334T>G (p.Val411Ala) SNP in SLCO1B3 has been associated with altered plasma levels of statins such as atorvastatin and pravastatin, affecting both their efficacy and toxicity profiles. In oncology, variations in SLCO1B3 can influence the effectiveness and toxicity of taxanes and platinum-based drugs, key components in chemotherapy regimens. There is growing interest in utilizing SLCO1B3 genotyping to tailor therapeutic strategies and optimize drug dosing, aiming to enhance treatment outcomes and minimize adverse effects.
