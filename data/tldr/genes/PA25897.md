## Gene Summary
The C3 gene encodes for Complement Component 3, a central protein in the complement system, which is crucial for innate immunity. The complement system enhances (complements) the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear microbes and damaged cells, promote inflammation, and attack the pathogen's cell membrane. C3 is synthesized mainly in the liver and is composed of an α-chain and a β-chain. It plays a pivotal role in the activation of the complement system, being involved in all three pathways: classical, lectin, and alternative. Proteolytic cleavage of C3 results in C3a and C3b, with C3b being an active component in opsonization and phagocytosis, and C3a functioning as an anaphylatoxin, involved in eliciting inflammatory responses.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The functionality of C3 is closely associated with a variety of immune response-mediated diseases. Dysregulation or genetic mutations in C3 can lead to conditions such as Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Atypical Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (aHUS), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). These diseases underscore the role of C3 in immune complex stabilization and clearance. Overactivity of the C3 protein has been implicated in diseases characterized by excessive inflammation, whereas underactivity might lead to increased susceptibility to infections. Given its central role in the immune system, C3 is a target for therapeutic interventions in diseases involving the complement system. Clinical pathways involving C3 include the complement and coagulation cascade, which is critical in inflammation and immune defense mechanisms.

## Pharmacogenetics
Variations in the C3 gene can have significant pharmacogenetic implications, particularly in relation to the treatment of diseases like AMD and aHUS. For example, the use of Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the cleavage of C5 (a downstream protein in the complement cascade initiated by C3 activation), has shown effectiveness in treating aHUS by halting the uncontrolled complement activation due to C3 dysregulation. In AMD, which is partly driven by complement activation, modulation of the C3 interaction or signaling potentially represents a therapeutic target. Treatments aimed at controlling the overactivation of the complement system via C3 inhibition are under investigation. Additionally, genetic variations in C3 that influence the levels and activity of its products may alter drug efficacy or predispose individuals to particular side effects, hence impacting therapeutic strategies.
