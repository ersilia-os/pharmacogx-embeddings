## Gene Summary
ANXA11 (Annexin A11) is a gene encoding the protein annexin A11, which is part of the annexin family of calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding proteins. This gene plays a significant role in several cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking, signal transduction, and the regulation of cell growth and division. The protein is known to be involved in apoptosis and membrane organization, underscoring its significance in cellular stability and response mechanisms. ANXA11 is broadly expressed in a variety of tissues, including lung, heart, spleen, and kidney.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ANXA11 has been associated with several medical conditions, most notably sarcoidosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Sarcoidosis is a disorder characterized by the growth of tiny collections of inflammatory cells in different parts of the body, primarily the lungs. On the other hand, ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. The gene's involvement in disease is likely through its role in apoptotic processes and cellular management under stress. In terms of pathways, ANXA11 is involved in cellular response to calcium levels and apoptosis regulatory pathways, affecting cellular survival and function during stress.

## Pharmacogenetics
Current pharmacogenetic data linking ANXA11 directly with specific drugs is limited. However, understanding the role of ANXA11 in diseases like ALS and sarcoidosis suggests potential indirect implications for therapeutic areas. Drugs that modulate calcium signaling or apoptosis could potentially interact with the pathways regulated by ANXA11, although concrete evidence of such interactions and their clinical pharmacogenetic implications have yet to be fully explored in research. In ALS and sarcoidosis management, where immune-modulating and neuroprotective strategies are commonly employed, the protein's role might become an interesting target for future pharmacogenetic studies, thus potentially influencing drug development or therapy customization based on ANXA11 gene variations.
