## Gene Summary
IGF1R (Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 Receptor) is a protein-coding gene that encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase in humans. This receptor is primarily activated by the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and to a lesser extent by IGF-2. IGF1R plays a crucial role in growth and development, particularly influencing cellular growth, differentiation, and survival. It is widely expressed in various tissues but is particularly prominent in tissues where growth factors stimulate developmental processes. Structurally, the receptor is composed of two alpha subunits and two beta subunits linked by disulfide bonds, forming a heterotetrameric complex that undergoes autophosphorylation upon ligand binding.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The IGF1R gene is implicated in several physiological and pathological processes. Given its fundamental role in cell growth and survival, IGF1R has been associated with the development and progression of numerous cancers. Overexpression and dysregulation of IGF1R are common in cancers such as breast, lung, and prostate cancers, making it a target for therapeutic interventions. In terms of non-neoplastic conditions, alterations in IGF1R function can impact growth disorders and developmental anomalies due to its key role in growth signaling pathways. The pathway involvement primarily centers around the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, influencing processes like cellular proliferation and anti-apoptosis.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the realm of pharmacogenetics, the IGF1R gene has significant implications due to its role in mediating the effects of growth factors. Drugs targeting IGF1R, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g., linsitinib and figitumumab), are under investigation for treating various cancers. These inhibitors aim to block the receptorâ€™s kinase activity, thereby hindering downstream signaling that promotes tumor growth and survival. Personalized medicine strategies often consider the status of IGF1R expression or mutation in tumors to optimize therapeutic responses and tailor treatment plans. Additionally, genetic variations in IGF1R have been studied for their potential influence on drug efficacy and patient response, crucial for developing personalized therapies in oncology.
