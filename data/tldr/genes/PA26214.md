## Gene Summary
CD38, also known as cyclic ADP-ribose hydrolase, is a multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis and hydrolysis of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) from NAD+ to ADP-ribose. Primarily expressed on the surface of immune cells, CD38 plays a crucial role in calcium signaling, cell adhesion, and the regulation of other physiological processes. It is often used as a marker for activated lymphocytes and is significant in the study of immune responses.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CD38 is implicated in a variety of diseases, particularly in hematological malignancies such as multiple myeloma and some forms of leukemia. The expression of CD38 is commonly elevated in these cancers, making it a target for therapeutic interventions. Research has shown pathways involving CD38 in regulatory mechanisms related to immune responses and inflammation, which further connects it to autoimmune diseases and metabolic disorders like diabetes. The gene is also part of critical signaling and survival pathways in cells, influencing apoptosis and cell proliferation.

## Pharmacogenetics
CD38’s pharmacogenetic profile is highly relevant in the context of targeted cancer therapies. The gene’s product is a primary target for the monoclonal antibody Daratumumab, which is used in the treatment of multiple myeloma. Daratumumab binds to CD38 on the surface of myeloma cells, inducing cell death and enhancing immune-mediated clearance. Another related drug, Isatuximab, also targets CD38 and has been approved for similar indications in multiple myeloma therapy. These pharmacogenetic associations highlight the importance of CD38 not only as a biomarker for disease progression in hematologic cancers but also as a critical target for therapeutic interventions. The efficacy and safety of treatments targeting CD38 may vary according to the gene’s expression levels and the specific mutations in individual patients, underlining the importance of personalized medicine in this context.
