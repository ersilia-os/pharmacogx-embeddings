## Gene Summary
CD84, also known as SLAMF5 (Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family member 5), is involved in the immune system's regulation, particularly in the signal transduction processes that occur in immune cells. CD84 is primarily expressed on the surface of B cells, T cells, monocytes, and platelets. The protein functions as a homophilic adhesion molecule, which means it promotes interactions between the same types of cells. Binding of CD84 leads to the activation of various signaling cascades that enhance immune responses. It is part of the SLAM family, which plays crucial roles in modulating immune cell activation and interactions.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CD84 has been implicated in various immunological and hematological conditions, although direct links to specific diseases are not as well-characterized as some other genes in the immune system. The gene plays a role in pathways related to T and B cell activation, which are central to both adaptive and innate immune responses. Due to its expression in leukocytes and its role in cell signaling and adhesion, it has potential implications in immune system diseases, inflammatory responses, and potentially in autoimmune diseases. However, the specific pathways and interactions in disease contexts are still under active research.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is limited direct pharmacogenetic information available specifically linking CD84 with therapeutic drugs. Given its role in immune cell signaling and interaction, drugs that modulate immune responses could theoretically be influenced by variations in CD84 expression or function, but specific associations have not been robustly defined. Research in this area might reveal implications for immune-modulatory therapies, particularly in conditions where T and B cell function are dysregulated. Further studies could help clarify how CD84 could impact drug efficacy or safety in immune-related therapies.
