## Gene Summary
MT-RNR1, also known as mitochondrial ribosomal RNA 12S, encodes the mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA which is a component of the small ribosomal subunit. The MT-RNR1 gene is situated within mitochondrial DNA and plays a crucial role in the translation of mitochondrial-encoded proteins, which are essential for oxidative phosphorylation and energy production in cells. Beyond its fundamental role in protein synthesis, variants in this gene have been linked to a variety of mitochondrial dysfunctions given its critical involvement in cellular energetics and metabolism.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
MT-RNR1 is associated with several phenotypic outcomes and diseases, primarily linked to sensorineural hearing loss and mitochondrial dysfunction. Notably, alterations in this gene can lead to Non-Syndromic Hearing Loss and Deafness, Mitochondrial (NSHLDM), pointing to its vital role in cochlear function and inner ear cell metabolism. There is also evidence linking MT-RNR1 to certain cases of aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity, underlining a gene-drug interaction that can exacerbate the risk of hearing loss. The primary biological pathway involving MT-RNR1 is the mitochondrial translational pathway, crucial for the synthesis of proteins that constitute the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the realm of pharmacogenetics, MT-RNR1 holds significant importance due to its connection with aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as gentamicin and tobramycin. Specifically, certain variants in the MT-RNR1 gene can predispose individuals to aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity, a severe side effect resulting in permanent hearing loss. This association particularly concerns the m.1555A>G mutation which greatly increases susceptibility to this side effect when patients with the mutation are treated with these antibiotics. As such, genetic screening for MT-RNR1 mutations is highly recommended before administering aminoglycosides to mitigate the risk of irreversible ototoxic effects, illustrating a critical pharmacogenetic consideration in clinical settings to enhance personalized medicine approaches.
