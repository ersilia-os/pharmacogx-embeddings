## Gene Summary
DRD1 is the official symbol for the dopamine receptor D1, which is a member of the dopamine receptor subfamily of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. DRD1 is extensively expressed in the brain, particularly in the striatum, frontal cortex, and hippocampus. This receptor plays a crucial role in the regulation of neuronal growth and development, as well as the control of motor activity and cognitive functions. DRD1 predominantly works by activating adenylyl cyclase leading to an increase in cyclic AMP levels, which facilitates various downstream neuromodulatory processes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
DRD1 has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric conditions due to its central role in neurotransmission and brain function. Disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and drug addiction have shown associations with changes in the function or expression of this receptor. Furthermore, DRD1 is involved in Parkinson's disease, primarily mirroring its activity in modulating motor control pathways. Animal models and pharmacological studies featuring DRD1 modulation, highlights its importance in memory and behavioral flexibility, showcasing its wider implications in cognitive health and disease.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of DRD1 includes its interactions with various psychotropic drugs. Antipsychotics and other dopamine-modulating medications often target DRD1 pathways among others to remediate symptoms of disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Specific drugs such as Fenoldopam, a vasodilator used to treat hypertension, directly stimulate DRD1 receptors, demonstrating clinical utilization based on its pharmacodynamic profile. Additionally, genetic variations in the DRD1 gene can influence responses to these drugs, reflecting its potency and effectiveness in individual patients. Understanding such gene-drug interactions continues to be crucial in the development of tailored psychiatric and neurologic treatments.
