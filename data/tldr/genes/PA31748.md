## Gene Summary
NR1D1 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group D, Member 1), also known as REV-ERBÎ±, is a transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear receptor family of intracellular transcription factors. It is widely expressed in various tissues, prominently in the liver, adipose tissue, and the brain. NR1D1 plays a crucial regulatory role in maintaining circadian rhythm and metabolic homeostasis. It functions primarily by repressing the expression of key genes involved in metabolism and the circadian clock, acting through binding to specific DNA response elements in target gene promoters.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NR1D1 is implicated in several important biological pathways, including the circadian regulation of gene expression, lipid metabolism, and inflammation. Furthermore, dysregulation of NR1D1 has been associated with metabolic disorders such as hyperlipidemia, obesity, and diabetes, as well as mood disorders and sleep disturbances.
Pathway involvement includes the repression of BMAL1 (a core clock gene), influencing lipid metabolism pathways, and modulating inflammatory responses. Diseases linked to NR1D1 typically revolve around its role in these metabolic and circadian rhythm pathways, highlighting its therapeutic potential in treating related disorders.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the pharmacogenetics context, NR1D1 does not have a broad spectrum of direct drug associations but plays a significant role in the pharmacodynamics of drugs that target metabolic and circadian-related disorders. Drugs that modulate the activity of NR1D1 could potentially be used to treat disorders of circadian rhythms, such as certain sleep disorders, or metabolic diseases like diabetes and dyslipidemia. Recent studies suggest the potential for developing agonists or antagonists against NR1D1 to treat these conditions. Given its role in regulating metabolism and the biological clock, NR1D1 could influence the efficacy and toxicity of various drugs, indirectly affecting drug metabolism.
