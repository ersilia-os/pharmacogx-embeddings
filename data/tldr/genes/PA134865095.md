## Gene Summary
RHOA (Ras Homolog Family Member A) is a small signaling G protein related to the RAS superfamily. It plays a pivotal role in the regulation of various cellular processes including cytoskeletal dynamics, cell proliferation, migration, and cell cycle progression. RHOA works as a molecular switch, cycling between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state, influenced by different guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins. The gene expresses predominantly in many tissues, with higher expression in organs like the lung and spleas. Additionally, RHOA has been implicated in the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions, processes essential for maintaining and restructuring the cell shape and ensuring cell motility and division.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
RHOA is involved in several key signaling pathways, including those regulating the actin cytoskeleton, cell polarity, and gene transcription. Perturbations in these pathways due to dysfunction in RHOA activity or expression have been associated with diverse pathological states. Diseases linked with RHOA include various carcinoma types and developmental disorders. Its influence on actin cytoskeleton regulation makes it crucial in tumor progression, affecting cell migration and invasion abilities. RHOA mutations and their effects on pathway signaling have also been studied in context to neurodevelopmental disorders and cardiovascular diseases, underlining its role in developmental processes and contributing to disease phenotypes.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the realm of pharmacogenetics, research concerning RHOA mainly revolves around its role as a potential therapeutic target in oncology. Given its involvement in cell proliferation and migration, RHOA is a valuable target in cancer treatment strategies aimed at inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis. Drugs like statins, which are primarily known for their cholesterol-lowering effects, have been reported in some studies to impact RHOA-mediated pathways, potentially influencing cancer cell dynamics. Furthermore, RHOA is being explored in the context of targeted therapy with small molecule inhibitors designed to disrupt its function, thereby hindering cancer progression. Although currently more exploratory than clinical, understanding the interactions between drugs and RHOA-mediated pathways could advance personalized treatment regimens in cancers where RHOA signaling is aberrant.
