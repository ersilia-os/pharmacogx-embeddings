## Gene Summary
CHST13, or Carbohydrate Sulfotransferase 13, is an enzyme encoded by the CHST13 gene in humans. This gene is part of the sulfotransferase family, which is involved in the transfer of sulfate groups to various substrates, primarily carbohydrates and proteins, playing a critical role in modifying the extracellular matrix and cell surface molecules. CHST13 specifically mediates the sulfation of position 4 of non-reducing N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues in both N-glycans and O-glycans. Its expression is predominant in various tissues including the liver and kidney.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CHST13 is implicated in several biological pathways, primarily influencing the metabolism of glycosaminoglycans, which are important in processes such as cell signaling, cellular adhesion, and migration. Alterations in the function of CHST13 can impact glycan structures in the body, which can lead to pathological states, although specific diseases directly linked to CHST13 dysregulation are not well-defined in current literature. Research suggests a potential role in inflammatory responses due to its involvement in the regulation of glycan structures on cell surfaces.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there is limited information directly linking the CHST13 gene with specific pharmacogenetic interactions. No direct associations with specific drugs have been extensively documented or studied in the context of CHST13. However, the enzymeâ€™s broader role in modifying glycosaminoglycans suggests it could influence drug efficacy and metabolism, particularly in drugs targeting pathways involving cellular adhesion and migration. Further research could be valuable to elucidate the possible connections between CHST13 function or dysfunction and drug responses, especially in diseases where glycan structures play a pivotal role.
