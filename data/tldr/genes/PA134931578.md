## Gene Summary
VKORC1L1 (Vitamin K Epoxide Reductase Complex Subunit 1 Like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein similar to vitamin K epoxide reductase complex, subunit 1 (VKORC1). The protein is part of the vitamin K cycle, which is vital for the activation of clotting factors, certain proteins involved in bone metabolism, and other physiological processes. VKORC1L1, like VKORC1, may participate in the reduction of vitamin K 2,3-epoxide to the active vitamin K hydroquinone, thereby playing a role in the blood coagulation cascade. However, VKORC1L1â€™s specific physiological roles and tissue distribution still require further elucidation, as it is considered to have a broader tissue distribution and different enzymatic properties compared to VKORC1.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Despite its similarity to VKORC1, VKORC1L1 has not been as extensively linked to specific clinical conditions or drug interactions. The protein is involved in the vitamin K cycle and is essential for the carboxylation of glutamate residues in certain proteins, which is necessary for their activity. This pathway is particularly important in the synthesis of several blood coagulation factors. Mutations or alterations in similar pathways are typically associated with bleeding disorders or issues related to bone density, but specific diseases linked directly to VKORC1L1 are currently less documented.

## Pharmacogenetics
In terms of pharmacogenetics, VKORC1L1 has not been studied as extensively as its relative VKORC1, which is a major target of anticoagulant drugs like warfarin. VKORC1L1 could potentially impact the metabolism and effectiveness of such anticoagulants due to its role in the vitamin K cycle, though direct evidence linking VKORC1L1 variations with differences in drug response is limited. Nonetheless, understanding VKORC1L1 could contribute to broader insights into individual variations in drug metabolism and efficacy, particularly in the context of anticoagulation therapy. Future research may reveal more about its pharmacogenetic implications in drug response and personalized medicine approaches.
