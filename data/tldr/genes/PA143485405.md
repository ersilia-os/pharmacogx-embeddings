## Gene Summary
ELP5, also known as elongator acetyltransferase complex subunit 5, is part of the Elongator complex involved in transcriptional elongation and tRNA modification. It functions in the acetylation and modification of wobble uridines in tRNA, which is essential for accurate and efficient protein synthesis. ELP5, along with other elongator subunits, plays a critical role in neurological development and function. The gene is broadly expressed in many tissues with particular implications in the nervous system.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ELP5 has been implicated in several cellular pathways, primarily focusing on its role in protein synthesis and its impact on neurological functions. Mutations or dysregulation in ELP5 have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and potentially linked to neurological phenotypes like intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. The gene operates within the context of tRNA modification pathways and is crucial in maintaining the fidelity and efficiency of protein translation, which is fundamental in all cellular processes.

## Pharmacogenetics
While ELP5 is pivotal in fundamental cellular mechanisms involving tRNA modification and protein synthesis, direct pharmacogenetic associations involving specific drugs are currently limited in the literature. Further research may elucidate potential drug interactions or sensitivity related to ELP5 function, particularly concerning drugs affecting transcriptional processes or neurological conditions. Studies focusing on the broader Elongator complex may indirectly shed light on ELP5 pharmacogenetics, informing treatment approaches for related neurodevelopmental disorders.
