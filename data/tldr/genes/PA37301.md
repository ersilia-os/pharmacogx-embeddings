## Gene Summary
The official symbol VDR stands for Vitamin D Receptor, which is a member of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors. VDR plays a crucial role in the regulation of calcium metabolism, which is vital for normal bone formation and maintenance. This receptor is activated upon binding with vitamin D, specifically of the form 1Î±,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol), which leads to changes in gene expression that govern various biological responses. VDR is expressed in numerous tissues including bone, intestine, kidney, and thyroid, along with immune cells highlighting its broader role in the immune response and cellular proliferation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
VDR interacts with various agents due to its central role in vitamin D metabolism and signaling. The vitamin D pathway, in which VDR is directly involved, influences the action of drugs targeting bone disorders, such as osteoporosis. Diseases linked to VDR include rickets, osteoporosis, and potentially more complex conditions like autoimmune diseases and certain cancers. The expression and activity of VDR contribute to phenotypes related to bone density, calcium absorption, and immune modulation. Genetic variations within VDR are studied for their association with these phenotypic outcomes, particularly in response to vitamin D levels.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of VDR is significant mainly in the context of response to vitamin D itself and drugs affecting bone metabolism. Specific allelic variants in VDR have been associated with differences in the response to vitamin D supplementation, impacting bone density and calcium homeostasis. Furthermore, variations in VDR have implications in the efficacy and safety profiles of drugs used for treating osteoporosis, such as bisphosphonates. The genetic differences in VDR can influence the risk and progression of diseases such as osteoporosis and modify the clinical responses to vitamin D and related therapies. Understanding these associations helps in tailor-made therapeutic strategies and guides precision medicine in conditions related to vitamin D and bone metabolism.
