## Gene Summary
CYP2A6, part of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, plays a critical role in the metabolism of nicotine and cotinine, along with several xenobiotics and drugs. This enzyme is primarily expressed in the liver, but it is also found in the lungs and other tissues. It is known for its ability to catalyze the oxidation of various substrates, involving both activation and detoxification mechanisms. CYP2A6 variability affects smoking behavior and influences susceptibility to tobacco-related diseases due to its impact on nicotine metabolism speeds.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CYP2A6 is implicated in the metabolism of several clinically relevant drugs besides nicotine, including the antifungal agent terbinafine, certain antiepileptics, and chemotherapeutic agents like cyclophosphamide. Its activity is associated with various diseases, primarily those related to smoking and tobacco dependence, such as lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The enzyme is involved in key biochemical pathways like drug metabolism and the biotransformation of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450. Genetic variants in CYP2A6 influence the enzyme's activity and are linked to altered drug efficacy and risk of adverse effects.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, CYP2A6 plays a significant role due to its impact on the metabolism of nicotine and several therapeutic drugs. Variants in this gene can lead to altered enzymatic activity, influencing both therapeutic outcomes and the risk of side effects. For instance, reduced or increased CYP2A6 activity can alter the metabolism rate of drugs like warfarin, selegiline, and the chemotherapy prodrug cyclophosphamide, potentially necessitating dosage adjustments. Patients with certain CYP2A6 alleles exhibit different responses to smoking cessation therapies such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) where metabolism speed can predict the efficacy and side effects of treatment. Consequently, genetic testing for CYP2A6 variants can be critical in personalized medicine, especially in oncology and psychiatry.
