## Gene Summary
ADH1C (Alcohol Dehydrogenase 1C) is a gene that encodes one of the several isoenzymes responsible for metabolizing various substances, including ethanol, retinol, other alcohols, and lipid peroxidation products. The enzyme functions in the liver and is involved in converting ethanol to acetaldehyde, which is a crucial step in alcoholic metabolism. ADH1C, along with other members of the alcohol dehydrogenase family, plays a significant role in the metabolic pathways of alcohol and retinoid metabolism, influencing alcohol tolerance, dependence, and the risk of developing alcohol-related diseases.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ADH1C is implicated in several metabolic pathways, primarily alcohol metabolism and retinol metabolism. Variants and expression levels of this gene can influence the rate of alcohol and other substrates' metabolism, affecting systemic concentrations and impacts. Diseases associated with ADH1C include alcohol dependence and various alcohol-related pathologies such as cirrhosis and pancreatitis. The gene also has implications in metabolic response variations and susceptibility to alcoholic liver disease. Its activity is linked with the metabolic syndrome, which is partly influenced by the interactions of its metabolic products, like acetaldehyde.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of ADH1C is particularly relevant in the context of alcohol consumption and its related clinical conditions. Genetic variants of ADH1C affect the enzyme's metabolic rate of ethanol, thereby influencing an individualâ€™s susceptibility to alcoholism and other alcohol-related health issues. Certain alleles, such as ADH1C*1 and ADH1C*2, show significant differences in enzymatic activity; ADH1C*1 being more active, leads to faster oxidation of alcohol to acetaldehyde, which may contribute to higher peak blood acetaldehyde levels. This has implications on the side effects of alcohol consumption, risk of developing alcoholism, and also modifies the risk and severity of alcohol-induced liver diseases. Understanding these variants can also help in personalizing treatments for alcohol dependence and managing adverse effects effectively.
