## Gene Summary
CLCC1, or Chloride Channel CLIC-Like 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chloride channel activity. Though not as extensively characterized as other chloride channels, CLCC1 is believed to play a role in maintaining chloride ion homeostasis in various cellular processes. The CLCC1 protein is found across multiple tissue types, suggesting a generalized role in cellular function.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Research has implicated CLCC1 in certain neurological disorders, although specific pathogenic mechanisms or associations are not firmly established. It has been discussed in the context of neurodegenerative diseases where ion channels are dysfunctional. The protein's role in chloride transport suggests that it could influence cellular excitability and signal transduction pathways, potentially impacting conditions like epilepsy or neuropathic pain. However, there is a need for more direct evidence linking CLCC1 dysfunction to specific phenotypes or diseases.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of CLCC1 is currently underdeveloped, with little information available on direct associations between CLCC1 variants and responses to specific drugs. As a chloride channel, theoretical connections might be drawn concerning drugs that modulate ion channel activity, such as certain antiepileptics or anesthetics, but concrete evidence and clinical correlations are lacking. Further research could elucidate specific interactions that might make CLCC1 a target of interest in precision medicine, particularly in the treatment of diseases involving ion channel dysregulation.
