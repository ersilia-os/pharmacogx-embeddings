## Gene Summary
DHRS7C, officially known as “Dehydrogenase/Reductase 7C,” is a gene involved in the metabolism of steroid hormones, including the conversion processes between active and inactive forms of these molecules. This gene encodes an enzyme that belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) family, known for their role in the metabolism of a wide array of substrates, including steroids, retinoids, and lipids. DHRS7C is predominantly expressed in the liver and testes, indicating its potential importance in the metabolic functions and hormonal regulation specific to these tissues.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
DHRS7C is implicated in the metabolic pathways that regulate steroid hormone levels which can influence various physiological processes. Disorders in these pathways can potentially lead to abnormalities in steroid hormone homeostasis, which might contribute to conditions like hormone-sensitive cancers, metabolic syndrome, and other endocrine disorders. The exact pathways and mechanisms of DHRS7C-related diseases remain under investigation, and more research is needed to fully elucidate these connections. The gene’s role in liver and reproductive system health suggests its importance in these specific organ systems.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, the pharmacogenetic implications of DHRS7C are not extensively documented. No direct associations between DHRS7C and specific drugs have been established in terms of modifying drug efficacy or safety through genetic variations. However, given the enzyme’s role in steroid metabolism, it is plausible that future studies could uncover interactions between genetic variants of DHRS7C and drugs that target steroid hormone pathways, such as anti-androgens or estrogen modulators. This could have implications for personalized medicine approaches in treating hormone-dependent conditions. Further research would be required to define any specific pharmacogenetic roles for DHRS7C.
