## Gene Summary
CYP2C8 is a gene that encodes the Cytochrome P450 2C8 enzyme, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. The proteins encoded by these genes are involved in the synthesis and metabolism of various molecules and chemicals within cells. CYP2C8 specifically plays a critical role in the metabolism of a variety of drugs and endogenous compounds. It is primarily expressed in the liver. The enzyme encoded by CYP2C8 is involved in the oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics such as drugs and also participates in the metabolism of some endogenous steroids.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CYP2C8 is implicated in the metabolism of several important therapeutic drugs including paclitaxel, pioglitazone, and repaglinide among others. The enzyme's activity varies significantly among individuals due to genetic polymorphisms, which can affect drug efficacy and safety. Mutations in the CYP2C8 gene have been associated with varied drug metabolism rates, leading to differences in drug response among individuals. This gene is also a part of several biochemical pathways including drug metabolism - cytochrome P450 and metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins pathways. Variants in this gene have been studied for their associations with different drug responses and disease risks, such as increased susceptibility to therapy-related toxicities.

## Pharmacogenetics
CYP2C8 plays a significant role in pharmacogenetics, influencing the disposition and effects of several drugs due to its enzymatic activity. Key drugs affected by CYP2C8 include the anticancer drug paclitaxel, the antidiabetic drugs pioglitazone and repaglinide, and the antimalarial drug amodiaquine. Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2C8 can lead to altered enzymatic activity, impacting drug metabolism rates and, consequently, drug efficacy and toxicity. For instance, individuals with certain CYP2C8 mutations metabolize paclitaxel more slowly, potentially leading to increased toxicity. Conversely, other variants can lead to accelerated metabolism, possibly reducing drug effectiveness. Knowledge of a patient's CYP2C8 genotype can be crucial in optimizing dosages to maximize therapeutic effects while minimizing adverse effects, highlighting the importance of CYP2C8 in personalized medicine.
