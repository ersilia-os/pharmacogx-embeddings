## Gene Summary
IL23R, which stands for Interleukin 23 Receptor, encodes a protein that is part of the receptor for interleukin 23 (IL23), a cytokine involved in inflammatory processes. This receptor is composed of this protein and the interleukin 12 receptor, beta 1 subunit. IL23R is expressed on the surface of immunological cells such as T cells, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells. Activation of this receptor leads to the proliferation of Th17 cells, which play a crucial role in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
IL23R is notably associated with several autoimmune disorders, including psoriasis, Crohn's disease, and ankylosing spondylitis. The gene plays a vital role in the IL-23/IL-17 pathway, which has been targeted therapeutically in recent years to manage these diseases. Due to its central function in the immune system modulation, IL23R influences inflammation and has been linked to pathways that regulate immune response and autoimmune pathology. 

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, IL23R is essential mainly because of its involvement in the effectiveness and response to biologics targeting the IL-23/IL-17 pathway. Drugs such as ustekinumab (which targets both IL-12 and IL-23) and newer selective IL-23 inhibitors like guselkumab and risankizumab are particularly notable. Genetic variations in IL23R have been associated with differential responses to these treatments. For instance, certain polymorphisms in IL23R are linked to a better response to ustekinumab in patients with psoriasis. This highlights the significant role of IL23R in personalized medicine and the tailored treatment of inflammatory conditions.
