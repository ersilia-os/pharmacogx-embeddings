## Gene Summary
CORO7, officially designated as "Coronin 7," is a member of the coronin family of actin-binding proteins, which are known for their role in regulating actin-dependent processes in cells, such as motility and cell division. The protein encoded by CORO7 is thought to be primarily involved in the intracellular trafficking processes, specifically endosomal trafficking. Research suggests that CORO7 ensures proper protein transport within the cell and may be involved in the modulatory functions within cellular compartments like the Golgi apparatus or endosomes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Though detailed studies on CORO7 concerning specific drugs and diseases are relatively sparse, mutations or dysregulation in this gene have been linked to some cellular dysfunctions and phenotypic anomalies. CORO7 expression abnormalities might be implicated in certain neurological disorders due to its role in trafficking processes essential for neuronal function. The gene's product is involved in pathways regulating cytoskeletal organization and has been implicated in processes related to cell shape and structure maintenance. Understanding of the specific pathways involving CORO7 could illuminate new aspects of cellular pathology related to actin-cytoskeleton disorders.

## Pharmacogenetics
As of the current scientific literature, direct pharmacogenetic associations regarding CORO7 with specific therapeutic drugs have not been well established. The gene does not prominently feature in pharmacogenetic databases, indicating a lack of well-documented interactions with pharmaceutical agents. Future in-depth studies are crucial to potentially uncover any pharmacogenetic relevance of CORO7, particularly in the context of conditions that involve cellular trafficking and cytoskeletal anomalies, which could open new therapeutic pathways for modulation by specific drugs targeting these mechanisms.
