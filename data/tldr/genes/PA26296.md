## Gene Summary
CDH23, or Cadherin 23, is a gene that encodes for a calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion glycoprotein. This protein is part of the cadherin superfamily and is critical in mediating adhesive interactions necessary for the formation and maintenance of tissues. CDH23 is particularly notable for its role in the hair cells of the inner ear, where it is a component of tip links, structures that convey tension in the sensory hair cells, which is essential for the mechanotransduction process that converts mechanical stimuli into electrical signals. Expression of CDH23 is predominantly found in the retina and auditory epithelium, underscoring its role in both hearing and vision.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in the CDH23 gene are linked to a range of auditory and visual impairments. Specifically, alterations in this gene have been implicated in Usher syndrome type 1D and nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB12), both of which involve sensorineural hearing loss. In Usher syndrome, hearing loss is accompanied by retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative condition of the retina leading to progressive vision loss. Pathways involving CDH23 primarily include those related to the sensory perception of sound and the organization of the photoreceptor synaptic layer, impacting both auditory and visual processes.

## Pharmacogenetics
Research into the pharmacogenetics of CDH23 is still emerging, primarily focusing on understanding the genetic basis and pathophysiology of diseases associated with CDH23 mutations rather than direct pharmacogenetic interactions. However, recognizing specific mutations in CDH23 can be crucial for genetic counseling and managing expectations for the progression in diseases like Usher syndrome and nonsyndromic hearing loss. Currently, no direct pharmacogenetic associations involving specific drug responses or treatments have been firmly established for CDH23. Future research may explore if modulation of CDH23 function or expression could be relevant in therapeutic contexts, especially for sensory impairments.
