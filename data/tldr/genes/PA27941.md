## Gene Summary
F11, also known as Coagulation Factor XI, is a crucial component in the blood coagulation pathway, primarily involved in the intrinsic pathway of blood clot formation. The gene encodes a zymogen, Factor XI, which is a plasma protein that gets converted to the active serine protease, Factor XIa, through proteolytic cleavage. This enzyme plays a key role in the activation of Factor IX, another coagulation factor, which subsequently participates in the conversion of Factor X to the active form, Factor Xa. Factor XI is mainly synthesized in the liver and circulated in the plasma.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations and alterations in the F11 gene are primarily associated with Factor XI deficiency, a condition that can lead to a bleeding disorder known as Hemophilia C. Unlike Hemophilia A and B, which are characterized by deficiencies in Factor VIII and IX respectively, Hemophilia C typically presents with a mild bleeding phenotype but can vary significantly between individuals. Mechanistically, F11 is directly involved in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation, interfacing with several other coagulation factors to maintain hemostasis. The phenotype of Factor XI deficiency can vary widely, from no symptoms to severe bleeding challenges, particularly in surgical or trauma contexts.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of F11 primarily concerns the management and treatment of bleeding disorders associated with Factor XI deficiency. While direct pharmacological targets specific to F11 are limited, understanding individual genetic variations in F11 can inform the use of general anticoagulation therapy. For instance, patients with severe Factor XI deficiency might require Factor XI concentrates during surgical procedures to prevent excessive bleeding. Furthermore, there is interest in the role of Factor XI inhibition in reducing thrombosis risk without significantly impacting hemostatic capacity, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies that exploit F11's pharmacogenetic profiles for broader anticoagulant applications. Specific drugs have not been targeted directly at modifying F11 activity, but the gene's role in coagulation pathways makes it an indirect target of broader anticoagulent therapies.
