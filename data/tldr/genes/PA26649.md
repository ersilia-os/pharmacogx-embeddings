## Gene Summary
SBF2, also known as SET binding factor 2, is a gene implicated in the molecular framework that governs the architecture and function of cells, predominantly in neural and muscular structures. SBF2 is part of the myotubularin-related proteins that are known to be involved in intracellular signaling pathways, particularly those regulating PI3K-related kinases. The protein encoded by SBF2 is thought to function in nerve fiber myelination and has been linked to the maintenance of muscle and neuronal integrity. Expression of SBF2 is especially significant in neurological tissues.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SBF2 has been primarily associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, specifically type 4B2, which is a disorder characterized by neuropathy with varying degrees of muscle weakness and atrophy, as well as sensory problems. The disease is genetically inherited and manifests in abnormalities in nerve structure and function, often due to defective myelination of peripheral nerves. SBF2 mutations cause disruptions in cellular processes such as endosomal trafficking and phosphoinositide metabolism, which are crucial for cell membrane composition and function. These mutations lead to the phenotypic characteristics observed in the associated neuropathy.

## Pharmacogenetics
Current pharmacogenetic insights into SBF2 are primarily associated with its role in the pathogenesis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and its implications for therapeutic intervention, rather than direct associations with specific drugs. However, understanding the genetic basis and the molecular pathways influenced by SBF2 can aid in the development of targeted therapies that might involve modulation of lipid metabolism pathways or enhancement of myelination. Although specific drugs targeting SBF2 mutations are not yet highlighted in clinical pharmacogenetics, ongoing research is expected to eventually identify potential pharmacological interventions based on SBF2 genetic profiles.
