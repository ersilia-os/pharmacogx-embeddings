## Gene Summary
G6PD, or Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the pentose phosphate pathway, a metabolic pathway that supplies reducing energy to cells (via NADPH) and contributes to the formation of ribose 5-phosphate (a precursor for the synthesis of nucleotides). G6PD is particularly important for the normal processing of carbohydrates and is critical in red blood cells where it protects them from damage and destruction. The gene is highly expressed in the liver, kidney, and erythrocytes. Deficiencies in G6PD can lead to hemolytic anemia triggered by stresses such as infections, certain foods, and medications.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Deficiency in G6PD is linked to various clinical manifestations, including neonatal jaundice, acute hemolytic anemia, and chronic hemolytic anemia. This condition is known as G6PD deficiency, which is the most common enzyme deficiency worldwide, affecting more than 400 million people. It is more prevalent in certain malaria-endemic regions, an evolutionary adaptation thought to confer some protection against malaria. G6PD is part of the pentose phosphate pathway, which is integral in maintaining redox balance and producing nucleotides and nucleic acids. The enzymeâ€™s activity is also relevant to certain chemotherapy drugs and antibacterial agents.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, the significance of G6PD primarily centers on its role in drug-induced hemolysis. Individuals with G6PD deficiency have increased sensitivity to a range of drugs that can trigger hemolysis. Prominent examples include antimalarials such as primaquine and chloroquine, certain antibiotics like dapsone and sulfa drugs, and some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The reaction to these drugs can range from mild anemia to severe life-threatening hemolysis, necessitating that those with G6PD deficiency avoid these triggers. Additionally, variant alleles of G6PD, which can differ widely in their impact on enzyme activity, affect the severity and specific drug sensitivities, making genetic testing a critical tool for personalized medicine in populations at risk.
