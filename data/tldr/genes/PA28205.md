## Gene Summary
FOLH1, or folate hydrolase (prostate-specific membrane antigen) 1, is a gene crucial for the hydrolysis and activation of folate derivatives, which are essential for various metabolic processes, including nucleotide biosynthesis and methylation reactions. FOLH1 is located on chromosome 11p11.2 and encodes for the enzyme glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII). This enzyme is highly expressed in the prostate as well as in the tissues of the central nervous system and small intestine. It is particularly relevant for its role in the cleavage of N-acetyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamate (NAAG), influencing neurotransmitter activity and folate metabolism.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The FOLH1 gene is implicated in a range of biological pathways including folate metabolism, amino acid and peptide metabolism, and neurotransmitter regulation. Alterations or mutations in this gene can lead to dysregulation of these pathways, impacting neurological functions and potentially contributing to disease states such as schizophrenia, neuropathic pain, and certain cancers, notably prostate cancer. The expression of FOLH1, particularly its role in folate metabolism, also makes it a target for the development of specific inhibitors used as imaging agents or therapeutic tools in cancer treatments.

## Pharmacogenetics
FOLH1 pharmacogenetics predominantly focuses on its implications in cancer treatment, especially prostate cancer. The enzyme encoded by FOLH1, PSMA, is a target for several therapeutic approaches. Drugs such as lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan (Pluvicto) are designed to bind to PSMA and deliver targeted radiotherapy explicitly focused on prostate cancer cells overexpressing PSMA. Moreover, the gene's role in folate metabolism can influence the effectiveness and toxicity of antifolate drugs used generally in cancer chemotherapy, such as methotrexate, although direct genetic associations specific to individual responses are still under study. Thus, understanding variations in the FOLH1 gene can potentially enhance the efficacy of treatment modalities and refine personalized medicine strategies in oncology.
