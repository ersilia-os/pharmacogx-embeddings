## Gene Summary
AHRR (Aryl-Hydrocarbon Receptor Repressor) is a gene that encodes a transcriptional regulator involved in the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for mediating the toxic effects of dioxins and related compounds. AHRR acts as a negative feedback regulator by repressing the expression of genes induced by the AhR, such as CYP1A1, which is involved in xenobiotic metabolism. The protein is expressed in various tissues, with significant roles in developmental processes and response to environmental toxins.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The AHRR gene is implicated in several biological pathways and processes. It is primarily recognized for its involvement in the AhR signaling pathway, which plays a pivotal role in responding to environmental pollutants, like dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). AHRR also contributes to regulatory processes related to cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Although not directly linked to specific drugs, AHRR's modulation of CYP1A1 expression affects the metabolic activation and detoxification of various pharmaceuticals and carcinogens. The gene's function has been studied in the context of diseases like cancer, particularly lung cancer, where AHRR methylation status has been associated with risk and prognosis.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, AHRR primarily comes into focus due to its influence on drug metabolism pathways via the AhR signaling axis. The repression of CYP1A1—a key enzyme involved in the metabolism of drugs like theophylline and clozapine—by AHRR can potentially affect drug efficacy and toxicity. Indirect pharmacogenetic implications of AHRR are observed through its involvement in the metabolization and bioactivation of various carcinogens, which can modify cancer risk and treatment outcomes in individuals exposed to environmental toxins like tobacco smoke. Although specific drug associations are not extensively detailed, the understanding of AHRR's regulatory mechanics on CYP1A1 provides a foundational insight into its potential impact on interindividual differences in drug responses, particularly in drugs metabolized by CYP enzymes.
