## Gene Summary
ACTG1 (Actin Gamma 1) is a gene that encodes a highly conserved protein belonging to the actin family, specifically the cytoskeletal actins. It is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues but is particularly abundant in muscle cells and the inner ear. The ACTG1 protein plays a crucial role in the formation of cytoskeletal structures, which are essential for cellular processes like mobility, stability, intracellular transport, and cell division. Mutations in ACTG1 are most notably implicated in non-syndromic hearing loss, demonstrating the gene’s importance in auditory function.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ACTG1 is linked primarily to its role in cellular architecture and motility but has broader implications in various pathological conditions. The gene is associated with Baraitser-Winter syndrome, which presents congenital anomalies including craniofacial malformations and brain abnormalities. ACTG1 mutations are critically involved in autosomal dominant progressive hearing loss, particularly affecting cochlear hair cells’ structure and function. The gene functions through pathways concerning actin filament-based processes, contributing to diverse cellular mechanisms from adherence and motility to signaling cascades. Additionally, disturbances in ACTG1 can impact cellular mechanisms underlying certain cancers and potentially other proliferative diseases.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, ACTG1 does not have direct associations with specific drugs or responses to pharmacological treatments. However, understanding its role in cellular motility and integrity can be crucial when considering drugs that target cytoskeletal components, such as those used in cancer therapies. Furthermore, since ACTG1 mutations can influence cellular properties like migration and adhesion, it indirectly affects tumor behavior and consequently, the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs that target these properties. Monitoring and potentially targeting ACTG1 may provide therapeutic advantages in managing the progression of diseases associated with cellular structural abnormalities.
