## Gene Summary
DCK, or Deoxycytidine Kinase, is an enzyme pivotal in the nucleoside salvage pathway, catalyzing the phosphorylation of deoxycytidine, deoxyguanosine, and deoxyadenosine. DCK adds the first phosphate group, converting these nucleosides into their monophosphate forms, which are necessary precursors for DNA synthesis. The gene is expressed in various tissues but shows higher expression levels in proliferative tissues such as bone marrow and lymphoid organs. This expression pattern underlines its critical role in DNA repair and cell proliferation.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
DCK is directly involved in the metabolism of several anticancer and antiviral drugs. Its function affects the activation of chemotherapeutic agents such as gemcitabine, clofarabine, and cladribine. Due to its role in drug metabolism, DCK is linked to the therapeutic effectiveness and toxicity of these drugs. The gene's malfunction or altered expression is associated with resistance to chemotherapy in various cancers, including leukemia and lymphoma. In terms of pathways, DCK is a key component in the purine metabolism and pyrimidine metabolism pathways, crucial for DNA synthesis and repair processes.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of DCK is particularly significant in cancer treatment. Variations in the DCK gene can influence the effectiveness of nucleoside analog-based therapies. For example, specific polymorphisms in DCK have been associated with altered response rates to drugs like gemcitabine, used in pancreatic, breast, and non-small cell lung cancer. Studies have shown that certain DCK gene variants can lead to either an enhanced or reduced activation of these drugs, affecting their efficacy and toxicity. This makes DCK a potential biomarker for predicting patient response to nucleoside analogs in chemotherapy, highlighting the importance of personalized medicine approaches in oncology based on DCK pharmacogenetics.
