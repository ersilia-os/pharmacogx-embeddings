## Gene Summary
DOK5, or docking protein 5, belongs to the DOK family proteins that function as adaptors in various signaling pathways. This gene encodes a member important in the insulin signaling pathway and neural tissue development. DOK5 is mainly expressed in tissues such as the brain and muscle and participates in tyrosine kinase receptor signaling. Its activation and interaction are significant mainly for neuronal and muscular developmental processes, facilitating specific downstream signaling that promotes cellular differentiation and growth.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
DOK5 is implicated in pathways related to its role in neural development and the insulin signaling pathway which can shed light on its involvement in diseases like diabetes, obesity, and neurological disorders. Disruption in DOK5 function or expression may influence phenotypes associated with neuronal growth defects potentially leading to developmental delays or neurodegenerative diseases. The research also tentatively links it to conditions such as insulin resistance although more evidence is needed to firmly establish direct connections to specific diseases.

## Pharmacogenetics
In terms of pharmacogenetics, DOK5 has not been widely studied compared to other more prominent pharmacogenetic targets. However, given its role in the insulin signaling pathway, it could potentially be relevant in the pharmacogenetics of diabetes treatments in the future. Drugs that modulate insulin pathways might have variable efficacy depending on individual variations in the DOK5 gene. As research advances, understanding the genetic variations in DOK5 could contribute to personalized medicine approaches in treating diseases like diabetes or certain neurological disorders where the signaling pathways involving DOK5 play a role.
