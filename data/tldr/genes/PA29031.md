## Gene Summary
GSTZ1, or Glutathione S-transferase zeta 1, is an enzyme that belongs to the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family, which plays a significant role in cellular detoxification. GSTZ1 is involved in the biotransformation of toxic compounds, including haloalkanes, haloalkenes, and alkenyl carbonyls, by catalyzing their conjugation with glutathione. It specifically catalyzes the irreversible biotransformation of maleylacetoacetate to fumarylacetoacetate, a critical step in the catabolic pathway of phenylalanine and tyrosine. GSTZ1 is expressed in a variety of tissues, with higher levels found in the liver.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
GSTZ1 is implicated in several biological pathways, primarily those involving drug metabolism and the degradation of aromatic compounds. Notably, it participates in the phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan degradation pathways. Aberrations in GSTZ1 function or expression can lead to disorders like tyrosinemia, a rare disease characterized by elevated levels of tyrosine in the blood. Moreover, variations in GSTZ1 activity have been associated with a susceptibility to various toxicities and response to environmental pollutants.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of GSTZ1 mainly concern its role in drug metabolism and the implications of genetic polymorphisms on drug effects and toxicities. Several GSTZ1 variants are known to exist that can alter enzyme activity and affect the metabolism of substrates. This can influence not only the detoxification processes but also the efficacy and toxicity of drugs that are substrates for this enzyme. For instance, altered GSTZ1 activity has been suggested to impact the metabolism of dichloroacetic acid, used in the treatment of lactic acidosis, potentially affecting drug efficacy and risk of side effects. It highlights the importance of considering GSTZ1 genetic variants when administering drugs that are metabolized by this enzyme to optimize therapy and minimize adverse effects.
