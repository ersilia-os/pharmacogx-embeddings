## Gene Summary
HLA-DQB1 (Human Leukocyte Antigen DQ Beta 1) is a gene located on chromosome 6 and is part of the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II). It plays a crucial role in the immune system by presenting peptide antigens to T cells, which is essential for the immune response to pathogens. HLA-DQB1 is highly polymorphic, which influences its function in antigen presentation. This gene's expression is most prominent in immune system cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
HLA-DQB1 is associated with several autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, and multiple sclerosis. Specific alleles of this gene can either increase the risk of developing these diseases or protect against them. The gene is also involved in the immune response to various pathogens, making it crucial in infectious disease susceptibility and outcomes. HLA-DQB1 operates within the MHC class II pathway, involved in the exogenous pathway of antigen processing and presentation, critical for activating helper T cells, a subset of T cells that aid in orchestrating the immune response.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, HLA-DQB1 has notable associations with drug hypersensitivity reactions. For example, the HLA-DQB1*06:02 allele is strongly linked with hypersensitivity to the drug abacavir, used to treat HIV. Individuals carrying this allele are at significantly increased risk for developing abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome, an adverse drug reaction that can be severe and life-threatening. Therefore, genetic testing for HLA-DQB1*06:02 is recommended before initiating abacavir treatment. This is a prime example of how HLA-DQB1 genotype can be critical in guiding therapeutic decisions to avoid serious drug reactions.
