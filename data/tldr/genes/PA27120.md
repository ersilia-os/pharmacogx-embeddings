## Gene Summary
CYP4F11 (Cytochrome P450 Family 4 Subfamily F Member 11) is part of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes, crucial for drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids, and other lipids. This specific isoform is expressed in liver and kidney, and is known for its broad substrate specificity, involving fatty acids, eicosanoids, and endogenous lipids. CYP4F11 also participates in drug metabolism, converting therapeutically relevant drugs into less active or more readily excreted forms. 

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CYP4F11 is implicated in several biochemical pathways, including the metabolism of fatty acids and the biosynthesis of lipid mediators like leukotrienes. Its role in drug metabolism suggests relevance to drug efficacy and toxicity. Mutations or variants in CYP4F11 have been suggested to contribute to diverse clinical implications such as altered drug responses and metabolic dysfunctions. Diseases associated with disruptions or dysregulation in this gene include hereditary hypertension and lipid metabolism disorders.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, CYP4F11 is significant in influencing the metabolism of various drugs, which can affect both therapeutic efficacy and risk of adverse effects. For example, its activity can alter the pharmacokinetic profiles of certain antiepileptic drugs and NSAIDs, making its genetic variations important in personalized medicine. While specific drugs majorly influenced by CYP4F11 have not been as extensively documented as those for other CYP450 enzymes, understanding its role in drug metabolism helps guide more effective and safer therapeutic practices based on individual genetic makeup.
