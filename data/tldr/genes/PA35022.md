## Gene Summary
TAP2, or "Transporter 2, ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member", is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. It plays a crucial role in the adaptive immune response. TAP2 functions in conjunction with TAP1 to transport peptides from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum. These peptides are then loaded onto Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules, which are essential for antigen presentation to CD8+ T cells. This process is vital for the immune system to recognize and eliminate infected or malignant cells. TAP2 expression is found across various tissues with significance in immune-active sites.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
TAP2 is implicated in several immune-related pathways and conditions. One key pathway involving TAP2 is the antigen processing and presentation pathway, critical in immune surveillance and response. Dysfunction or variation in TAP2 can be linked to autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and potentially cancer, due to its role in presenting tumor antigens on cancer cells. Diseases associated with mutations in this gene include Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome, type I, where there is a deficiency in MHC class I expression, leading to severe immunodeficiency.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of TAP2 primarily relates to its influence on immune responses in the context of therapeutic interventions, particularly in cancer immunotherapy and vaccine response. For example, variations in TAP2 can affect the efficacy of treatments that rely on enhancing MHC class I mediated antigen presentation, which could be relevant for certain cancer vaccines and immunomodulatory drugs. Although specific drugs directly targeting TAP2 are currently not well established, understanding its genetic polymorphisms can help in devising personalized immunotherapy strategies, particularly in oncology, to optimize therapeutic outcomes.
