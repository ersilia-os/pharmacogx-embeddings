## Gene Summary
SLC22A5, also known as the solute carrier family 22 member 5, encodes a protein known as the organic cation transporter 2 (OCTN2). This protein is integral in the cellular uptake of carnitine, a molecule vital for the transport of fatty acids into mitochondria for energy production. The expression of SLC22A5 is widespread but is predominantly observed in the kidney, heart, muscle, and placenta. OCTN2 functions as a sodium-dependent carnitine transporter, and mutations in SLC22A5 are linked to systemic primary carnitine deficiency, a condition characterized by an inability to transport carnitine into cells, leading to various metabolic issues including muscle weakness and hypoglycemia.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
SLC22A5 is fundamentally associated with metabolic pathways, particularly those involving fatty acid metabolism. The primary disease connected with this gene is primary systemic carnitine deficiency (CDSP), an autosomal recessive disorder manifesting early in life with symptoms ranging from cardiomyopathy to muscle weakness, and even sudden infant death. The phenotypic consequences of SLC22A5 mutations are largely a result of disrupted energy production in cells reliant on fatty acids as a major energy source. Additionally, the gene is involved in metabolic response to certain dietary nutrients that require carnitine for their metabolism.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of SLC22A5 primarily involves its role in influencing the pharmacokinetics of various drugs and xenobiotics, albeit carnitine's transport mechanisms are chiefly of interest. While direct pharmacogenetic associations involving specific drugs might be limited, the transporter's general significance in drug absorption and disposition is well recognized. Key in this regard are its implicational studies for modulation of systemic levels of carnitine and, by extension, potentially influencing the action and side effects of drugs that are modulated by carnitine levels or metabolism. Research continues into how variants of SLC22A5 may affect response to drugs beyond those directly involving carnitine pathways, emphasizing its potential broader relevance in pharmacogenomics.
