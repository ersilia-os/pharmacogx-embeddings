## Gene Summary
CDA, or cytidine deaminase, is an enzyme predominantly involved in the metabolism of pyrimidine nucleosides in nucleotide salvage pathways, which are critical for DNA and RNA synthesis. This enzyme catalyzes the deamination of cytidine and deoxycytidine to uridine and deoxyuridine, respectively. CDA is expressed in various tissues with notable levels in the liver and blood cells. Its activity influences the effectiveness and toxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs, particularly nucleoside analogs.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CDA is directly associated with the metabolism of several chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment of cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma, and breast cancer. Disorders related to CDA include CDA deficiency, which can lead to increased drug toxicity and haematopoietic disorders. In terms of pathways, CDA is a key player in the pyrimidine metabolism pathway, specifically affecting nucleoside recycling. Genetic variations in CDA can affect drug efficacy and patient susceptibility to side effects of cytotoxic drugs.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of CDA plays a significant role in determining the clinical outcomes in patients undergoing treatment with nucleoside analogs like gemcitabine and cytarabine. Variants in the CDA gene can lead to differences in enzyme activity, thereby influencing drug concentration and toxicity. For instance, reduced activity alleles can result in higher plasma levels of active drug metabolites, increasing the risk of severe toxicities in patients treated with these drugs. Specific attention is given to allelic variants like CDA*2, which have been associated with an increased risk of severe toxic reactions to chemotherapeutic treatments. Overall, understanding individual genetic variability in CDA is crucial for optimizing dosages and minimizing adverse effects of nucleoside analogs in cancer therapy.
