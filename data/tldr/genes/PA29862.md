## Gene Summary
IMPDH1, or Inosine Monophosphate Dehydrogenase 1, is a gene encoding the enzyme IMP dehydrogenase 1 which plays a crucial role in the synthesis of purine nucleotides. IMPDH1 catalyzes the conversion of inosine monophosphate (IMP) to xanthosine monophosphate (XMP), a key step in the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides. This enzyme is essential for the proper growth and proliferation of cells, particularly in lymphocytes. IMPDH1 is differentially expressed in various tissues but is typically upregulated in rapidly dividing cells, including cancerous cells and activated immune cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The activity of IMPDH1 is targeted by several immunosuppressive and antiviral drugs. The gene's pivotal role in purine nucleotide synthesis makes it crucial in cellular proliferation and viability, which in turn implicates it in various clinical conditions. Pathway associations include the purine metabolism and the GMP biosynthesis via IMP dehydrogenase pathway. IMPDH1 has been linked to a number of diseases, most notably retinitis pigmentosa, an inherited degenerative eye disease that causes severe vision impairment and can lead to blindness. The gene has also been associated with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy and cancer, particularly in contexts where cell proliferation is dysregulated.

## Pharmacogenetics
From a pharmacogenetic perspective, IMPDH1 is of particular interest due to its implications in the efficacy and toxicity of certain drugs. Mycophenolate mofetil and ribavirin are two prime drugs that target the IMPDH enzyme as part of their therapeutic action. Mycophenolate mofetil, used as an immunosuppressive agent in organ transplantation, inhibits IMPDH1, leading to reduced proliferation of T-lymphocytes. Ribavirin, an antiviral drug used primarily for the treatment of Hepatitis C, also inhibits IMPDH1 which contributes to its antiviral efficacy by depletion of guanine nucleotides. Genetic variations in IMPDH1 can influence the response and adverse effects profile of these drugs, affecting treatment outcomes significantly. This gene's pharmacogenetics is especially relevant in the personalized treatment strategies in transplantation and viral infections.
