## Gene Summary
CACNB4 is the official symbol for the calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit beta 4. This gene is part of a family of beta subunits that coassemble with alpha-1 subunits to form voltage-dependent calcium channels, which are critical in translating electrical signals into intracellular calcium responses. CACNB4 specifically affects the properties and expression of the L-type calcium channels. It is widely expressed in different tissues including the brain and heart, among others, suggesting its broad role in calcium signaling impacting muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CACNB4 has been linked to several neurological disorders, most notably epilepsy, particularly Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME) and other types of idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Mutations in this gene can alter channel function, leading to various phenotypes of neurological dysfunction. This gene has been implicated in the regulation of neuronal excitability, cardiac function, and potentially in metabolic pathways influenced by calcium signaling. In terms of pathways, CACNB4 is primarily involved in the calcium signaling pathway, which is fundamental in various cellular processes including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, and gene expression regulations.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic studies of CACNB4 have primarily focused on its influence on the efficacy and safety of drugs used in the treatment of cardiovascular and neurological disorders. For instance, the gene's involvement in calcium channel function suggests it could modulate responses to calcium channel blockers, a class of drugs commonly used in hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias. While explicit pharmacogenetic data linking CACNB4 variations with differential drug response in clinical settings are limited, ongoing research may illuminate specific interactions and guide personalized medicine approaches in diseases like epilepsy and cardiac disorders. Reviewing responses to drugs like verapamil or diltiazem in the context of genetic variations in CACNB4 could be particularly insightful.
