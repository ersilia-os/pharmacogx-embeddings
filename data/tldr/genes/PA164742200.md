## Gene Summary
NTNG1, or Netrin G1, is a gene that encodes a member of the netrin family of proteins. Netrins are involved in axon guidance and are characterized by their function in the nervous system, particularly in directing neuronal development through attraction or repulsion cues. NTNG1 plays a critical role in the establishment of specific connections between neurons in the brain, impacting neural network formation and synaptic stability. This gene is predominantly expressed in the brain, including regions such as the hippocampus and frontal cortex, with roles potentially extending to neurodevelopment and cognitive functions.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
The NTNG1 gene has been implicated in several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, although the evidence is still emerging and further studies are required to fully establish these associations. Research suggests a potential link of NTNG1 with conditions like schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and intellectual disability, reflecting its crucial role in brain development and function. The gene's product, netrin G1, acts as a ligand for specific receptors that mediate its axonal guidance capabilities, influencing signaling pathways that are essential for neuronal patterning and the architecture of neural circuits.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, direct pharmacogenetic associations involving NTNG1 and specific drugs are limited and not well documented in the literature. The gene's primary influence remains within neurodevelopmental processes, and as such, its relevance to pharmacogenetics might be more related to understanding susceptibilities or responses in neurodevelopmental disorders rather than direct interactions with pharmaceutical agents. Future research may reveal more about how variations in NTNG1 could influence drug efficacy or the risk profiles for neurological conditions, potentially guiding more personalized therapeutic approaches.
