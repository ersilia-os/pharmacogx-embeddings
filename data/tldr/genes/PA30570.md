## Gene Summary
**MAN1A1** (Mannosidase Alpha Class 1A Member 1) gene encodes an enzyme belonging to the family of mannosidases. These enzymes are responsible for the hydrolysis of mannose during glycoprotein catabolism. The MAN1A1 protein, which is a type II membrane glycoprotein located in the Golgi apparatus, specifically catalyzes the removal of mannose residues from N-linked glycoproteins. This action is crucial in the processing of newly synthesized proteins, predominantly in glycoprotein maturation and quality control processes within cells. The expression of MAN1A1 is conserved across various tissues, but it is notably involved in physiological and pathological processes including cellular signaling and immune responses.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
MAN1A1 is primarily involved in the various biological pathways concerning protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum including carbohydrate metabolic processes. The dysfunction or altered expression of this gene has been implicated in a range of disorders. Specifically, deficiencies or malfunctions in mannosidase activity like the ones seen from mutations in MAN1A1 are linked with disorders in glycoprotein metabolism. While not directly linked with a specific well-known disease in many cases, disruptions in MAN1A1 can contribute indirectly to pathological processes in several diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders by affecting cellular communication and apoptosis.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the scope of pharmacogenetics, MAN1A1 has revealed lesser-known but emerging roles. Although direct associations with specific drugs remain under preliminary stages of research, the enzymatic activity of MAN1A1 suggests potential significance in the pharmacokinetics of therapies involving glycoproteins. For example, drugs that target or are composed of glycoproteins might have altered efficiency or degradation profiles depending on the expression and function of MAN1A1. Further research into MAN1A1 could elucidate new drug-gene interactions, particularly in treatments for diseases that involve glycoprotein dysfunction or abnormal glycosylation patterns. This could lead to personalized therapeutic strategies where MAN1A1â€™s activity is a determining factor in drug response and metabolism.
