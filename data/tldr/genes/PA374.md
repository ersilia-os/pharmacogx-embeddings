## Gene Summary
ABCB11, also known as the bile salt export pump (BSEP), is a gene that encodes a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. These transporters use ATP to transport various molecules across extra- and intracellular membranes. ABCB11 specifically mediates the transport of bile acids from the hepatocytes into the bile, playing a critical role in bile formation and bile acid metabolism in the liver. It is predominantly expressed in the liver and its proper function is essential for normal liver function.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in ABCB11 are associated with several liver-related diseases. This includes progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 (PFIC2), a severe liver disorder that progresses to liver failure in children. Other conditions include benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) and drug-induced liver injury (DILI), where ABCB11 dysfunction is implicated through reduced bile flow, leading to cholestasis and liver damage. The gene is also relevant in the context of cholestasis of pregnancy. In terms of pathways, ABCB11 is a key component in the bile acid secretion pathway, which is crucial for digestion and the elimination of cholesterol.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the field of pharmacogenetics, ABCB11 has been noted for its implications in drug response, particularly involving drugs that are processed through the liver. Genetic variations can affect the expression and function of the BSEP, influencing the pharmacokinetics of numerous medications. For example, reduced function of ABCB11 due to genetic variants can exacerbate the toxicity of drugs like rifampicin and potentially others metabolized in the liver. Moreover, patients with reduced ABCB11 activity may need adjustments in the dosage of drugs excreted into bile to avoid adverse effects. Understanding the pharmacogenetic context of ABCB11 can aid in refining treatment approaches for liver diseases and in managing drug therapies to minimize toxicity.
