## Gene Summary
IKBKB, also known as inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta, is a crucial enzyme in the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. The gene encodes a kinase that plays a vital role in mediating the immune response to infectious agents. IKBKB phosphorylates inhibitors of NF-kappaB, leading to their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, thereby allowing NF-kappaB transcription factors to enter the nucleus and activate gene expression. It is broadly expressed in human tissues, particularly in immune cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
IKBKB is associated with several pathways involving immune response regulation and inflammatory processes. Dysregulation of IKBKB has been linked to a variety of inflammatory disorders and some cancers, reflecting its crucial role in cell survival, cytokine production, and apoptosis. Diseases associated with IKBKB include a range of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, highlighting its involvement in aberrant immune responses. Moreover, because of its central role in NF-kappaB activation, IKBKB is a target for drug development aimed at modulating immune responses and inflammatory reactions.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the realm of pharmacogenetics, IKBKB plays a significant role in influencing the response to drugs that target the NF-kappaB pathway. For instance, specific IKBKB inhibitors are being investigated for their potential to treat conditions like psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and various cancers by modulating inflammation and cell survival pathways. The genetic variants of IKBKB can affect individual responses to these treatments, impacting drug efficacy and safety. Understanding these associations is crucial for personalized medicine approaches aiming to tailor treatments based on genetic profiles to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects.
