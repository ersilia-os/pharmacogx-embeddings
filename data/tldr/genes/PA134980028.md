## Gene Summary
ANKRD30B (Ankyrin Repeat Domain 30B) is a gene located on chromosome 5 of the human genome. It encodes a protein that belongs to the ankyrin repeat family, known for mediating protein-protein interactions and playing roles in various cellular processes such as growth, division, and signaling pathways. The specific function of ANKRD30B in humans remains less characterized compared to other ankyrin repeat-domain-containing proteins; however, it is assumed to be involved in regulatory processes within cells.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
According to available data, the specific drugs, diseases, and pathways directly involving ANKRD30B are not well-established. As it is a less studied gene, the broad implications of ANKRD30B in human disease conditions and pharmacological contexts are still under research. Hence, its direct association with any clinical phenotypes or specific biological pathways also remains relatively undocumented.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the field of pharmacogenetics, ANKRD30B does not currently have well-documented associations with drug effects, responses, or interactions. Its role or influence in the metabolism or efficacy of pharmacological agents has not been elucidated due to the limited understanding of this geneâ€™s function within the human body. As such, pharmacogenetic data pertaining to ANKRD30B is scarce, making it an area primed for future research endeavors to explore potential interactions and effects that could influence treatment and drug development approaches.
