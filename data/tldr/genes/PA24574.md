## Gene Summary
ADH5 (Alcohol Dehydrogenase 5) is a member of the alcohol dehydrogenase family, which are involved in the metabolism of alcohols and aldehydes. ADH5, specifically, is ubiquitously expressed and has a key role in metabolizing toxic aldehydes, including those formed from lipid peroxidation, and alcohol metabolism. Unlike other members of the alcohol dehydrogenase family, ADH5 exhibits low affinity for ethanol and primarily focuses on formaldehyde detoxification through the glutathione-dependent pathway, producing S-hydroxymethylglutathione.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ADH5 is critical in detoxifying agents that can lead to cellular damage and mutations. It has been less directly linked to specific diseases compared to other ADH enzymes, but its role in alcohol and aldehyde metabolism suggests potential implications in conditions related to oxidative stress and possibly certain types of cancer, although the direct connections are not well-defined. ADH5's involvement in the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous compounds positions it in several cellular protective pathways, notably those mitigating the effects of oxidative stress.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics associated with ADH5 are primarily focused on its metabolism of formaldehyde, a common industrial chemical and environmental pollutant, as well as a metabolic byproduct. While ADH5 is not directly targeted by specific drugs, its activity can influence the toxicity and effectiveness of drugs and other chemicals that are metabolized via the same or related pathways. For instance, individuals with variations in ADH5 may exhibit differences in sensitivity to formaldehyde exposure and possibly to drugs that yield formaldehyde as a byproduct. Thus, while ADH5's direct pharmacogenetic impact may be limited, its role in chemical metabolism can indirectly affect drug toxicity and efficacy in broader therapeutic contexts.
