## Gene Summary
NUP107, shorthand for Nucleoporin 107, is a crucial component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in eukaryotic cells. The NPC facilitates the transport of molecules across the nuclear envelope, separating the nucleus from the cytoplasm. NUP107, as part of the Nup107-160 subcomplex, plays a significant role in the assembly and structural integrity of the NPC. This gene is ubiquitously expressed across different tissues, demonstrating its fundamental role in cell biology, particularly in processes of nucleocytoplasmic transport.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
NUP107 is implicated in several cellular pathways, predominately revolving around its role in nucleocytoplasmic transport and mitotic spindle assembly during cell division. Mutations in the NUP107 gene can lead to defects in these processes and have been associated with a range of cellular dysfunctions. Although directly linked diseases are not extensively cataloged, research suggests potential connections to cancer biology due to its pivotal role in cell cycle regulation and mitosis. The geneâ€™s essential function in the NPC attributes broadly to cellular phenomena such as signaling cascade modulation and gene expression regulation.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic implications of NUP107 are not as well-defined compared to genes directly involved with drug metabolism or drug targets. However, given its fundamental role in NPC function and cellular transport mechanisms, variations in NUP107 could hypothetically influence the efficacy and toxicity of drugs that rely on nucleocytoplasmic transport for their mechanism of action. While specific drugs associated directly with variations in NUP107 have yet to be identified, studying its genetic variations could be vital in understanding individual differences in response to treatments that are affected by nuclear transport processes. Thus, the gene remains a prospective target for pharmacogenetic research, potentially influencing treatment outcomes in diseases related to disrupted nuclear transport.
