## Gene Summary
ATIC, also known as AICAR Transformylase/IMP Cyclohydrolase, encodes a bifunctional enzyme that plays a crucial role in the purine biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme catalyzes the last two steps of de novo purine biosynthesis, including the transformation of AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide) to FAICAR (formyl-AICAR) and subsequently to IMP (inosine monophosphate). This gene is expressed ubiquitously in various tissues with significant implications for nucleotide metabolism and cell proliferation. Deficiencies or dysregulations in ATIC's activity can impact cellular growth and viability, given its central role in purine metabolism.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ATIC is critical in the purine synthesis pathway, which is essential for DNA and RNA production. Its involvement in purine metabolism means it is indirectly linked to numerous cellular processes including DNA replication and repair. Diseases associated with ATIC include AICA-ribosiduria, a rare inborn error of metabolism characterized by excess amounts of AICA-riboside in urine and various neurological symptoms. The pathways associated with ATIC include not only purine biosynthesis but also metabolic pathways that intersect with cell growth, development, and response to cellular stress. The enzyme's role in these fundamental processes suggests that its proper functioning is critical for normal cellular and physiological development.

## Pharmacogenetics
From a pharmacogenetic perspective, ATIC is noteworthy in its interaction with drugs like methotrexate (MTX) and azathioprine, which are used to treat various forms of cancer and autoimmune diseases, respectively. Methotrexate functions as a folate antagonist and inhibits several enzymes involved in purine synthesis, including ATIC. As such, genetic variations in ATIC can influence MTX efficacy and toxicity. For instance, certain polymorphisms in the ATIC gene are associated with increased risk of adverse effects from MTX in patients with conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and leukemia. Variants in ATIC could lead to altered enzyme efficiency and therefore affect the intracellular balance of purine derivatives, this might alter the therapeutic response or toxicity profile in individuals treated with these drugs. Understanding these pharmacogenetic associations can be key in optimizing therapeutic strategies and personalizing treatments based on genetic makeup.
