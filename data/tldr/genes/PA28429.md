## Gene Summary
FUT2, or "fucosyltransferase 2," is a gene that encodes an enzyme involved in the synthesis of the H antigen. The H antigen is a precursor to the ABO blood group antigens, and variations in this gene can influence susceptibility to infections and chronic diseases. Predominantly expressed in the mucosa of respiratory and digestive tracts, FUT2 mediates the expression of ABH antigens on mucosal surfaces and within bodily secretions. The enzyme it encodes adds fucose in an alpha(1,2) linkage to terminal galactose residues of glycoproteins and glycolipids. The activity of FUT2 significantly impacts the composition of the gut microbiota and has been linked to various immune-related outcomes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Variants in FUT2 are associated with the "non-secretor" phenotype, where individuals do not express ABH antigens in their secretions, influencing susceptibility to many infectious diseases. Diseases linked with FUT2 genetic variants include Norovirus infection, bacterial vaginosis, and Crohnâ€™s disease. Additionally, alteration in the gut microbiome due to FUT2 activity has implications for conditions like diabetes and asthma. The gene participates in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis - lacto and neolacto series, indicating roles in biological membraning and signaling, affecting immune responses and microbial interactions. 

## Pharmacogenetics
FUT2's pharmacogenetic relevance primarily connects to its impact on the microbiome, which can influence the metabolism and effectiveness of certain drugs, though direct drug associations are not widely characterized. For instance, drug absorption and response can be indirectly affected in individuals with FUT2 variants due to differences in gut flora composition, which can alter the activation or degradation of orally administered drugs. Exploring FUT2 polymorphisms might contribute to understanding variations in treatment outcomes for gastrointestinal and immune-related diseases, potentially paving the way for more personalized therapeutic approaches. However, more direct associations between FUT2 genotypes and specific drug responses require further investigation to be thoroughly defined.
