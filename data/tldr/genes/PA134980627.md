## Gene Summary
POMT2 (Protein O-Mannosyltransferase 2) is a gene that encodes an enzyme involved in the glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, an important protein in skeletal muscle and neuronal tissues. POMT2, in conjunction with POMT1, catalyzes the first step of O-mannosyl glycan synthesis, which is crucial for the proper functioning of dystroglycan. Proper glycosylation of dystroglycan impacts cell integrity and signaling, with major roles in processes such as cell migration and structure stabilization. POMT2 expression is widespread but particularly significant in the brain and muscle tissues, reflecting its involvement in neurological and muscular systems.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Mutations in POMT2 are linked to a spectrum of genetic disorders known collectively as dystroglycanopathies. These include conditions like Walker-Warburg Syndrome, Muscle-Eye-Brain disease, and Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy. These disorders are characterized by a combination of muscular dystrophy, brain abnormalities, and ocular defects. These phenotypes result from impaired glycosylation of dystroglycan, which disrupts its ability to function as a cell adhesion molecule. The pathway involving POMT2 chiefly revolves around protein modification and cell membrane stability, integrating with larger pathways of muscular and neurological development and maintenance.

## Pharmacogenetics
As of current knowledge, the pharmacogenetics of POMT2 is not directly associated with specific drug responses or treatments largely because its primary implications are in congenital, structural disorders of the muscle and brain rather than conditions typically managed with pharmacology. Research into therapies has been more focused on gene therapy and other biological approaches to correct the underlying defect in glycosylation. However, it remains crucial for personalized medicine efforts in genomic diagnostics and potential future interventions that might target the biochemical pathways influenced by POMT2.
