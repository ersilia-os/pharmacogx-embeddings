## Gene Summary
ARHGAP28, short for Rho GTPase Activating Protein 28, is a gene involved in the regulation of the Rho family of GTPases. These GTPases play a crucial role in various cellular processes including actin cytoskeleton organization, cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. ARHGAP28 functions primarily by promoting the GTPase activity of Rho proteins, which leads to their inactivation. The gene exhibits a broad expression pattern in human tissues, including significant levels in heart and skeletal muscle, which suggests its importance in the normal function of these tissues.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Research around ARHGAP28 primarily focuses on its role in cell structure and signaling pathways. The gene participates in pathways such as regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cell motility. Perturbations in these pathways can potentially contribute to pathophysiological conditions, including cardiovascular abnormalities and cancers. Although direct associations with specific diseases are still under exploration, understanding ARHGAP28â€™s function in Rho GTPase signaling could illuminate its roles in these broader disease processes.

## Pharmacogenetics
As of the present knowledge base, specific pharmacogenetic associations between ARHGAP28 and therapeutic drugs have not been well-established. The gene's role in modulating the activity of Rho GTPases implicates it in pathways that could potentially influence drug responses, particularly in treatments targeting cancer and cardiovascular diseases. However, detailed studies directly linking ARHGAP28 gene variants to variations in drug efficacy or safety are yet to be conducted. Future research in pharmacogenetics may reveal significant interactions worth targeting for therapeutic manipulation or personalized medicine approaches.
