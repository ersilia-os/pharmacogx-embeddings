## Gene Summary
UGT2B17 (UDP Glucuronosyltransferase Family 2 Member B17) is a gene encoding an enzyme critical in the glucuronidation process, whereby glucuronic acid is added to small lipophilic molecules, such as steroids, bilirubin, hormones, and drugs, making them more water-soluble. UGT2B17 is predominantly expressed in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in other tissues like the prostate and skin. This enzyme plays an essential role in the metabolism of endogenous substrates, including sex steroids such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
UGT2B17 is involved in the detoxification pathway of numerous drugs and endogenous compounds by catalyzing their glucuronidation. Alterations in UGT2B17 expression and activity are linked to variability in the metabolism of therapeutic agents, influencing their efficacy and toxicity. Also, polymorphisms in this gene have been associated with different phenotypes in drug metabolism and disease susceptibilities, such as hormone-dependent cancers. The enzyme is a part of the steroid hormone metabolism pathway, influencing physiological and pathological processes.

## Pharmacogenetics
UGT2B17's role in pharmacogenetics is significant due to its influence on the metabolism of various drugs, thereby affecting their plasma concentrations and clinical outcomes. Polymorphic variations, including deletions, in the UGT2B17 gene can lead to differences in enzyme expression levels and activity. This variation notably impacts the metabolism and therapeutic effects of drugs like serms (tamoxifen), HIV antivirals, and cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Moreover, genetic variants of UGT2B17 are implicated in the altered glucuronidation and disposition of certain opioids, NSAIDs, and hormone therapies, potentially modifying therapy response and adverse effect profiles. Thus, genetic testing for UGT2B17 variations can be crucial in personalizing drug doses to optimize efficacy and minimize toxicity.
