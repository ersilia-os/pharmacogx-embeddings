## Gene Summary
ACP5 encodes the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase type 5 protein, which is primarily expressed in osteoclasts and macrophages. It is an iron-containing enzyme crucial in bone resorption and meets the high demand for acid production in the lysosomes of osteoclasts to dissolve bone minerals. The protein plays a significant role in the metabolism of bone and the regulation of osteoclast and macrophage function. Its expression is particularly important in conditions affecting bone density and turnover.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ACP5 mutations have been associated with diseases such as spondyloenchondrodysplasia and osteopetrosis autosomal recessive 2, with affected individuals often presenting issues related to bone remodeling. The enzyme is involved in various pathways including bone resorption as well as phosphorus metabolic processes. In disease states, aberrant activity or levels of ACP5 have been linked to altered bone density and defective bone turnover, which can impact overall skeletal stability and function.

## Pharmacogenetics
While there is limited direct pharmacogenetic data involving ACP5, its role in bone metabolism suggests implications in regards to drugs affecting bone density and turnover, such as bisphosphonates and other osteoporosis treatments. Understanding individual variations in the ACP5 gene could potentially guide the therapeutic use of these drugs. Further research is needed to establish clear pharmacogenetic associations and the potential impact of gene variants on drug response in osteoclast-related pathologies.
