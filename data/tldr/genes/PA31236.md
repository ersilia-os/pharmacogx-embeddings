## Gene Summary
MTHFD1, or methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NADP+ dependent) 1, encodes a protein that participates in the folate metabolism pathway. It is primarily expressed in the liver and has roles in nucleotide biosynthesis and the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. The enzyme produced by MTHFD1 has three distinct activities: it functions as a dehydrogenase, a cyclohydrolase, and a synthetase. This multi-functionality allows it to interconvert between different forms of folate, which is crucial for DNA synthesis and repair.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
MTHFD1 is involved in several critical metabolic pathways, including one-carbon metabolism and purine and pyrimidine synthesis, all of which are essential for DNA and RNA production. Mutations and polymorphisms in this gene have been associated with diverse health issues such as neural tube defects, cardiovascular disease, and cancer susceptibility. The gene's role in folate metabolism also ties it to phenotypes involving altered folate levels, which can have broad implications for developmental and chronic conditions.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of MTHFD1 predominantly relates to its influence on drug efficacy and safety in treatments involving folate metabolism. For instance, variations in the MTHFD1 gene can affect responses to methotrexate, a drug used commonly in cancer therapy and autoimmune diseases. The gene's polymorphisms may alter methotrexate toxicity and efficacy, suggesting a potential role in personalized dosing strategies. Furthermore, understanding variations in this gene can be crucial in optimizing folate supplementation in pregnant women to prevent neural tube defects effectively.
