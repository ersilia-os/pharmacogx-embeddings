## Gene Summary
WNK1 (WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 1) is a serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in the regulation of electrolyte homeostasis, vascular tone, and renal sodium excretion. The protein encoded by WNK1 affects ion channels and transporters, influencing the balance of potassium, sodium, and chloride ions in cells, which is crucial for blood pressure control and osmoregulation. WNK1 is broadly expressed in the kidney, heart, lung, and skeletal muscle. Genetic variation and expression levels of WNK1 influence blood pressure regulation and have implications in hypertension and electrolyte imbalance.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
WNK1 has been linked to several diseases, most notably hypertension, particularly familial hyperkalemic hypertension (FHHt) or pseudohypoaldosteronism type II. This condition is characterized by high blood pressure, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis. WNK1 impacts various signaling pathways, including those involved in osmotic stress, volume regulation, and vascular tone. The gene operates in pathways influencing the activity of sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporters (NKCCs) and sodium-chloride symporters (NCC), which are essential for maintaining ion balance in the kidney.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic research on WNK1 primarily focuses on its impact on hypertension and the response to antihypertensive drugs. Variations in the WNK1 gene can alter the therapeutic effects of diuretics, which are commonly used to manage blood pressure and fluid balance. Diuretics like thiazides target pathways influenced by WNK1, specifically by inhibiting the NCC transporters in the kidney distal tubules. Genetic variations that enhance the activity of WNK1 can lead to resistance to thiazide diuretics, thereby necessitating adjustments in medication type or dosage for effective treatment. Thus, understanding individual genetic variations in WNK1 contributes to more personalized and effective therapeutic strategies in the management of hypertension and related disorders.
