## Gene Summary
WRAP53 (WD Repeat Containing Antisense to TP53), also known as WDR79, is a gene encoding a protein involved in various cellular processes, including RNA processing and telomere maintenance. The WRAP53 protein plays a critical role in directing the small Cajal body-specific RNA (scaRNA) to the Cajal bodies, a function essential for the modification and maturation of small nuclear RNAs (snRNA). It interacts with telomerase and is involved in telomere elongation. The gene is located antisense to the tumor suppressor gene TP53, indicating potential regulatory interactions.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
WRAP53 is linked to several crucial cellular pathways, particularly those associated with DNA repair and telomere maintenance. Dysregulation of WRAP53 is predominantly associated with cancer. There are implications that mutations or altered expressions of WRAP53 are related to the development of carcinomas, including head, neck, and ovarian cancers. In cellular models, WRAP53 has shown to be critical for the assembly of the telomerase complex, impacting cellular aging and oncogenesis. Its role in DNA damage response pathways underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of WRAP53 primarily involves its implications in cancer risk and treatment responses due to its regulatory role on TP53 and its involvement in telomere maintenance. Although direct associations with specific drugs are not extensively documented in the literature, the gene's influence on TP53 and DNA repair mechanisms indirectly suggests that variations in WRAP53 could influence the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents, especially those that target DNA integrity and cancer cell proliferation. Future pharmacogenetic research could further elucidate the potential of WRAP53 as a biomarker for cancer therapy personalization, particularly in therapies targeting telomerase and DNA repair pathways.
