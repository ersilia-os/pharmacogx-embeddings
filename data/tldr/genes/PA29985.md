## Gene Summary
IVL, or Involucrin, is a gene that plays an essential role in the formation of the cornified cell envelope, a structure critical to the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes and for the barrier function of the skin. The IVL gene is expressed predominantly in the epidermis and other squamous epithelia. The involucrin protein itself is one of the earliest precursors in the envelope assembly process. It is cross-linked by transglutaminases during the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, creating a highly resistant and insoluble structure.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
Involucrin is involved in the biological process primarily related to the development and maintenance of skin barrier function and is crucial in the skin's defense mechanism against environmental hazards. Mutations or altered expression of IVL has been associated with skin pathologies, although direct connections with specific diseases are not extensively documented, it implicates potential roles in skin hyperproliferative disorders and abnormal keratinization processes. IVL expression levels are also investigated in conditions like psoriasis and atopic dermatitis for their diagnostic implications. In terms of pathways, IVL plays a role in epithelial differentiation and is part of the keratinocyte differentiation pathway.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the field of pharmacogenetics, IVL has not been a primary focus like genes directly involved in drug metabolism or drug transport. However, understanding IVL expression could be relevant in the context of treatment strategies for skin-related conditions, particularly where barrier function or cell differentiation is targeted. While specific drugs targeting IVL are not currently highlighted in pharmacogenetic resources, compounds affecting keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, such as retinoids or corticosteroids, might indirectly impact IVL expression and function. Research into IVL's role in pharmacogenetics remains an area for potential future exploration, especially in developing therapies for dermatological conditions.
