## Gene Summary
CDH2 (Cadherin 2), also known as N-cadherin (neural cadherin), is a gene that encodes a type of protein called cadherin. These proteins are responsible for calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion and play crucial roles in the organization of cells into structures. CDH2 is prominently expressed in the nervous system, heart, and other tissues where it is vital for processes such as synaptic plasticity and cardiac muscle development. As a member of the classic cadherin family, it is integral in maintaining proper cell architecture and function in various tissue types.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
CDH2 is involved in several key biological pathways, including cellular signaling pathways governing cell adhesion, migration, and tissue organization. Alterations in CDH2 expression or function have been associated with a range of diseases, including heart defects, cancer (particularly tumor metastasis in breast and prostate cancer), and, potentially, neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease. The role of CDH2 in these conditions often relates to its function in cell-cell adhesion and mobility, influencing tumor invasiveness and the integrity of neuronal connections.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the field of pharmacogenetics, CDH2 has not been as prominently featured as some other genes, partly due to its primary functions in structural cell processes rather than direct involvement in drug metabolism or drug targets. However, understanding variations in CDH2 could be relevant in a personalized medicine context, particularly for cancer treatments where therapies might aim to inhibit cell adhesion or mobility as a strategy to limit tumor metastasis and progression. Drugs influencing CDH2-mediated pathways could potentially be affected by genetic variations in CDH2 expression or function, although specific drug-gene interactions have not been extensively documented to date. As research continues, more light may be shed on the implications of CDH2 in the pharmacogenomic landscape, particularly concerning cancer therapeutics.
