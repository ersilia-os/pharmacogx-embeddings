## Gene Summary
IL11, or Interleukin 11, is a multifunctional cytokine produced by stromal cells, such as fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and osteoblasts. It is an essential cytokine involved in hematopoiesis, embryogenesis, and inflammation. IL11 also plays significant roles in bone metabolism, mucosal protection, and wound healing. The gene is expressed not only in a variety of organs but particularly in mesenchymal cells, and it carries out its functions chiefly through the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
IL11 is therapeutically involved in treating conditions like chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia and bone marrow recovery after chemotherapy, owing to its ability to stimulate platelet production. In the context of disease, aberrations in the expression or function of IL11 are linked to inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), as well as fibrosis of various organs. The gene affects pathways such as the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and has notable interactions within cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathways that modulate inflammatory responses and cellular proliferation.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of IL11 revolve mainly around its recombinant form used as a therapeutic agent, known as oprelvekin (tradename Neumega). Oprelvekin is used for preventing severe thrombocytopenia and reducing the need for platelet transfusions following myelosuppressive chemotherapy in certain cancer patients. Variability in therapeutic response and adverse effects such as fluid retention, pulmonary edema, and cardiac arrhythmias might be influenced by genetic differences in the IL11 receptor or signaling components downstream of it, such as variations in the STAT3 gene. Understanding these associations can aid in tailoring effective treatment strategies and managing side effects effectively in different patients.
