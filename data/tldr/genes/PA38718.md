## Gene Summary
PIGM (Phosphatidylinositol Glycan Anchor Biosynthesis Class M) is a gene involved in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. These anchors attach many proteins to the cell surface, serving essential roles in cell signaling, cell interaction, and dynamics. PIGM catalyzes the transfer of mannose, a type of sugar, to the growing GPI anchor in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, indicating its fundamental role in cellular processes.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
PIGM's function in GPI anchor biosynthesis links it to multiple cellular pathways primarily concerning membrane dynamics and protein localization. Mutations in this gene have been associated with developmental disorders and a predisposition to certain infections, underscoring the GPI anchor's role in immune response and intercellular communication. In diseases, there is evidence linking PIGM to intellectual disability and epilepsy, particularly when mannose transfer in GPI biosynthesis is impaired. This impairment can lead to abnormal cell surface expressions of proteins essential for neural connectivity and function.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of PIGM is an emerging field; although specific drug interactions have not been extensively documented, the gene's role in GPI anchor formation calls attention to its potential influence on drug efficacy and safety in treatments targeting cell surface proteins. Understanding genetic variations in the PIGM gene could eventually guide the use of certain medications, particularly those whose action depends on the presence or absence of specific membrane-bound proteins. Future pharmacogenomic studies will need to explore how PIGM mutations affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of such drugs, potentially impacting personalized medicine strategies.
