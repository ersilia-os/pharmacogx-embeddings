## Gene Summary
ORM2, short for "orosomucoid 2," is a gene encoding the alpha-2-glycoprotein, an acute phase reactant primarily synthesized in the liver. ORM2 is part of the lipocalin family and plays a significant role in modulating the immune system's response to systemic inflammation. It acts by binding various ligands such as hormones and drugs, thus influencing their distribution and availability. The expression of ORM2 is upregulated during acute inflammatory processes, and it is sensitive to interleukin-6 levels.

## Gene Drugs, Diseases, Phenotypes, and Pathways
ORM2 is associated with various inflammatory and metabolic conditions. It is particularly relevant in diseases characterized by an acute phase response, including infections, inflammatory diseases, and some cancers. The protein encoded by the ORM2 gene has been implicated in modulating the immune response, inflammation, and possibly in the transport and metabolism of specific drugs. Research has suggested a role for ORM2 in processes such as immune system regulation, lipid transport and metabolism, and inflammatory response. Given its role in binding small molecules, it potentially affects many pathways involving hormone and drug interactions.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, ORM2 has not been as extensively studied as some other genes, but its role in disease states suggests it could influence drug efficacy and safety indirectly through its role in inflammation and acute phase reactions. ORM2 can bind and modulate the availability of certain anti-inflammatory drugs, potentially affecting their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. While not directly linked to specific drugs in pharmacogenetic studies, understanding variations in the ORM2 gene could eventually help clarify inter-individual differences in responses to medications in inflammatory conditions. This knowledge may lead to more personalized approaches in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, though specific actionable pharmacogenetic interactions have yet to be fully established.
