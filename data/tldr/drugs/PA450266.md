## Drug Summary
Loratadine, marketed under various names such as Aerotina, Alavert, and Claritin, is a second-generation antihistamine primarily used to manage symptoms of allergic rhinitis and urticaria. Unlike first-generation antihistamines, Loratadine is preferred for its minimal sedative effects and low CNS penetration, which reduces risks of drowsiness or cognitive impairment. It selectively targets peripheral H1 receptors, inhibiting the action of histamine, a key player in allergic reactions. Loratadine is rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations of its active metabolite (descarboethoxyloratadine) generally occurring within 1-4 hours post-administration. Loratadine undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 in the liver.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Loratadine exerts its antihistamine effects by acting as an inverse agonist at the H1 histamine receptors (HRH1), stabilizing them in an inactive state. This action reduces the typical symptoms triggered by histamine in allergic conditions. Additionally, Loratadine has been shown to affect the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2 (KCNH2), although the clinical relevance of this interaction is not fully understood. The drug is metabolized predominantly by hepatic enzymes including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A1, and less significantly by CYP2C19, CYP2C8, and others. Loratadine and its metabolites interact with transporters like P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1) and bile salt export pump (ABCB11), which can influence its distribution and excretion.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacokinetics and effects of Loratadine can be significantly influenced by genetic variants, particularly in the metabolizing enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Polymorphisms in CYP3A4 can alter the rate of Loratadine metabolism, affecting drug levels and potentially its efficacy and safety. More notably, CYP2D6, which is highly polymorphic with multiple alleles that can result in poor, intermediate, extensive, or ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes, plays a critical role. Patients with poor metabolizer status may experience increased plasma levels of Loratadine, leading to an enhanced risk of adverse effects, whereas ultrarapid metabolizers might require higher doses to achieve efficacy. Thus, genotyping can be beneficial in optimizing Loratadine therapy for allergic conditions, ensuring both efficacy and safety in individuals with significant genetic variability in drug-metabolizing enzymes.
