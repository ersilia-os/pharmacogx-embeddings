## Drug Summary
Desipramine, also known by its brand names Pertofran and Pertofrane, is a secondary amine tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) primarily used in the treatment of various depressive syndromes, notably endogenous depression. It may also be employed off-label for managing neuropathic pain, anxiety disorders like panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). As an active metabolite of imipramine, desipramine inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine more potently than serotonin, enhancing noradrenergic neurotransmission. Additionally, it exhibits less anticholinergic and sedative effects compared to other tertiary amine TCAs. Desipramine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with a peak plasma concentration reaching 4-6 hours post-administration, but it undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism mainly in the liver.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Desipramine acts primarily by inhibiting the sodium-dependent noradrenaline transporter (SLC6A2) and to a lesser extent, the sodium-dependent serotonin transporter (SLC6A4), increasing the synaptic concentrations of these neurotransmitters. It also interacts with various adrenergic, serotonergic, and muscarinic receptors (e.g., HTR2A, CHRM1-5, ADRB1/2), which contribute to its pharmacodynamic effects and side effects. Regarding its metabolism, desipramine is predominantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, notably CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent CYP1A2. It is also a substrate of several transporters including P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and various solute carriers (e.g., SLC22A1-5). ORM1 is identified as a carrier associated with desipramine.

## Pharmacogenetics
Desipramine's metabolism is significantly influenced by genetic polymorphisms, particularly in the CYP2D6 gene. Variants such as rs3892097, rs35742686, rs1135824, rs5030655, and rs28371733 in CYP2D6 can lead to reduced or poor metabolism of the drug, which might necessitate dose adjustments to mitigate potential toxicity or therapeutic inefficacy. These polymorphisms have been associated with an altered enzymatic activity that can affect the plasma levels of desipramine, thus impacting both its efficacy and side effect profile. Genetic testing for CYP2D6 polymorphisms can be beneficial in optimizing desipramine therapy, ensuring therapeutic effectiveness while minimizing adverse reactions.
