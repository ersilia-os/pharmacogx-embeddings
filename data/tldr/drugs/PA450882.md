## Drug Summary
Perphenazine, marketed under various brand names like Decentan, Emesinal, Fentazin, Perphenan, Trilafon, and Trilifan, is a potent antipsychotic belonging to the phenothiazine class. It is primarily used for managing symptoms associated with psychotic disorders and for controlling severe nausea and vomiting in adults. Perphenazine functions as a dopamine D1 and D2 receptor antagonist; it exhibits greater behavioral potency than many other phenothiazines and is known to be about 10 to 15 times as potent as chlorpromazine, another drug in the same class. The pharmacokinetics of perphenazine shows an absolute bioavailability of 40% following oral administration with hepatic metabolism primarily engaging extensive first-pass metabolism.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Perphenazine's mechanism of action involves binding primarily to the dopamine D1 and D2 receptors (DRD1 and DRD2), thereby inhibiting their activity which contributes to its antipsychotic effects. It also affects calmodulin (CALM1) and has additional binding to the alpha-adrenergic receptor, further implicating its role in neurotransmission modulation. The drug is metabolized in the liver, predominantly involving several cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2C18, CYP2C19, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. This wide range of enzymes involved suggests a complex interaction with various substrates and potential for drug-drug interactions. Additionally, it is a carrier for serum albumin (ALB), which may influence its distribution within the body.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, perphenazine metabolism predominantly involves CYP2D6, an enzyme known for its genetic polymorphisms that can significantly affect drug metabolism rates among individuals. Variants in the CYP2D6 gene can categorize individuals as poor, intermediate, extensive, or ultrarapid metabolizers, which can influence both the efficacy and toxicity of perphenazine. For instance, poor metabolizers may experience enhanced drug effects and side effects, necessitating dosage adjustments. Additionally, its interaction with multiple other CYP enzymes suggests potential variability in drug levels based on individual genetic makeup, which can affect both therapeutic outcomes and the risk of adverse effects. Although detailed genomic data specific to perphenazine are not provided, these interactions indicate significant considerations for personalized medicine approaches.
