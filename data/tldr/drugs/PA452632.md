## Drug Summary
Acenocoumarol, also known under brand names such as Ascumar and Mini-sintrom, is a coumarin derivative used primarily as an oral anticoagulant. As a Vitamin K antagonist, it inhibits vitamin K reductase, thus preventing the reduction of vitamin K and interfering with the carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, and X), critical for blood clot formation. This alteration affects both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of blood coagulation. Acenocoumarol is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with peak plasma levels reached within 1 to 3 hours and a bioavailability greater than 60%. It undergoes extensive liver metabolism primarily via CYP450 enzymes, leading to several inactive metabolites. It is indicated for the prevention and treatment of various thromboembolic disorders, including deep vein thrombosis and myocardial infarction.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary target of Acenocoumarol is the Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1), which is crucial in the vitamin K cycle that activates the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors crucial for coagulation. The drug's metabolism is predominantly facilitated by several cytochrome P450 enzymes, notably CYP2C9, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These enzymes are responsible for its oxidative metabolism and subsequent breakdown. Additionally, the transporter protein P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1) and carrier proteins such as serum albumin (ALB) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1) are involved in its transport and distribution within the body. These proteins play roles in the drugâ€™s pharmacokinetics by affecting its absorption, distribution, and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
Acenocoumarol pharmacogenetics is significantly influenced by variations in genes like CYP2C9 and VKORC1, which impact its metabolism and efficacy. Polymorphisms in CYP2C9 (particularly rs1799853 and rs1057910) are associated with reduced metabolism of Acenocoumarol, leading to higher plasma levels of the drug, which can increase the risk of bleeding. Patients carrying these polymorphisms may require dose adjustments to mitigate the risk of adverse effects such as hemorrhage or thrombosis. Furthermore, the VKORC1 genotype, specifically rs9934438, influences the enzyme's sensitivity to inhibition by Acenocoumarol. Carriers of this polymorphism have a reduced metabolism rate and an increased susceptibility to drug-related bleeding. Genetic testing may inform more personalized and safer dosing strategies, potentially reducing the incidence of adverse effects in treated individuals.
