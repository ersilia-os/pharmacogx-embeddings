## Drug Summary
Aripiprazole, known under brand names such as Abilitat, is an atypical antipsychotic drug primarily used for treating conditions like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder as an adjunct therapy, irritability associated with autism spectrum disorder, and Tourette's syndrome. The FDA approved Aripiprazole on November 15, 2002. Its mechanism of action involves partial agonist activity at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors, and antagonist activity at 5-HT2A receptors. It behaves uniquely among antipsychotics at dopamine receptors where it can either upregulate or downregulate dopamine synthesis depending on the dopamine concentration. Aripiprazole has good oral bioavailability, and its absorption characteristics differ based on the formulation (tablet vs. solution vs. extended-release injection). It is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, with its major active metabolite being dehydro-aripiprazole.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Aripiprazole exhibits high affinity for several neurotransmitter receptors including dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and various others across the adrenergic, histamine, and muscarinic families. Notably, its antipsychotic effects are mainly attributed to its actions on D2 and 5-HT2A receptors. Metabolism of Aripiprazole predominantly involves the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Additionally, transporters like ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) and ABCG2 play roles in its pharmacokinetics, influencing the drug's absorption and distribution. The drug also interacts with serum albumin (ALB) which could affect its pharmacokinetics by influencing its distribution and plasma protein binding.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, Aripiprazoleâ€™s metabolism shows significant variability based on CYP2D6 polymorphism. Individuals with poor metabolizer phenotypes of the CYP2D6 enzyme have altered pharmacokinetics, leading to recommendations for dose adjustments. As these individuals have reduced enzymatic activity, they are potentially at risk for higher plasma concentrations and ensuing side effects; thus, they are advised to take a lower dosage of Aripiprazole. Genetic variations in other enzymes like CYP3A4 and transport proteins such as ABCB1 could also influence individual responses to the drug, although specific guidelines for adjustments based on these genes are less clearly defined. Ongoing research and clinical studies continue to elucidate more about these pharmacogenetic interactions to improve personalized treatment approaches with Aripiprazole.
