## Drug Summary
Piperaquine is an antimalarial agent, first synthesized in the 1960s and predominantly used in China. It saw a decrease in usage during the 1980s due to the emergence of piperaquine-resistant strains of *Plasmodium falciparum* and the advent of artemisinin derivatives. However, piperaquine has resurfaced in the therapeutic landscape as part of the combination product Eurartesim, along with the artemisinin derivative dihydroartemisinin (DB11638), authorized for market use by the European Medicines Agency in October 2011. This combination is primarily indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated *P. falciparum* infection in adults and children. Piperaquine acts by inhibiting the haem detoxification pathway of the *P. falciparum* parasite. It exhibits complex pharmacokinetics with enterohepatic recycling and shows substantial systemic absorption facilitated by food intake. The drug accumulates more significantly in females and is highly concentrated in red blood cells.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
While specific protein targets of piperaquine are not detailed, its primary action is an inhibition of the haem detoxification pathway in the malaria parasite, similar in mechanism to chloroquine. Pharmacokinetic processes are influenced by its metabolism mainly through cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, including CYP3A4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, and CYP2E1. These enzymes are responsible for the oxidative metabolic pathways that Piperaquine undergoes, mainly resulting in metabolites formed through N-dealkylation, hydroxylation, and N-oxidation, impacting both the drug's efficacy and safety profile. There are no specific carriers or transporters implicated in the DrugBank Entry.

## Pharmacogenetics
The impact of genetic variation on the metabolism of piperaquine can be significant, given its metabolism through multiple CYP enzymes. Variants in genes encoding these enzymes, such as CYP3A4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, and CYP2E1, could potentially influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of piperaquine. For instance, genetic polymorphisms affecting CYP2C19, which is known for its genetic variability contributing to inter-individual differences in drug metabolism, could alter piperaquine plasma levels and thus its efficacy and toxicity. However, specific pharmacogenetic data linking these genetic variations to clinical outcomes with piperaquine treatment are not extensively documented, which could be an area for future clinical pharmacogenetics research.
