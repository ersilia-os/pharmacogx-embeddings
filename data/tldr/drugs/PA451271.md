## Drug Summary
Ropivacaine is an aminoamide local anesthetic primarily used for regional or local anesthesia in adult patients during surgery or for acute pain management. Marketed under the name Naropin by AstraZeneca, it is provided as the S-enantiomer of the racemic mixture of its enantiomers. Ropivacaine functions by inhibiting the generation and conduction of nerve impulses. Its action involves blocking sodium channels in nerve cells, which prevents the depolarization necessary for initiating action potentials. The pharmacokinetics of ropivacaine vary according to the dose, route of administration, and the condition of the patient. After epidural administration, the drug follows a complete and biphasic absorption pattern.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Ropivacaine targets the sodium channel protein, specifically the SCN10A subunit, which plays a crucial role in the mechanism by which the drug prevents depolarization of nerve cells. The drug undergoes extensive metabolism, predominantly via the CYP1A2 enzyme, and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. These enzymes carry out aromatic hydroxylation and other metabolic transformations resulting in various metabolites such as 3-OH-ropivacaine and PPX, which are less pharmacologically active compared to the parent compound. Ropivacaine also interacts with carriers like ORM1 (Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1), which might influence its distribution and availability in the body.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of ropivacaine involves key enzymes that metabolize the drug. CYP1A2 is the primary enzyme responsible for its metabolism; variations in the CYP1A2 gene can affect the metabolic rate and efficacy of ropivacaine. Additionally, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 also contribute to the drug's metabolism; polymorphisms or genetic variants in these genes could modify the drug's pharmacokinetics and overall clinical response. Patients carrying certain genetic variants might experience differences in drug concentration and duration of anesthesia or could be at an increased risk for toxicity. However, specific highly impactful pharmacogenetic associations for ropivacaine have not been well-established and may require further clinical research to better define any significant gene-drug interactions.
