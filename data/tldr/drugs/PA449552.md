## Drug Summary

Etoposide, also known under various names such as Etopofos, Lastet, Nexvep, Vepesid K, and Vépéside, is a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin with significant antitumor activity. It functions by forming a complex with DNA and topoisomerase II, inducing breaks in double-stranded DNA and inhibiting repair, leading to cell death predominantly during the G2 and S phases of the cell cycle. Etoposide is utilized in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents to treat refractory testicular tumors and is a first-line treatment in small cell lung cancer, along with other malignancies including lymphoma, non-lymphocytic leukemia, and glioblastoma multiforme. It exhibits variable oral absorption, with a bioavailability ranging from 25% to 75%, and primarily undergoes hepatic metabolism predominantly via the CYP3A4 pathway.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers

Etoposide primarily targets DNA topoisomerase II (TOP2A and TOP2B), interfering with DNA synthesis by inhibiting the re-ligation of the DNA strands during cell division, leading to cell apoptosis. Its metabolism involves several enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP3A5, and CYP3A4 for oxidative reactions, and UGT1A1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 for conjugation reactions involved in detoxification. Several prostaglandin synthases (PTGS1 and PTGS2) are implicated in the bioactivation to quinone forms. Etoposide is also a substrate for multiple transporters including ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), ABCC1, ABCC2, ABCC3, ABCC6, ABCC10, and ABCG2, which can significantly influence its distribution and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics

The pharmacogenetics of etoposide are influenced by variations in genes coding for metabolizing enzymes and transport proteins. Polymorphisms in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 can affect the clearance of etoposide, impacting both efficacy and toxicity. Variants in UGT1A1 may alter glucuronidation rate, potentially modifying toxicity profiles, particularly in terms of myelosuppression and gastrointestinal effects. Moreover, GSTP1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms alter detoxification capabilities, possibly affecting both the drug’s efficacy and adverse event profile. Transporter gene polymorphisms, especially in ABCB1 and ABCG2, might influence etoposide's intracellular concentration, affecting therapy outcome and resistance. These pharmacogenetic factors are crucial for personalizing etoposide dosing to maximize therapeutic benefit while minimizing toxicity.
