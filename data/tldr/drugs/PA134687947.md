## Drug Summary
Eletriptan is a selective serotonin (5-HT) receptor agonist, specifically targeting the 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT1F receptors, used for the acute treatment of migraine headaches with or without aura in adults. It belongs to the second generation of triptans, a class developed for their effectiveness in alleviating migraine by inducing vasoconstriction of intracranial blood vessels and inhibiting pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release in the trigeminal nerve system. Eletriptan is well absorbed orally, with an approximate 50% bioavailability, and is primarily metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme in the liver. Its action includes a decrease in carotid arterial blood flow and modest increases in arterial blood pressure, with minimal activity at other central nervous system receptor sites.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Eletriptan acts primarily through the serotonin receptors HTR1B, HTR1D, and HTR1F, with additional minor activity on HTR1A. These receptors are involved in the vasoconstrictive and anti-inflammatory effects that alleviate migraine symptoms. Metabolically, eletriptan is predominantly processed by cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP3A4, and to lesser extents by CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2A6. Prostaglandin G/H synthase 1 (PTGS1) is also involved but its specific role in metabolism is less clear. Additionally, eletriptan is a substrate for the transporter protein P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), which may affect its distribution and excretion. There are no significant carriers noted for eletriptan.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors influence the efficacy and metabolism of eletriptan. Specifically, variability in the CYP3A4 enzyme, which is the primary pathway for eletriptan metabolism, can affect drug levels and response. Polymorphisms in CYP3A4 could potentially alter the metabolic rate, leading to differences in drug exposure among individuals. Moreover, a pharmacogenomic association identified involves the GNB3 gene; the rs5443 genotype in GNB3 correlates with an increased likelihood of response to eletriptan in individuals experiencing cluster headaches. This highlights the importance of genetic factors in predicting patient response to treatment, although broad applicability and confirmation in diverse populations are essential for clinical implementation.
