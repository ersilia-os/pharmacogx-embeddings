## Drug Summary
Entacapone, also known as Anxopone or Comtade, is a selective and reversible inhibitor of the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). It is utilized primarily as an adjunct treatment in Parkinson's disease, specifically to enhance the effects of levodopa/carbidopa therapy. By inhibiting COMT, Entacapone prevents the breakdown of dopamine, thereby increasing its availability and ameliorating symptoms of Parkinson's. This mechanism also results in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain which helps in reducing the parkinsonian syndrome manifestations. Generally, Entacapone is rapidly absorbed, with an absolute bioavailability of about 35%, and is primarily metabolized through isomerization to the cis-isomer followed by glucuronidation.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Entacapone acts by inhibiting the enzyme COMT, which is involved in the methylation of catechol structures like dopamine, thus affecting their clearance and activity. This drug is particularly active in peripheral tissues which contributes to its effects on plasma levodopa levels. Metabolism of Entacapone involves primarily the enzymes CYP2D6 and UGT1A9 along with COMT itself. CYP2D6 is involved in the oxidative metabolism while UGT1A9 contributes to the conjugation and subsequent elimination of the drug. There are no specific transporters or carriers listed for Entacapone, which suggests that its transport across cell membranes might involve passive diffusion or non-specific transport mechanisms.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of Entacapone mainly involves its metabolism. Variations in CYP2D6, a key enzyme in its metabolic pathway, can influence the drug's plasma levels and effectiveness. CYP2D6 polymorphisms are well-known to alter enzyme activity ranging from poor to ultra-rapid metabolism, which could potentially affect Entacapone's therapeutic outcomes. Patients with poor metabolizer status may experience increased drug exposure and possibly more adverse effects, whereas ultra-rapid metabolizers might have reduced drug efficacy due to faster clearance. Although explicit pharmacogenetic recommendations for Entacapone are not fully established, monitoring and possibly adjusting the dose in patients known to have altered CYP2D6 enzyme activity could be beneficial.
