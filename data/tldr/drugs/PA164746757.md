## Drug Summary
Tolterodine, marketed under the brand name Detrusitol, is an antimuscarinic agent primarily used for the management of overactive bladder, which presents with symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, or urge incontinence. It operates by competitively antagonizing muscarinic receptors (M2 and M3 subtypes), which are involved in the contraction of the urinary bladder and salivation. Tolterodine is metabolized in the liver to form a major active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyltolterodine, which similarly inhibits muscarinic receptors. Together, these compounds help increase residual urine and decrease detrusor pressure, aligning with their antimuscarinic activity directed towards improving symptoms of bladder overactivity.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Tolterodine and its active metabolite function by binding competitively to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors which include CHRM1, CHRM2, CHRM3, CHRM4, and CHRM5. These receptors are primarily linked to cholinergic signaling pathways that influence various bodily functions like bladder muscle contraction. Both tolterodine and 5-hydroxymethyltolterodine display high specificity to these receptors and have negligible effects on other neurotransmitter receptors or cellular targets. The drug is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which play a significant role in its biotransformation into active metabolites.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors influence the response and tolerability of tolterodine in different individuals. Genetic variations in the metabolizing enzymes CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 can affect the rate of metabolism of tolterodine, leading to variations in drug levels and, consequently, therapeutic efficacy and adverse effect profiles. For instance, individuals with poor metabolizer phenotypes of CYP2D6 might experience higher plasma concentrations of tolterodine, potentially increasing the risk of adverse effects. Similarly, variations in CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 can modify clinical responses, necessitating dose adjustments. These pharmacogenetics considerations are critical for optimizing treatment with tolterodine and enhancing therapeutic outcomes while minimizing side effects.
