## Drug Summary
Decitabine, marketed under the brand name Dacogen®, is a nucleoside analog of 2’-deoxycytidine and serves as an antineoplastic agent used predominantly in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), which can progress to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). The drug is a prodrug that requires intracellular uptake and phosphorylation to be converted into its active form, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine-triphosphate. This active form is incorporated into DNA during replication. Decitabine acts primarily by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), leading to global DNA hypomethylation, which can reactivate silenced tumor suppressor genes. It exhibits its pharmacological effects by causing a decrease in neoplastic cell proliferation. The absorption parameters suggest robust systemic availability post-intravenous administration, as indicated by its pharmacokinetic profile involving a C_max of 73.8 ng/mL and an AUC_0-∞ of 163 ng*h/mL in one dosing schedule.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Decitabine exerts its therapeutic effect by targeting DNA methyltransferase enzymes, specifically DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B. These enzymes are responsible for adding methyl groups to DNA, and their inhibition by decitabine causes hypomethylation of DNA. The drug is phosphorylated by several kinases including deoxycytidine kinase (DCK), UMP-CMP kinase (CMPK1), and nucleoside diphosphokinase (NME1, NME2). Cytidine deaminase (CDA) is involved in the metabolism of decitabine, indicating a route through which the drug can be cleared from the body. Decitabine is also transported into cells via the sodium/nucleoside cotransporter 1 (SLC28A1), crucial for its intracellular activation. The process of getting decitabine from its prodrug form into an active DNA-incorporated drug illustrates the importance of these molecular interactions.

## Pharmacogenetics
The efficacy and toxicity of decitabine can be influenced by genetic variations in genes encoding its metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Variants in DCK, which is responsible for the phosphorylation step critical for decitabine activation, could potentially alter drug efficacy, though specific pharmacogenetic data are currently limited. Similarly, polymorphisms in CDA, which deaminates decitabine, could affect the drug’s degradation and systemic levels, impacting both its therapeutic and adverse effects. Furthermore, variations in SLC28A1 may influence the cellular uptake of decitabine, thus modifying its clinical effectiveness. While direct pharmacogenetic correlations in clinical settings are still under investigation, these genetic factors are potential areas for future personalized medicine strategies in the treatment of MDS with decitabine.
