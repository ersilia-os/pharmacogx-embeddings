## Drug Summary
Elagolix is an orally administered, non-peptide, small molecule gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist, marketed under the brand name Orilissa. It is primarily indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis. By competitively binding to GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland, elagolix inhibits endogenous GnRH signaling, leading to a reduction in luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels. This results in decreased production of ovarian sex hormones, estradiol, and progesterone, which are critical in the proliferation of endometrial lesions. Elagolix has a rapid Tmax of about 1 hour, and its absorption can be decreased by high-fat meals. Metabolism is predominantly through the CYP3A family, with lesser involvement of CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and uridine glucuronosyl transferases (UGTs).

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Elagolix specifically targets the GnRH receptor (GNRHR), leading to the suppression of estrogen-dependent symptoms of endometriosis. Metabolism involves several cytochrome P450 enzymes, primarily CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A43, CYP3A7, CYP2D6, and CYP2C8, which play significant roles in drug biotransformation. Transporters involved with elagolix include ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1) and SLCO1B1 (solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1), which may influence the drug's absorption and distribution. No specific carriers are noted in the provided data.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic insights for elagolix are focused on enzyme and transporter interactions. The drug's metabolism by CYP3A4 suggests that genetic variations in this enzyme can impact elagolix's pharmacokinetic profile. Variants in CYP3A4 and related isoenzymes like CYP3A5 might lead to altered drug metabolism, affecting efficacy and safety. Additionally, polymorphisms in ABCB1, the gene encoding P-glycoprotein, could modify drug transport and consequently exposure. Although direct pharmacogenetic associations are not extensively documented in the existing literature or databases, these inferred interactions could prompt further individualization of therapy based on a patient's genetic makeup. These potential pharmacogenetic effects warrant consideration in clinical settings, particularly in managing dose adjustments and predicting adverse drug reactions.
