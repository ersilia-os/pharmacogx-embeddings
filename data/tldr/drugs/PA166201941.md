## Drug Summary
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is an antiretroviral medication used primarily in the treatment of HIV infection and chronic hepatitis B. It belongs to the class of nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). TDF is a prodrug of tenofovir, which needs to be converted in vivo to its active form, tenofovir diphosphate. This active metabolite then incorporates into viral DNA by reverse transcriptase, causing premature termination of DNA transcription. TDF is administered orally and is generally well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It exhibits a long half-life, allowing for once-daily dosing. TDF is predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Being a prodrug, the pharmacodynamics relate primarily to its active metabolite, tenofovir diphosphate. This metabolite inhibits the enzyme HIV reverse transcriptase (RT), a crucial enzyme responsible for transcribing viral RNA into DNA, crucial for viral replication. This mechanism of action allows it to be effective not only against HIV but also against hepatitis B virus (HBV), which also utilizes reverse transcriptase. As for its pharmacokinetics, tenofovir is converted from tenofovir disoproxil in the intestine and liver before becoming active. The transporters involved in the excretion process include those in kidneys such as OAT1 and OAT3 which participate in renal tubular secretion.

## Pharmacogenetics
There are pharmacogenetics considerations relating to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, primarily related to its transportation and renal clearance. Variants in genes coding for organic anion transporters such as OAT1 (SLC22A6) and OAT3 (SLC22A8) can influence tenofovir clearance, impacting drug efficacy and toxicity. Patients with variants leading to reduced transporter activity might exhibit higher plasma levels of tenofovir, increasing the risk for adverse effects, including nephrotoxicity. Pharmacogenetic testing, although not customarily part of routine clinical practice for TDF treatment, can assist in tailoring therapy for optimal efficacy and safety, particularly in patients with existing renal impairment or those presenting with drug-related renal toxicity.
