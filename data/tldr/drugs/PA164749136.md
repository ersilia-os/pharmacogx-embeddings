## Drug Summary
Desflurane, with DrugBank ID DB01189, is a volatile anesthetic that is characterized by its rapid onset and clearance, making it highly effective for both the induction and maintenance of anesthesia in adults and children. It offers distinct advantages over older inhaled anesthetics like methoxyflurane, sevoflurane, enflurane, and isoflurane due to its minimal metabolism and faster recovery times. Desflurane was first approved by the FDA in 1992. The drug is generally well-tolerated but remains under investigation for effects such as malignant hyperthermia, QTc prolongation, respiratory side effects, especially in pediatric populations, and its limited metabolism through pathways such as defluorination by CYP2E1.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Desflurane targets various proteins associated with nervous system signaling, such as multiple subunits of the GABA(A) receptor including GABRA1, GABRA2 and others, and the glycine receptor subunit alpha-1 (GLRA1). It antagonizes glutamate receptors and induces potassium voltage-gated channels, which play roles in neural excitability and neurotransmission. Desflurane also interacts with mitochondrial targets like NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 1 (MT-ND1) and influences various calcium transporting ATPases (e.g., ATP2C1, ATP2B1), which could affect intracellular signaling pathways. It is metabolized minimally by the enzyme CYP2E1. The drug binds to carriers such as serum albumin (ALB), potentially influencing its distribution or activity.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic implications of desflurane focus mainly on its metabolism by CYP2E1, an enzyme known for its genetic variability. Different alleles of CYP2E1 can significantly alter its enzyme activity, leading to variability in the metabolism of drugs metabolized through this pathway, although desflurane's minimal metabolism by CYP2E1 might limit the clinical significance of these variations. Research into polymorphisms within genes encoding GABA(A) receptor subunits might further elucidate variations in patient sensitivity or resistance to desflurane, affecting anesthesia management. Nevertheless, comprehensive pharmacogenetic data specific to desflurane is not widely described, indicating an area for future investigation.
