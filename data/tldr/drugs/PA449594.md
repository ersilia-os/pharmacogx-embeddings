## Drug Summary
Fenofibrate, also known as Fenogal, Lipanthyl, Lipantil, and Lipidil, is a fibric acid derivative used to treat various lipid disorders. It is particularly effective in reducing LDL-C, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and Apo B, while increasing HDL-C in adults with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia, as prescribed alongside dietary adjustments. Fenofibrate is also indicated for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia. The drug was approved by the FDA on December 31, 1993. Pharmacodynamically, fenofibrate acts by activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) which leads to modification in lipid metabolism.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Fenofibrate primarily targets PPARα, a critical regulator in lipid metabolism that increases lipolysis and decreases apoprotein C-III levels. This promotes the use of triglycerides as an energy source. Other biological targets include NR1I2 (nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 2) and MMP25 (Matrix metalloproteinase-25), although their precise roles in the therapeutic effects of fenofibrate are less clear. Key enzymes involved in fenofibrate's metabolism include liver carboxylesterase 1 (CES1), which hydrolyzes fenofibrate to its active moiety, fenofibric acid, and several others like UGT1A9, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19, which contribute to its further metabolism and glucuronidation. The drug is known to interact with transporters such as ABCB11 and carriers such as serum albumin (ALB), facilitating its systemic circulation and excretion.

## Pharmacogenetics
Fenofibrate's pharmacogenetic profile indicates that variants in the genes encoding its metabolic enzymes and transporter proteins could potentially affect drug efficacy and safety. Specifically, polymorphisms in genes like CYP2C8 and CYP2C19 may influence the metabolic rate of fenofibrate, thereby altering drug levels and therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, UGT1A9 polymorphisms could lead to variability in glucuronidation rates, impacting drug elimination. Enzymatic activity variations like those in CES1 might also contribute to differential responses among patients. Pharmacogenetic testing may therefore provide insights into personalized dosing or risk of adverse effects, although more comprehensive clinical genetic studies are needed to fully integrate these findings into routine clinical use.
