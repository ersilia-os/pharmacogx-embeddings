## Drug Summary
Vandetanib, also known as Zactima or Zictifa, is a kinase inhibitor used primarily in the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer. Approved by the FDA in 2011, it is indicated for patients with nonresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic forms of the disease. Vandetanib acts as an oral once-daily medication that inhibits tumor angiogenesis and cell proliferation, potentially useful across a broad range of tumor types. Its mechanism of action involves inhibition of key enzymes like VEGFR, EGFR, and RET, which are involved in cancer cell growth and new blood vessel formation. Vandetanib's absorption is slow, with peak plasma concentrations reached at around 6 hours post-administration, and it accumulates significantly with steady state achieved after approximately 3 months. It is metabolized primarily through CYP3A4 along with other enzymes, with unchanged drug and its metabolites found in plasma, urine, and feces.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Vandetanib targets several pivotal enzymes in cancer pathways, including VEGFR (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor), EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), PTK6 (Protein-tyrosine Kinase 6), TEK (Angiopoietin-1 Receptor), and RET (Proto-oncogene Tyrosine-protein Kinase Receptor Ret), all of associated with growth factor signaling and angiogenesis. The enzymes involved in its metabolism include CYP3A4, FMO1 and FMO3, which are essential in the oxidation processes that lead to the drug's breakdown. Transporters such as ABCC1, ABCG2, SLC22A2, and ABCB1 are involved in the drug's cellular transport, affecting its distribution and elimination. Carriers like ORM1 (Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1) and ALB (Serum Albumin) contribute to its pharmacokinetic profile by possibly affecting plasma binding.

## Pharmacogenetics
Vandetanib’s metabolic process involves significant pharmacogenetic implications, particularly with enzymes like CYP3A4. Variability in CYP3A4 activity, due to genetic polymorphisms, can markedly influence vandetanib's metabolism, potentially affecting both therapeutic efficacy and toxicity. Additionally, polymorphisms in efflux transporter genes such as ABCB1 and influx transporter genes like SLC22A2 may affect the drug’s absorption and disposition. While specific pharmacogenetic guidelines for vandetanib are not extensively established, knowledge of these gene variants could be crucial for optimizing individual dosing and minimizing adverse effects, especially in a drug known for QT interval prolongation. Further research into RET, EGFR, and VEGFR gene variations may also reveal insights into differential responses to vandetanib therapy, considering their pivotal role in its mechanism of action.
