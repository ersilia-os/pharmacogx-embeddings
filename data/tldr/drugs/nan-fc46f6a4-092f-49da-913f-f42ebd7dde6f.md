## Drug Summary
Pretomanid is an antimycobacterial drug used in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid to treat adults with drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), specifically resistance to agents like isoniazid and rifampin, as well as in cases where patients are intolerant or unresponsive to standard therapies. This drug regimen shortens the duration and enhances the success rate of treatment regimes that traditionally may take longer and prove ineffective. Pretomanid is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract with increased bioavailability when taken with a high-fat meal. The metabolism of pretomanid involves both reductive and oxidative pathways, with CYP3A4 being responsible for a significant portion of its oxidative metabolism. It acts as a prodrug, activated primarily by a nitroreductase enzyme.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Pretomanid targets primarily bacterial proteins related to the pathophysiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Important targets include the Fatty acid synthetase (fas), which is crucial for bacterial lipid synthesis, and nucleoid-associated protein Lsr2. It also affects the cyd operon, which is involved in the bacteria’s respiratory process. The nitroreductase enzyme Ddn metabolically activates pretomanid, which becomes bactericidal under anaerobic conditions by inducing nitric oxide production. Human transporter proteins affected include SLC22A8, which may play a role in the drug’s cellular uptake and distribution. No specific carriers are documented for pretomanid.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pretomanid’s effectiveness and safety could be influenced by genetic variations in the enzymes and transporters it interacts with. As CYP3A4 contributes to its metabolism, genetic polymorphisms in this enzyme that alter enzyme activity could influence pretomanid’s pharmacokinetics and potential drug-drug interactions, especially with other medications metabolized through the same pathway. Such variations might affect drug levels, efficacy, and safety profiles, including risks for hepatotoxicity and QT prolongation noted with its use. However, specific pharmacogenetic markers directly linked to pretomanid have not been well-established in published literature, indicating an area where additional research could be beneficial for optimizing treatment with pretomanid and reducing adverse effects.
