## Drug Summary
Troglitazone, formerly marketed under brand names such as Noscal, Resulin, Rezulin, and Romozin, is a thiazolidinedione class antidiabetic agent. It was primarily used for the treatment of Type II diabetes mellitus, targeting insulin resistance. Troglitazone acts by lowering blood glucose levels through enhancing target cell response to insulin. It promotes insulin-dependent glucose disposal in skeletal muscle and reduces hepatic glucose production. This drug mechanism is heavily reliant on the presence of insulin, binding predominantly to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARÎ³) which regulates genes critical for glucose and lipid metabolism. Despite its efficacy, Troglitazone was withdrawn from the market in 2000 due to significant risks of hepatotoxicity and has since been replaced by other medications like pioglitazone and rosiglitazone.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Troglitazone targets multiple receptors including PPARG (predominantly), PPARD, PPARA, and others such as ESRRG, ESRRA, and GSTP1, which play a role in metabolic regulation and cellular function. The enzymes primarily involved in Troglitazone metabolism include several cytochrome P450 isoforms such as CYP3A4, CYP2C9 amongst others like UGT1A subfamily, illustrating its extensive metabolic pathway. These enzymes are responsible for creating both active and inactive metabolites seen in systemic circulation and excretion. Troglitazone interaction is also noted with transporters like ABCB11 and SLCO1B1, which may affect its hepatic uptake and biliary excretion, potentially linking to its hepatotoxic effects.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of Troglitazone is complex due to its interaction with various cytochrome P450 enzymes which are highly polymorphic. Particularly, polymorphisms in CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 could potentially influence Troglitazone's metabolism and plasma levels, affecting both efficacy and toxicity. Patients with specific variants of these genes might experience different levels of drug efficacy and side-effects. Although comprehensive pharmacogenetic data specific to Troglitazone is limited, inference based on these enzymes and associated genetic variations can guide personalized medicine in other similar thiazolidinediones. The observed hepatotoxicity leading to its market withdrawal suggests a potential genetic predisposition, which underscores the need for further pharmacogenetic investigations.
