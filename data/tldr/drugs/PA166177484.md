## Drug Summary
Enasidenib is an orally administered, allosteric inhibitor specifically targeting mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) variants. Approved by the FDA in 2017, enasidenib is indicated for adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who harbor IDH2 mutations. These specific mutations, present in about 12-20% of AML cases, lead to abnormal cell differentiation and proliferation. Enasidenib's mechanism involves the reduction of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) levels, leading to decreased DNA and histone hypermethylation, thereby restoring normal cellular differentiation and reducing leukemia cell viability. Its pharmacokinetics reveals a peak concentration and an area under the curve that suggest dose-proportional increases, with steady-state levels reached within about a month of daily dosing.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Enasidenib exerts its therapeutic effects primarily through inhibition of the mutant enzymes IDH2-R140Q, IDH2-R172S, and IDH2-R172K more potently than the wild-type IDH2. This targeted action disrupts a neomorphic activity that produces the oncometabolite 2-HG. Enasidenib is metabolized by a broad spectrum of cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, along with multiple UDP glucuronosyltransferases such as UGT1A1, UGT1A3, and UGT1A9. Transport mechanisms involve key proteins such as P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and various solute carriers like SLC22A6 and SLCO1B1. These proteins are crucial for the absorption and disposition of the drug within the body. 

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic implications of enasidenib are significant due to its specific inhibition of mutated IDH2. The presence and type of IDH2 mutations can profoundly affect the drug's efficacy, necessitating genetic testing before initiating therapy to ensure appropriate patient selection. Given enasidenibâ€™s metabolism by multiple CYP and UGT enzymes, genetic variations in these enzymes could potentially influence drug levels and effects, although specific pharmacogenetic guidelines for these interactions have not been established. Variants in transporters like ABCB1 and SLCO1B1 could also modify drug pharmacokinetics and response, indicating that genetic factors can play a crucial role in the personalized administration of enasidenib. Thus, understanding the genetic background of the patient can substantially guide the therapeutic strategy, optimizing efficacy and minimizing toxicities.
