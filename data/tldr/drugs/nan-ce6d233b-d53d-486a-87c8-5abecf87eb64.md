## Drug Summary
Doxycycline is a broad-spectrum tetracycline-class antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections, including respiratory tract infections, skin infections, urinary tract infections, and certain sexually transmitted diseases. It is also used to treat acne and as a prophylactic treatment against malaria. Doxycycline works by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria, inhibiting protein synthesis, thus preventing bacterial growth. The drug is well absorbed orally and its absorption is not significantly affected by food. It is widely distributed in body tissues and fluids, and is eliminated primarily in the feces as active substances and partially in the urine. Doxycycline has a half-life of approximately 18 hours and can be taken once or twice daily depending on the indication.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Doxycycline primarily targets bacterial ribosomes, specifically binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, which interferes with the attachment of tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex. This action inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, ultimately leading to the cessation of bacterial growth and reproduction. Doxycycline is not extensively metabolized by liver enzymes, which minimizes drug interactions involving hepatic metabolism. There are no significant transporters or carriers involved in its active transport or distribution, as doxycycline diffuses passively across biological membranes due to its lipophilic nature.

## Pharmacogenetics
Although doxycycline is generally subject to minimal metabolic processing, the pharmacokinetics of doxycycline can still be influenced by genetic factors affecting drug absorption and elimination. For instance, variations in genes encoding hepatic enzymes and transport proteins might influence the drug's bioavailability and clearance rates. However, specific pharmacogenetic markers directly influencing doxycycline effectiveness or toxicity have not been well-established in the literature. It's inferred that genetic variations, such as those in the multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) transporters, could potentially affect doxycycline's renal excretion, modifying drug levels and response. Further research into the pharmacogenomics of doxycycline could potentially enhance the predictability of its efficacy and safety among different individuals.
