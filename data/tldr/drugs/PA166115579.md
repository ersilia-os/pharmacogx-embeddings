## Drug Summary
Pamaquine, an 8-aminoquinoline compound, is an antimalarial drug primarily used for the radical cure of relapsing malaria caused by *Plasmodium vivax* and *Plasmodium ovale*. It acts by targeting the dormant liver stages (hypnozoites) of the malaria parasite, thereby preventing relapses. Pamaquine is considered the first synthetic antimalarial agent, but its use has declined due to the development of safer alternatives like primaquine. The pharmacokinetics of pamaquine involve its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and subsequent distribution throughout the body, including significant uptake in the liver. Metabolism of pamaquine is primarily hepatic, and it is known to induce methemoglobinemia as a side effect.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Given the absence of specific detailed data from DrugBank and the vintage nature of pamaquine as a drug, comprehensive details on its molecular targets, enzymes, transporters, and carriers remain clinically understudied compared to newer antimalarials. It likely shares some pharmacological pathways with newer 8-aminoquinolines, such as interference with the electron transport in the parasite, but specific protein targets in the malaria parasite or human host are not well characterized.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic implications for pamaquine are not as well-documented as for its successor, primaquine. However, like other 8-aminoquinolines, pamaquine's efficacy and safety could be influenced by genetic variations in enzymes involved in drug metabolism. For instance, genetic variants of G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) can predispose patients to hemolytic anemia upon taking 8-aminoquinolines, suggesting a similar risk could exist with pamaquine. Further research into specific pharmacogenetic associations is needed, which might elucidate more about its metabolism, efficacy, and safety profile based on individual genetic makeups.
