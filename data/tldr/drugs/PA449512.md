## Drug Summary
Estrone is a naturally occurring steroid estrogen primarily produced in the ovaries, placenta, and peripheral tissues like adipose tissue, with peripheral conversion from androstenedione. Its production increases after menopause, making it the predominant circulating estrogen during this phase. Despite having one-third the estrogenic potency of estradiol, estrone is crucial for managing perimenopausal and postmenopausal symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms, atrophic vaginitis, and vulvar atrophy. It helps in osteoporosis prevention and treats conditions related to gonadotropin hormone dysfunction. Estroneâ€™s pharmacodynamics involve binding to estrogen receptors, altering gene transcription which affects protein synthesis. It exhibits an absorption rate of approximately 43% and is metabolized primarily in the liver.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Estrone interacts with several important molecular targets, including the estrogen receptors ESR1 (estrogen receptor alpha) and ESR2 (estrogen receptor beta), and the androgen receptor (AR). The cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP3A4, CYP1B1, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2E1, CYP3A5, CYP1A2, and CYP1A1, are involved in its hepatic metabolism. Transporters like SLCO2B1, ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), SLCO1A2, ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2), SLCO1B1, and SLC22A8 also play roles in its pharmacokinetics, facilitating its distribution and excretion. Furthermore, serum albumin (ALB) acts as a carrier, aiding in the transport of estrone through the bloodstream.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic effects concerning estrone relate primarily to variations in the CYP450 enzyme genes that metabolize the drug and in the genes coding for its transporters and receptors. Differences in CYP3A4 or CYP1B1 enzyme activity due to genetic polymorphisms can influence the drug's efficacy and safety profile, potentially leading to variability in drug exposure and response among individuals. Moreover, genetic variations in estrogen receptors (ESR1 and ESR2) could modulate the physiological response to estrone, impacting therapeutic outcomes in hormone-related treatments. While specific pharmacogenetic guidelines for estrone are not extensively documented, these genetic factors are likely to play significant roles in clinical responses and personalized medicine approaches for hormone replacement therapies.
