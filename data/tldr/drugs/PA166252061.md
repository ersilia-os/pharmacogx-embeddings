## Drug Summary
Infigratinib, marketed under the brand name Truseltiq, is a pan-fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) kinase inhibitor used primarily in the treatment of previously treated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma in adults. This cancer type is a primary malignancy of the biliary tract and requires FGFR2 fusion or rearrangements for infigratinib's indication. The drug functions by inhibiting FGFR pathways, suppressing tumor growth. FDA granted accelerated approval on May 28, 2021, after observing significant therapeutic benefits from clinical trials. Infigratinib exhibits varied pharmacokinetics: absorption is influenced by meal type, reaching a steady-state within about 15 days, and is majorly metabolized by CYP3A4, contributing to different pharmacologically active metabolites.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Infigratinib acts as an ATP-competitive inhibitor for all FGFR subtypes - FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4. It is most effective against FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3. By binding to the ATP-binding cleft, it inhibits autophosphorylation and downstream signaling involved in cell proliferation and survival. Infigratinib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by FMO3. It interacts with several transporters including ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), ABCG2, SLC transporters (SLC47A1, SLC22A1, SLC22A2, and SLC47A2), and SLCO transporters (SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3), which can affect its distribution and excretion. One carrier, apolipoprotein LPA, is also associated with infigratinib.

## Pharmacogenetics
Infigratinib's effectiveness hinges significantly on genetic alterations, specifically FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements. Such genetic profiles are necessary for its prescribing, highlighting a direct pharmacogenetic association that necessitates an FDA-approved test before administration. Variations in the CYP3A4 enzyme could potentially influence infigratinib's metabolism and consequently its efficacy and safety, as this enzyme is responsible for the metabolism of approximately 94% of the drug. Additionally, genes associated with the transporters like ABCB1 or ABCG2 may affect the pharmacokinetics of infigratinib, potentially altering drug levels and responses. Further research into these pharmacogenetic interactions could improve patient selection and dosing customization, enhancing therapeutic outcomes and minimizing adverse effects.
