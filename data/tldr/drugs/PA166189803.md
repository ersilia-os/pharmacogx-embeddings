## Drug Summary
Upadacitinib is a selective Janus kinase (JAK)1 inhibitor indicated for the treatment of several autoimmune diseases such as moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohnâ€™s disease. Upadacitinib functions as a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) and was approved by the FDA in August 2019. The drug is designed to inhibit JAK1 selectively to minimize dose-related toxicities while preserving efficacy. Pharmacokinetically, upadacitinib shows dose-proportional profiles and reaches steady-state concentration within 4 days of once-daily oral dosing. Absorption is not significantly affected by food intake, and metabolism primarily involves CYP3A4, with minor involvement of CYP2D6.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Upadacitinib specifically targets the JAK1 enzyme, which plays a crucial role in the signal transduction pathways of various pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IFN, which are pivotal in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The drug's metabolism is predominantly managed by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP2D6. It interacts with transporters such as P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2), and solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (SLCO1B1). No specific carriers are mentioned for upadacitinib.

## Pharmacogenetics
Although the provided data does not include specific pharmacogenomic interactions for upadacitinib, its metabolism by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 implicates potential variability in drug levels based on genetic variations within these enzymes. Variants in CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 can affect the metabolic rate of the drug, influencing efficacy and safety. Additionally, genetic polymorphisms in transporters like ABCB1 and ABCG2 might alter drug disposition and responses. Patients with certain genetic backgrounds may require dose adjustments or experience different degrees of therapeutic effects or adverse reactions. However, detailed pharmacogenetic testing recommendations for upadacitinib are not established and would benefit from further research.
