## Drug Summary
Repaglinide, known commercially as GlucoNorm and Surepost, is an oral antihyperglycemic agent utilized primarily for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Structurally associated with the meglitinide class, repaglinide functions as a short-acting insulin secretagogue. Its primary action is to stimulate insulin release from the pancreatic β cells through a glucose-dependent mechanism that inhibits ATP-sensitive potassium channels. This results in the depolarization of cell membranes, followed by calcium influx and insulin secretion. Unlike sulfonylureas, repaglinide’s effect on insulin secretion requires the presence of glucose, making it particularly effective in controlling postprandial blood glucose spikes. The drug has a rapid onset, with peak plasma concentrations within 1 hour, and shows significant effects on both postprandial blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. It is largely metabolized by the liver, primarily via CYP3A4 and CYP2C8, with active and inactive metabolites excreted in feces and urine.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Repaglinide acts primarily through the inhibition of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (gene symbol: ABCC8) in pancreatic β cells. This class-specific action leads to the facilitated secretion of insulin in response to elevated blood glucose levels. The drug also affects peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), a nuclear receptor that influences insulin sensitization and lipid metabolism, contributing to its broader metabolic effects. Repaglinide is metabolized mainly by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4—important enzymes in the cytochrome P450 system. It is also transported by solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (SLCO1B1) and the bile salt export pump (ABCB11), which aids in its distribution and excretion. Additionally, serum albumin (ALB) serves as a carrier for repaglinide, impacting its pharmacokinetics through binding interactions.

## Pharmacogenetics
From a pharmacogenetic perspective, the metabolism and efficacy of repaglinide can vary significantly among individuals due to genetic variations. Important genes affecting its pharmacokinetics include CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, where polymorphisms can alter enzymatic activity leading to varied drug levels and effects. For instance, polymorphisms in CYP2C8 can lead to slower metabolism of repaglinide, potentially heightening the risk of hypoglycemia among carriers of certain variants. Although the drug is associated with SLCO1B1 and ABCB11 transporters, impacts of genetic variants in these transporters on repaglinide pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics remain less understood and would be of interest for future research. Given the mechanism of action through ABCC8, variations within this gene could theoretically influence treatment outcomes, although direct links have not been extensively validated. Therefore, considering genetic testing might be beneficial for optimizing repaglinide therapy, especially in patients with atypical responses or adverse effects.
