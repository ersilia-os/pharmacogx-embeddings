## Drug Summary
Ketoprofen, sold under various brand names such as Actron, Orudis, and Profenid, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) from the propionic acid class. It has analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Ketoprofen is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, primary dysmenorrhea, and mild to moderate pain related to musculoskeletal injuries and postoperative conditions. The pharmacodynamics of ketoprofen involve the inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2), which play a critical role in the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in inflammation, pain, and fever processes. Ketoprofen achieves high plasma levels rapidly within 0.5 to 2 hours post oral administration and is extensively metabolized in the liver primarily via conjugation with glucuronic acid, lacking active metabolites.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Ketoprofen targets cyclooxygenase enzymes; specifically, it inhibits PTGS1 (COX-1) and PTGS2 (COX-2), reducing prostaglandin synthesis which mediates pain and inflammatory responses. It also affects CXCR1 (C-X-C chemokine receptor type 1), which may contribute to its anti-inflammatory actions. The metabolism of ketoprofen is facilitated by enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C8, and UGT1A1, which are responsible for its hepatic metabolic processes. Various transporters including ABCC4 (MRP4), SLCO1A2, SLC22A6 (OAT1), SLC22A8 (OAT3), SLC22A11 (OAT4), and SLC22A7 (OAT2) are involved in its renal secretion and hepatic uptake, affecting the drug's pharmacokinetics. Additionally, ALB (serum albumin) acts as a carrier, potentially affecting its distribution and plasma protein binding.

## Pharmacogenetics
Ketoprofen's pharmacokinetics and response can be influenced by genetic variations in the enzymes metabolizing it, particularly CYP2C9 and CYP2C8. Variants in these genes can alter enzyme activity, potentially affecting drug levels, efficacy, and safety. For example, individuals with reduced function alleles of CYP2C9 might experience higher plasma levels of ketoprofen, increasing the risk of adverse effects. Similarly, genetic variations in transporters such as SLCO1A2 and ABCC4 can influence ketoprofen's renal and hepatic handling, thereby modifying exposure and response. While currently there is no specific pharmacogenomic guidelines for altering ketoprofen therapy based on genetic data, understanding these variations can assist in personalizing treatment plans in terms of dosing to optimize efficacy and minimize toxicity.
