## Drug Summary
Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet medication used primarily to prevent blood clots and subsequent myocardial infarction, stroke, and other cardiovascular issues in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), including both non-ST and ST-elevated myocardial infarction. It reduces risks of heart attacks and strokes by inhibiting platelet activation and aggregation. As an oral prodrug, clopidogrel is metabolized in the liver to produce an active metabolite that irreversibly inhibits the P2Y12 component of ADP receptors on the surface of platelets, thwarting the binding and activation process essential for platelet clumping. Its absorption is moderately affected by food, and it has a variable bioavailability. The drug was first approved by the FDA in 1997 and is marketed with doses typically ranging from 75-300 mg per day.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary therapeutic target of clopidogrel is the P2RY12 receptor on platelets. Regarding metabolism, multiple enzymes are involved: CYP2C19 plays a crucial role in converting clopidogrel into its active thiol-containing metabolite, alongside contributions from CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2C9. CES1 is responsible for the first-pass metabolism to an inactive form. Clopidogrel's absorption and distribution are mediated by transport proteins such as the P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and solute carriers like SLC22A1 and SLC22A2. It also binds to serum albumin (ALB), which may affect its transport and distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic variables significantly influence the metabolism, efficacy, and safety profile of clopidogrel. The activity of CYP2C19, in particular, has substantial clinical implications: polymorphisms in CYP2C19 (e.g., *rs4244285*, *rs4986893*) can lead to reduced enzyme activity and thus decreased formation of the active metabolite of clopidogrel, diminishing its antiplatelet effect. This reduced activity is associated with a higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events and diminished platelet response. Consequently, genetic testing for CYP2C19 polymorphisms is recommended to identify patients who may require alternative treatments. Furthermore, the metabolizer status influenced by CYP2C9 (*rs1057910*) allele variations also affects the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of the drug, emphasizing the need for personalized medicine approaches in the administration of clopidogrel.
