## Drug Summary
Thyrotropin alfa, commercially known as Thyrogen, is a recombinant form of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), primarily used to aid in the detection of residual or recurrent thyroid cancer in patients who have undergone thyroidectomy. It is utilized in conjunction with a radioactive diagnostic agent to enhance the detection of thyroid remnants or metastasis by stimulating iodine uptake into thyroid tissue. Structurally, thyrotropin alfa is a heterodimeric glycoprotein that closely resembles the human pituitary TSH, composed of an alpha and a beta subunit, where the alpha subunit is common to other hormones like hCG, LH, and FSH, and the beta subunit determines its receptor specificity. The pharmacokinetics of thyrotropin alfa reveal that it has a median time to peak of 10 hours post-intramuscular injection, with no metabolism data provided, suggesting its excretion might be primarily in the intact form or minimally metabolized.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Thyrotropin alfa specifically targets the Thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) on thyroid epithelial cells or thyroid cancer tissues. By binding to the TSHR, thyrotropin alfa stimulates the endogenous thyroid activity which includes the uptake and organification of iodine, essential processes for the production of thyroid hormones but also crucial for the radiodiagnostic imaging in post-thyroidectomy cancer patients. Thyrotropin alfa has no listed enzymes, transporters, or carriers involved in its action, distribution, or elimination according to the data provided, indicating that its action is mainly localized to the interaction with the TSH receptor.

## Pharmacogenetics
As for the pharmacogenetics of thyrotropin alfa, there is no specific genomic data provided in the provided DrugBank information or widely known significant associations. However, genetic polymorphisms in the TSH receptor gene (TSHR) could hypothetically influence the efficacy and safety of thyrotropin alfa, as variations in receptor structure or expression might affect the binding affinity and biological response to the drug. Although not explicitly documented, it is conceivable that individual variations in immune response to recombinant proteins could also play a role in treatment outcomes or adverse reactions due to immune-mediated responses against recombinant thyrotropin alfa, however, more detailed genomic studies would be required to establish these relationships.
