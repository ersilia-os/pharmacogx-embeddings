## Drug Summary
Capmatinib, marketed under the brand name Tabrecta, is a kinase inhibitor specifically targeting the c-Met receptor (hepatocyte growth factor receptor, HGFR). This drug is indicated for use in adults with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) linked with mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) exon 14 skipping mutations. Capmatinib inhibits both wild-type and mutant forms of the c-Met receptor, which is pathologically activated in several cancers due to mutations, amplifications, or overexpression leading to enhanced proliferative and survival signals via pathways like STAT3, PI3K/AKT, and RAS/MAPK. Its primary mechanism prevents phosphorylation of c-Met, thus arresting downstream oncogenic signaling. The oral bioavailability of capmatinib is over 70%, with peak plasma concentrations typically reached within 1 to 2 hours post-administration. Metabolism is primarily through CYP3A4 and aldehyde oxidase.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Capmatinib has a pronounced selectivity for the MET protein, a receptor tyrosine kinase crucial in cancer proliferation when altered. For metabolism, capmatinib primarily engages with cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and aldehyde oxidase (AOX1), and to a lesser extent CYP1A2, which may influence its pharmacokinetic profile. Various transporters are also involved in its pharmacokinetics, specifically ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), SLC47A1 and SLC47A2 (Multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins 1 and 2, respectively), and ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2), which could affect drug distribution and elimination. No specific carriers are listed for capmatinib.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic associations of capmatinib primarily revolve around its target, the MET gene, especially the presence of MET exon 14 skipping mutations which predict responsiveness to this therapy in NSCLC. Furthermore, variations in genes encoding metabolic enzymes (e.g., CYP3A4) and transporters (e.g., ABCB1, SLC47A1, ABCG2) might influence capmatinib's pharmacokinetics, although specific allele-related effects need further elucidation. Notably, patients with different genetic backgrounds in these enzymes and transporters could experience varied therapy outcomes or adverse effects. Thus, genotyping might aid in individualizing treatment regimens, enhancing efficacy, and minimizing toxicity. The importance of an FDA-approved test for detecting MET mutations underscores the critical role of pharmacogenetics in directing capmatinib use.
