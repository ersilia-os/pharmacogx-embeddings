## Drug Summary
Deleobuvir (DB14850) is an investigational drug that was explored for use in the treatment of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. The clinical trial with identifier NCT01983566 specifically examined the effects of food and gastric pH on the bioavailability of a single dose of deleobuvir in healthy Caucasian and Japanese subjects. Although not available detailed information about its pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and specific mechanism of action, this compound had been part of the family of non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors, designed to inhibit the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase essential for HCV replication.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
According to the provided information, there are no details available regarding the specific targets, enzymes, transporters, or carriers associated with deleobuvir. In the context of non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors for HCV, the expected target would generally be the NS5B polymerase, but without explicit data, this remains speculative for deleobuvir. Further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies would be needed to elaborate on how deleobuvir interacts with bodily systems, which enzymes metabolize it, and if any transporters or carriers significantly handle the drug.

## Pharmacogenetics
The provided DrugBank information and the associated PharmGKB ID do not include specific genomic data or pharmacogenetic interactions concerning deleobuvir. No known associations with genetic markers, such as variations in genes that could affect the drugâ€™s metabolism, efficacy, or toxicity, have been documented in the available literature. This absence of information does not rule out potential pharmacogenetic impacts but indicates that such associations either have not been thoroughly investigated or not found significant in the studies conducted to date. Future research could potentially uncover pharmacogenetic factors that might influence the treatment outcomes with deleobuvir.
