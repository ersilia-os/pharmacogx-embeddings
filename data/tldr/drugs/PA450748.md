## Drug Summary
Oxymorphone is a semi-synthetic opioid analgesic primarily used for the treatment of moderate to severe pain, including pain related to obstetrics. It shares many properties with morphine but lacks cough suppressant activity. The pharmacodynamics of oxymorphone involve its action as a potent analgesic affecting primarily the central nervous system (CNS) and the gastrointestinal tract. Its desired therapeutic effects are analgesia and sedation, primarily through respiratory depression caused by direct actions on the brainstem respiratory centers. It also affects pain modulation via inhibition of GABAergic interneurons, enhancing pain control pathways. Oxymorphone is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily excreted as metabolites and conjugates in urine. On a critical note, due to risks associated with opioid misuse and abuse, particularly its injectable form, the FDA requested the drug's removal from the market in 2017.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Oxymorphone acts predominantly on the mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1) located in various regions of the brain, including the amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, and spinal cord, which mediate its analgesic and sedative effects. Additionally, it binds to the delta-opioid receptor (OPRD1), though its contribution to oxymorphone's effects is less established. The drug undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism, prominently involving cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. These enzymes are crucial in the biotransformation of oxymorphone into various metabolites, which include oxymorphone conjugates and reduction products. The drug does not significantly involve transporters or carriers in its mechanism of action or disposition according to the provided data.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of oxymorphone primarily involves the metabolic enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Variants in the CYP2D6 gene can influence the metabolic rate of oxymorphone, potentially altering its efficacy and risk of adverse effects. Patients with reduced activity alleles of CYP2D6 may exhibit prolonged opioid effects or increased sensitivity due to slower metabolism and clearance of the drug, while those with multiple copies of the gene (ultrarapid metabolizers) could process the drug too quickly, reducing its effectiveness. Similarly, inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 can significantly affect oxymorphoneâ€™s plasma concentrations, leading to variability in therapeutic outcomes or risks of toxicity. Thus, understanding individual genetic variations in these enzymes can help tailor opioid therapy for safer and more effective pain management. However, specific genetic guidelines for oxymorphone use are not fully established, and clinical judgment in the context of patient-specific genetic makeup remains crucial.
