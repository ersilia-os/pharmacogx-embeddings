## Drug Summary
Citalopram, marketed under various brand names such as Akarin, Cipramil, and Seropram, is a prominent antidepressant in the class of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Approved by the FDA in 1998, it is principally utilized in the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. The drug exerts its antidepressant effects ostensibly through the potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, thereby enhancing its availability in synaptic clefts. Citalopram is absorbed well orally with a bioavailability of about 80% and reaches peak plasma concentrations around 4 hours post-dose. Its metabolism is primarily hepatic, transformed mainly through N-demethylation by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 into less pharmacologically active metabolites.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Citalopram's primary mechanism of action is its strong and selective inhibition of the neuronal serotonin transporter (SERT or SLC6A4), which significantly impairs serotonin reuptake enhancing its central nervous system availability. It exhibits minimal effect on norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake and has negligible affinity for various neurotransmitter receptors including histamine, muscarinic, and norepinephrine receptors. Key metabolic enzymes for citalopram include CYP3A4, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, MAOA, MAOB, and AOX1, primarily processing the drug in the liver to its demethylated forms, which are further handled by various enzymes including CYP1A2. One notable transporter affected by citalopram is ABCB1, better known as P-glycoprotein, which impacts the distribution and excretion of the drug.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic aspects of citalopram involve several genes that influence treatment efficacy and adverse effects. Variants of ABCB1, such as rs2032583, have been associated with differential treatment outcomes, in this case, an increased likelihood of remission in major depressive disorder when treated with citalopram. Polymorphisms in HTR2A (rs7997012) and GRIK4 (rs1954787) also correlate with increased response rates to this SSRI. On the adverse effect spectrum, variations in GRIK2, GRIA3, and CREB1 are implicated in increased risks of suicidal ideation and behaviors among patients taking citalopram, highlighting the importance of genetic factors in patient risk stratification and drug safety assessment. These genetic markers can guide more personalized treatment approaches, potentially improving therapeutic outcomes and minimizing risks.
