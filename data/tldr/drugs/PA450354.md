## Drug Summary
Melphalan is an alkylating agent belonging to the nitrogen mustard or bischloroethylamine type, primarily used for its cytotoxic and immunosuppressive effects in cancer treatment. It is synthesized by substituting L-phenylalanine for the methyl group on nitrogen mustard. Indications for melphalan include high-dose conditioning treatment prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma, palliative treatment of multiple myeloma, non-resectable epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, and as part of directed therapy for uveal melanoma with hepatic metastases. Melphalan acts by inducing DNA and RNA damage, leading to cell death. It is administered orally and intravenously but exhibits highly variable pharmacokinetics, attributed to differences in absorption, first-pass metabolism, and rapid hydrolysis. Toxicity includes severe bone marrow suppression, gastrointestinal damage, liver enzyme elevations, and nephrotoxicity.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Melphalan does not have specific enzyme targets listed but is known to be transported by several solute carriers including SLC22A3, SLC7A5, and SLC7A10. These transporters facilitate the drug's uptake into cells, crucial for its cytotoxic activity. It is also carried by proteins such as serum albumin (ALB) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1), which may influence its distribution and clearance. Melphalanâ€™s mechanism involves cross-linking DNA strands by binding to the N7 position of guanine, disrupting DNA synthesis and transcription, and it is active in both resting and rapidly dividing cells.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is no specific pharmacogenetic data provided in the summary, and broad data might not be abundantly available for melphalan. However, given its metabolism and transport mechanism involving several solute carriers, genetic variations in the genes encoding these proteins (like SLC22A3, SLC7A5, SLC7A10) could potentially affect the drug's efficacy and toxicity. Variability in these transporters could alter drug uptake, influencing therapeutic outcomes and side effect profiles. Genetic polymorphisms affecting the carriers such as ALB and ORM1 might also impact the drug's plasma protein binding and distribution. Further investigations into specific genetic markers and their impact on melphalan pharmacokinetics and dynamics would be useful for optimizing individual therapy plans.
