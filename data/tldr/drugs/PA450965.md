## Drug Summary
Pimozide, also known under trade names such as Halomonth, Neoperidole, and Opiran, is an antipsychotic medication classified in the diphenylbutylpiperidine group. It is notably used for the management of motor and phonic tics in patients with Tourette's Disorder, particularly in those who have not responded adequately to other treatments. Pimozide functions primarily by blocking dopaminergic receptors (particularly D2 subtype) in the central nervous system (CNS), which is believed to contribute to its effectiveness in suppressing tics. The drug is absorbed orally with more than 50% bioavailability, reaching peak serum levels around 6-8 hours post-ingestion. Its metabolism mainly involves significant first-pass effect in the liver, primarily via the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2, with a potential role for CYP2D6.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Pimozide acts mainly through blockade of the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) and to a lesser extent, dopamine D3 receptor (DRD3), which play critical roles in its antipsychotic effects. Additionally, it interacts with the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2 (KCNH2) and calmodulin (CALM1), suggesting a broader spectrum of neuronal activity modulation. The metabolism of Pimozide is significantly mediated by several cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7, indicating extensive hepatic processing. Transport across cell membranes involves the transporter P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1). No specific carriers have been identified that are involved in the pharmacokinetics of Pimozide.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of Pimozide involves significant interactions with genetic variants of the metabolizing enzymes, particularly CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2. CYP2D6 polymorphisms can considerably affect the drug's plasma levels, where individuals with poor metabolizer status might experience heightened exposure to Pimozide, potentially leading to an increased risk of side effects, whereas rapid metabolizers may have reduced drug efficacy. Similarly, variations in CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 may influence the drug's metabolism and overall pharmacokinetic profile. Clinicians should consider genotyping these enzyme systems in patients who experience unusual side effects or fail to respond to typical doses. No direct pharmacogenetic data of Pimozide on drug targets like DRD2 or transporters like ABCB1 are conclusively established, but these could also be influential, given their critical roles in drug action and disposition.
