## Drug Summary
Sotalol, marketed under various names such as Biosotal, Darob, and Sotacor, among others, is a methanesulfonanilide class III antiarrhythmic drug. Initially developed in 1960 and approved in 1992, sotalol is formulated as tablets, oral solutions, and intravenous injections. It is indicated for treating life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and maintaining normal sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter. The pharmacodynamics of sotalol involve the inhibition of rapid potassium channels, which lengthens the duration of action potentials and the refractory period across the atria and ventricles. Additionally, the drug exhibits beta-adrenergic blocking activity, which contributes to its antiarrhythmic effects. It has a high oral bioavailability (90-100%) but is not metabolized, and renal excretion is the primary elimination route.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Sotalol acts on multiple cardiac-specific targets to exert its therapeutic effects. It inhibits the Beta-1 adrenergic receptor (ADRB1) and Beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2), both of which are involved in heart rate and myocardial contractility regulation. Additionally, it influences the Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2 (KCNH2), which plays a critical role in cardiac repolarization. The action on these targets contributes to the prolongation of the QT interval and slowing of the heart rate, which are vital in managing arrhythmias. Sotalol does not appear to interact with any specific transporters or carriers according to the provided data. The enzyme Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is listed, which might indicate a role in the drug's pharmacokinetic profile, although it is noted that sotalol is not metabolized, hinting that CYP2D6 involvement might be minimal or related to minor metabolic pathways.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors influencing sotalol's efficacy and safety primarily revolve around variations in KCNH2 and the beta-adrenergic receptors. Specifically, genetic variations in these targets can affect the drugâ€™s action potential duration and refractory periods, impacting both efficacy and risk of adverse effects such as torsades de pointes. The involvement of CYP2D6 might suggest potential variability in drug levels and response among individuals with different CYP2D6 genotypes; however, given that sotalol is not substantially metabolized, this interaction may be clinically minor. There is a lack of robust data linking sotalol directly to specific pharmacogenetic markers in publicly available pharmacogenomic databases, necessitating more comprehensive studies to elucidate these relationships. Nevertheless, the genomic variants of the targets (ADRB1, ADRB2, KCNH2) might be of interest for further research or clinical consideration to prevent adverse outcomes or tailor therapy for better efficacy.
