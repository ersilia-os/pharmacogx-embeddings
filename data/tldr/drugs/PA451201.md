## Drug Summary
Quetiapine, marketed under the brand name Seroquel, is a second-generation atypical antipsychotic approved by the FDA in 1997. It is primarily used for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder (both manic and depressive episodes), and major depressive disorder, often in combination with other antidepressants. Quetiapine exhibits high therapeutic efficacy with a lower risk of side effects compared to older antipsychotics like clozapine and olanzapine. The drug operates by affecting various neurotransmitter receptors, including serotonin and dopamine receptors, which are pivotal in modulating mood and behavior. Quetiapine is known for its rapid and complete oral absorption, achieving peak plasma concentrations within 1.5 hours post-administration, and its bioavailability is significantly influenced by the presence of food.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Quetiapine interacts with a broad spectrum of neurotransmitter receptors. It primarily antagonizes the serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR1B, HTR1D, HTR1E, HTR2A, HTR2C, HTR3A, HTR6, HTR7) and dopamine receptors (DRD1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, DRD5). Additional targets include histamine H1 receptors (HRH1), alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors (ADRA1A, ADRA1B, ADRA1D, ADRA2A, ADRA2B, ADRA2C), and various muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1-5). The metabolism of quetiapine is predominantly hepatic, facilitated by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes, leading to various active and inactive metabolites. The drug is also a substrate for the transporter protein P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), which affects its distribution and excretion.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors significantly influence quetiapine’s pharmacokinetics and response variability among individuals. Variants in the CYP2D6 gene, which encodes an enzyme critical for the metabolism of quetiapine, can lead to differences in drug levels and effects. Poor metabolizers (individuals with inactive CYP2D6 alleles) may experience higher concentrations of quetiapine and thus an increased risk of adverse effects, whereas rapid metabolizers (those with multiple active copies of the CYP2D6 gene) may require higher doses to achieve therapeutic effects. Genetic variations in ABCB1 may also affect the drug’s efficacy and safety profile by altering the absorption and distribution of quetiapine. While detailed pharmacogenomic data could further optimize individual responses to quetiapine, these genetic considerations are increasingly important for tailoring psychiatric treatment to achieve optimal outcomes.
