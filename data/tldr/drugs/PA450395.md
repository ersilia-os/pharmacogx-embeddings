## Drug Summary
Metformin, including brand variations like Apo-Metformin, Gen-Metformin, Novo-Metformin, Nu-Metformin, and Sandoz Metformin, is a biguanide antihyperglycemic agent widely used as a first-line treatment for type II diabetes. Introduced in Canada in 1972 and later approved by the FDA in 1995, its primary action is to reduce hyperglycemia without causing hypoglycemia. Metformin operates through multiple mechanisms: decreasing hepatic glucose production, reducing intestinal glucose absorption, and enhancing insulin sensitivity. It does not provoke insulin secretion, distinguishing it from other antidiabetics like sulfonylureas. Metformin's pharmacokinetics reveals moderate bioavailability, with steady-state concentrations achieved within 24-48 hours post-administration. Its absorption varies with food intake, generally reducing peak plasma concentration and increasing time to peak. The drug primarily undergoes renal excretion without significant hepatic metabolism.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Metformin acts on various molecular targets. It inhibits mitochondrial complex I, impacting energy production critical to its hypoglycemic effect, presumably by increasing cytoplasmic AMP:ATP ratios, thereby activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). This kinase plays a central role in cellular energy homeostasis and affects glucose metabolism by modifying glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD1) and potentially other enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis. Metformin's transport into hepatic cells is primarily mediated by organic cation transporters such as SLC22A1 (OCT1), SLC22A2 (OCT2), and SLC22A3 (OCT3), along with its ejection through the multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins, SLC47A1 (MATE1) and SLC47A2 (MATE2). These transporters affect the pharmacokinetics of the drug, influencing its therapeutic effectiveness and side effects.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetics plays a significant role in metformin response variability among individuals. The efficacy and safety of metformin can be influenced by genetic variants in the SLC22A1 gene, encoding the OCT1 transporter responsible for hepatic uptake of the drug. Variants in this gene may alter transporter function, impacting metformin's pharmacokinetics and, consequently, its hypoglycemic effects. Moreover, genetic differences in the AMPK pathway, central to the drug's mechanism, may also modify therapeutic responses. While specific polymorphisms in these genes need further characterization for clinical application, they underline the importance of pharmacogenetics in personalizing metformin therapy. This approach can potentially optimize dosing strategies to enhance efficacy and minimize risks, especially considering metforminâ€™s narrow therapeutic index and the severe potential side effect of lactic acidosis.
