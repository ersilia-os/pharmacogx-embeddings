## Drug Summary
Teneligliptin is an antidiabetic medication used primarily in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. It belongs to the therapeutic class known as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. As is common with DPP-4 inhibitors, Teneligliptin enhances the levels of incretin hormones, which in turn increase insulin release and decrease glucagon production in a glucose-dependent manner. This modulation helps in the control of glycemic levels in diabetic patients. Specific details on its pharmacokinetics and metabolism are not directly provided in the DrugBank summary but, based on its class, Teneligliptin is likely metabolized in the liver and its action might be affected by renal and liver function.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The specific targets, metabolizing enzymes, transporters, and carriers of Teneligliptin are not described in the provided DrugBank summary. Generally, for DPP-4 inhibitors, the primary target is the enzyme DPP-4 itself, which is responsible for the inactivation of incretin hormones. These hormones play a crucial role in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Without detailed data, it is not possible to comment on specific enzymatic pathways or transport mechanisms involved in the metabolism and disposition of Teneligliptin.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is no pharmacogenetic data included in the provided information about Teneligliptin. However, pharmacogenetics could potentially play a role in the efficacy and safety of DPP-4 inhibitors, including Teneligliptin. Variations in genes encoding for the DPP-4 enzyme or related metabolic pathways could affect drug levels and patient responses. Additionally, genetic differences in the incretin-related pathways could theoretically influence individual responses to the drug. In clinical settings, pharmacogenetic testing is not routinely conducted for the administration of Teneligliptin, however, understanding genetic variability might help in personalizing treatments and predicting outcomes for patients with Type 2 Diabetes. Such associations would need to be validated in pharmacogenetic studies.
