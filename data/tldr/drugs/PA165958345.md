## Drug Summary
Nilotinib, known by its trade name Tasigna among others, is a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor specifically indicated for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Developed as a treatment option for patients showing resistance to earlier tyrosine kinase inhibitors like imatinib, nilotinib operates by obstructing specific signaling pathways crucial for tumor growth and cellular replication. Nilotinib selectively binds to and inhibits the activity of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, an abnormal enzyme found in CML patients. It has a higher affinity for binding to the ATP-binding site of BCR-ABL than imatinib which allows it to overcome resistance due to mutations. The initial clinical trials demonstrated significant therapeutic benefits, and its oral bioavailability makes it suitable for outpatient care settings.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Nilotinib's primary mechanism is the inhibition of the ABL1 tyrosine kinase, and it is also effective against the KIT tyrosine kinase. The drug demonstrates pharmacological activities against other receptors like c-Kit and PDGFRβ, which are implicated in other myeloproliferative disorders and some solid tumors. Nilotinib is metabolized predominantly by the liver enzyme CYP3A4, but also involves other cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP2B6. For transport, it significantly interacts with the P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and the BCRP transporter protein (ABCG2), which may affect its distribution and excretion. Furthermore, the transporter SLCO1B1 and the phase II metabolism enzyme UGT1A1 also have roles in the handling of nilotinib in the body.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of nilotinib is crucial for predicting therapy response and potential toxicities. Variations in CYP3A4, namely polymorphisms that affect the enzyme’s activity, can alter nilotinib metabolism, thus impacting both efficacy and safety. Patients with altered function of ABCB1 or ABCG2 might experience different drug levels due to changes in drug efflux, affecting both effectiveness and adverse reactions. A significant genetic marker associated with nilotinib involves UGT1A1; the presence of UGT1A1*28 allele (rs8175347) increases the risk of hyperbilirubinemia. This association necessitates genetic testing prior to therapy initiation to mitigate severe side effects and tailor treatment plans more effectively, highlighting the importance of personalized medicine in the context of nilotinib treatment.
