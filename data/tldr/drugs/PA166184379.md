## Drug Summary
Letermovir, marketed under the brand name Prevymis, was approved by the FDA in 2017 for the prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in adult recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) who are CMV-seropositive. It has also recently been approved for prophylaxis in adult kidney transplant recipients at risk for CMV disease. As the first of a new class of CMV anti-infectives known as DNA terminase complex inhibitors, Letermovir operates by impeding the activity of the CMV DNA terminase complex, which is crucial for the production and maturation of viral DNA and particle formation. The drug is characterized by a bioavailability of 94% in healthy subjects without cyclosporin, with food intake notably increasing Cmax. Metabolism occurs to a minor extent through UGT1A1/1A3, and the drug shows 35% bioavailability in HSCT recipients without cyclosporin. Toxicity studies indicate potential risks in pregnancy and fertility based on animal models, but human data is lacking.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Letermovir directly targets the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA terminase complex, comprised of subunits TRM1, TRM2, and TRM3. It particularly interferes with the production and maturation of viral DNA necessary for assembling viral particles. The exact binding nature isn’t fully understood, though resistance mutations in several of these subunits suggest a complex interaction that potentially affects several subunits simultaneously. Metabolism involves minor activity by enzymes UGT1A1 and UGT1A3, with several cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A43, CYP3A7, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6) potentially playing roles in the drug’s processing. Furthermore, transporters like SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3, in addition to others such as ABCB1, ABCG2, and ABCC2, are involved in its transport mechanisms across cellular barriers.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetics of Letermovir largely pertains to its metabolism and transport processes with significant implications from gene variants in UGT1A1/1A3 that affect drug metabolism. The involvement of multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes suggests a potential for variability in metabolic processing related to common polymorphisms in these genes, such as CYP3A5*3 or CYP2C19*2, which could affect drug levels and effectiveness. Moreover, transporters such as ABCB1 and ABCG2, known for variability due to genetic polymorphisms, imply possible differences in drug distribution and excretion among individuals. Such genetic differences can affect drug bioavailability, response, and potential toxicity. As for drug targets, while pharmacogenetic data specific to the interaction with CMV DNA terminase complex subunits is not detailed, genetic variability in viral targets could potentially impact therapeutic efficacy and resistance development, an area that might necessitate further genetic and clinical studies to hone personalized approaches in CMV management with Letermovir.
