## Drug Summary
Indomethacin, known under various brand names such as Indocid, Indocin, and others, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to treat moderate to severe instances of rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, bursitis, tendinitis, and acute gouty arthritis. It exhibits a strong analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. Discovered in 1963 and FDA-approved in 1965, indomethacin functions through non-selective inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, crucial in the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in inflammation, pain, and fever. It is also used intravenously in neonates to close a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus if other treatments fail. Available in various forms including oral capsules, rectal, and intravenous formulations, its use is, however, limited by risks such as gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side effects.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Indomethacin acts by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, which lead to decreased prostaglandin synthesis, key mediators of inflammation, pain, and fever. Indomethacin also inhibits other proteins such as PLA2G2A (Phospholipase A2, membrane-associated), PTGR2 (Prostaglandin reductase 2), and several others with roles in inflammatory pathways. The metabolization of the drug involves various enzymes such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and several UDP-glucuronosyltransferases like UGT1A9, UGT1A1, and UGT2B7. As for transport, indomethacin interacts with multiple transporters including ABCC3, ABCC4, ABCC6, and ABCB1, which affect the drug's bioavailability and excretion. The drug binds significantly to serum albumin (ALB), which can influence its distribution and efficacy.

## Pharmacogenetics
Indomethacin's pharmacogenetics involve polymorphisms in COX enzymes and various metabolizing enzymes. Variants of CYP2C9, a primary enzyme in its metabolic pathway, can alter indomethacin's clearance and thereby impact efficacy and toxicity. Individuals with certain CYP2C9 alleles might experience higher exposure to indomethacin, leading to an increased risk of adverse effects. Similarly, genetic variations in UGT enzymes may influence the glucuronidation of indomethacin, affecting drug levels and response. While specific transporter gene variants might affect the drug distribution, the detailed influence of these polymorphisms on therapy outcomes with indomethacin still requires more clinical validation. These pharmacogenomic factors could potentially guide personalized dosing to minimize risks while optimizing therapeutic effects.
