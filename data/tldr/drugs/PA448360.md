## Drug Summary
Amantadine, also known by brand names such as PK-Merz, Symadine, Viregyt, and Virosol, is an antiviral and antiparkinsonian agent. It primarily treats symptoms associated with influenza A, Parkinson's disease, and drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions. The medication is administered orally and is well-absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract. Despite its widespread absorption, amantadine undergoes minimal metabolism and thus has a relatively straightforward elimination process. Pharmacodynamically, amantadine enhances dopaminergic function which is thought to contribute to its effects in movement disorders, although the exact mechanisms remain poorly understood. It also has effects on norepinephrine and antagonizes NMDA receptors, contributing to its neurological activity.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Amantadine acts on multiple targets, including viral and human proteins. Its antiviral mechanism involves interference with the M2 matrix protein of Influenza A, inhibiting the uncoating process essential for viral replication. In humans, amantadine interacts with the Glutamate receptor ionotropic, NMDA 3A (GRIN3A), and several subunits of the neuronal acetylcholine receptors (CHRNA7, CHRNA4, CHRNA3). Additionally, it affects the Dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2), suggesting a role in modulating dopamine-related pathways critical to its antiparkinsonian activity. The drug impacts several transporters, including SLC22A2 and SLC22A1, which may influence its distribution and effects in bodily tissues. Its interaction with key enzymes like DDC and MAOB further suggests involvement in neurotransmitter synthesis and metabolism.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of amantadine have not been extensively detailed in the provided data and are not well-documented in the literature. However, given its interactions with systems like dopaminergic, cholinergic, and NMDA receptors, genetic variations in these pathways (e.g., polymorphisms in DRD2 or genes encoding NMDA subunits) could hypothetically influence individual responses to amantadine. The pharmaceutical response might vary significantly because of genetic differences in the drugâ€™s targets and transporters, such as variations in SLC22 family proteins that could affect drug absorption and distribution. Detailed pharmacogenomic studies would be needed to firmly establish these associations and guide personalized medicine approaches in using amantadine.
