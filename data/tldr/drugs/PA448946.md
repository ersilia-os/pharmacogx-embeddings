## Drug Summary
Chloroprocaine, also known under brand names such as Iheezo, Nesacaine-CE, and Piocaine, is an ester local anesthetic agent. It is commonly used in its hydrochloride salt form and primarily indicated for producing local or regional anesthesia. Chloroprocaine functions by stabilizing the neuronal membrane which blocks the initiation and conduction of nerve impulses, thereby producing a reversible blockade of nerve conduction. The drug has a fast onset (6 to 12 minutes) and a short duration of action (up to 60 minutes). The presence of epinephrine in the formulation can alter its absorption and plasma concentration, further reducing its systemic toxicity. Chloroprocaine is metabolized rapidly by pseudocholinesterases in the plasma and nonspecific esterases in ocular tissues. 

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The main mechanism of action of chloroprocaine involves inhibition of signal conduction along nerves by binding predominantly to a series of voltage-gated sodium channels, which include alpha subunits like SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN3A, SCN4A, SCN5A, SCN7A, SCN8A, SCN9A, SCN10A, and SCN11A. These channels play pivotal roles in the generation and conduction of action potentials in neurons. Additionally, chloroprocaine is shown to interact with SLC6A3, a sodium-dependent dopamine transporter. For its metabolic breakdown, chloroprocaine is primarily hydrolyzed by butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE), an enzyme responsible for the cleavage of ester linkages in its structure.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of chloroprocaine predominantly revolves around the activity of BCHE. Variants in the BCHE gene could potentially influence the rate of metabolism of chloroprocaine, thereby impacting both the efficacy and duration of anesthesia, as well as the propensity for adverse drug reactions. For example, individuals with atypical or less active variants of BCHE might exhibit prolonged duration of action or increased systemic concentrations of chloroprocaine, which could lead to higher toxicity risks. Although specific pharmacogenetic guidelines for chloroprocaine have not been established, these genetic variations can be critical in clinical settings, especially in precision medicine where tailored dosages might be necessary. Further pharmacogenomic studies could be beneficial in elucidating more detailed interactions and genetic predispositions affecting chloroprocaine's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
