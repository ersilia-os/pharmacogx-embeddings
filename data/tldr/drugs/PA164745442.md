## Drug Summary
Phenoxymethylpenicillin, known widely as Penicillin V or Penicillin VK, is a narrow-spectrum antibiotic and a phenoxymethyl analog of Penicillin G (benzylpenicillin). It is predominantly used to treat mild to moderate infections particularly of the respiratory tract, skin, and soft tissues caused by Penicillin G-sensitive organisms. Additionally, it is administered as a prophylactic agent against bacterial endocarditis in susceptible individuals undergoing dental or upper respiratory tract surgeries. Phenoxymethylpenicillin functions by targeting bacterial cell wall synthesis, ultimately causing cell lysis. Absorption of the drug is rapid but incomplete with a bioavailability between 25 to 60%. Metabolism predominantly results in penicilloic acid, an inactive form, and the antimicrobial effects show clinical implications in therapeutic uses against a range of susceptible bacterial pathogens.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Phenoxymethylpenicillin acts by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which are crucial for bacterial cell wall synthesis. Specific targets include mecA (PBP2' specific to Staphylococcus aureus), pbpA (Penicillin-binding protein 1A in Clostridium perfringens), and dacB (D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase DacB in Escherichia coli). Another target is Penicillin acylase from Lysinibacillus sphaericus. Additionally, Solute carrier family 15 member 1 (SLC15A1) in humans is identified as a carrier, facilitating the cellular uptake of the drug. There are no specific enzymes or transporters detailed for the metabolism and transport processes of Phenoxymethylpenicillin according to available data.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetics considerations for phenoxymethylpenicillin are less documented compared to other drugs, but general penicillin-related genetics could apply. One of the primary concerns in phenoxymethylpenicillin therapy is hypersensitivity reactions, which could be influenced by genetic predispositions in the immune response genes. Moreover, variations in the SLC15A1 gene could potentially influence the absorption and serum levels of the drug, impacting efficacy and toxicity. Further studies and clinical genetic testing might provide more insights into the pharmacogenetics implications specific to phenoxymethylpenicillin and its analogs.
