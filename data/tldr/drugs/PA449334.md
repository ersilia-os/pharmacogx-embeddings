## Drug Summary
Diltiazem is a benzothiazepine derivative widely used for its antihypertensive, anti-arrhythmic, and vasodilating properties, and it belongs to the non-dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers. Approved by the FDA in 1982, it works by inhibiting the influx of calcium ions into cardiac and vascular smooth muscles during depolarization, which leads to relaxation of these muscles and decrease in blood pressure. Diltiazem is indicated for the management of hypertension, chronic stable angina, variant angina, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias. It has also found off-label use in conditions like anal fissures and migraine prophylaxis. Diltiazem is primarily metabolized by the liver, exhibiting extensive first-pass metabolism, and it is available in various oral and intravenous formulations.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Diltiazem acts on various molecular targets, primarily inhibiting L-type calcium channels by binding to the alpha-1C subunit (CACNA1C), which leads to decreased myocardial contraction and lowered blood pressure. It also involves other calcium channel-related proteins like the gamma-1 subunit (CACNG1). Metabolism of diltiazem is significantly mediated via cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2C8, contributing to its biotransformation into active metabolites. The transporter protein P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) also interacts with diltiazem, affecting its cellular uptake and distribution. Additionally, diltiazem binds to serum proteins such as albumin (ALB) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (ORM1), influencing its pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors significantly affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of diltiazem. Variations in the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 genes can influence the metabolic rate of diltiazem, leading to differences in drug levels and responses among individuals. Genetic polymorphisms in the transporter gene ABCB1 could alter the efficacy and side effect profile of diltiazem. According to genomic data, patients with the ADRB1 gene polymorphism (rs1801253) may require lower dosages of diltiazem to achieve effective heart rate control in the treatment of atrial fibrillation, underscoring the need for personalized dosing in specific subpopulations. This highlights the importance of considering genetic makeup when prescribing diltiazem to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects.
