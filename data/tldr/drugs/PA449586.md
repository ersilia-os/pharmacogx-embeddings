## Drug Summary
Famotidine is a histamine-2 (H<sub>2</sub>) receptor antagonist, effectively inhibiting gastric acid secretion, which makes it useful for treating conditions like gastric ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It displays significantly higher potency compared to other H<sub>2</sub> blockers such as cimetidine and ranitidine. Indications include management of duodenal and gastric ulcers, GERD, erosive esophagitis, and conditions like Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome. Famotidine is available in both oral and intravenous formulations, the latter of which is used in hospital settings or when oral intake is not possible. Its pharmacokinetics reveals a dose-dependent absorption with oral bioavailability ranging between 40-50%, and its action commencement occurs within one hour, peaking between 1-3 hours. This drug experiences minimal first-pass metabolism, primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Famotidine’s primary mechanism is the competitive inhibition of the H<sub>2</sub> receptor (HRH2), which is integral to the regulation of gastric acid secretion in the stomach. Besides its primary target, Famotidine is metabolized minimally by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP1A2, although this pathway is not majorly contributive to its clearance. However, famotidine interactions with transporters are notable; it is a substrate for several renal organic ion transporters including SLC22A6 (OAT1), SLC22A8 (OAT3), SLC22A2 (OCT2), and SLC47A1 (MATE1). These transporters assist in the renal excretion of the drug. No significant activity with carriers is noted.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic data on famotidine primarily highlight the role of its metabolism and transport processes that may be affected by genetic variation. Variants in CYP1A2 may influence the minimal metabolic pathway of famotidine, though given the limited role of metabolism in the drug's pharmacokinetics, significant clinical impacts are questionable and need further verification. More pertinently, variations in genes encoding for its identified transporters (SLC22A6, SLC22A8, SLC22A2, and SLC47A1) could affect the drug’s renal clearance, potentially altering its efficacy or toxicity profiles in individuals having different alleles of these transporter genes. However, conclusive evidence linking these genetic variations to clinical outcomes in famotidine treatment appears limited and suggests an area ripe for further genetic association studies and personalized medicine research.
