## Drug Summary
Tolbutamide, known by various brand names such as Artosin, Orinase, and Rastinon, is a first-generation sulfonylurea antidiabetic agent used primarily for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), in conjunction with diet and exercise. It operates by enhancing insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells and improving the efficiency of the body's insulin use. Tolbutamide is quickly absorbed after oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations observed within 3-5 hours. It is metabolized mainly in the liver, primarily through oxidation, and excreted in urine and feces. As a sulfonylurea, it is associated with risks such as hypoglycemia, particularly in special populations like the elderly or malnourished.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Tolbutamide acts on sulfonylurea receptors such as ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 8 (ABCC8) and ATP-sensitive inward rectifier potassium channel 1 (KCNJ1), which regulates insulin release via ionic mechanisms involving ATP-potassium channels in pancreatic β cells. It is metabolized by several cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, and CYP2C18, which underscore its hepatic clearance. Tolbutamide interaction with transporters such as SLC15A1, SLCO1A2, SLC22A6, SLC15A2, and SLCO2B1 influences its absorption and elimination processes. It also binds to carriers like serum albumin (ALB), affecting its distribution within the body.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic considerations are particularly important for tolbutamide due to its metabolism by CYP2C9, which exhibits genetic variability that can affect drug efficacy and safety. The genotype rs1057910 in CYP2C9 can lead to reduced metabolism of tolbutamide, impacting drug levels and increasing the risk of prolonged hypoglycemia. This genetic association highlights the need for personalized dosing and heightened vigilance in populations with this genotype to mitigate potential adverse effects. Such pharmacogenetic information is crucial for optimizing therapeutic outcomes and minimizing risks in patients treated with tolbutamide for diabetes management.
