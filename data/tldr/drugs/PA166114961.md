## Drug Summary
Dolutegravir is an antiretroviral medication used primarily in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. It belongs to the class of drugs known as HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), which block the integration of the viral genome into the human DNA, a critical step in the viral replication process. Dolutegravir was developed by ViiV Healthcare and approved by the FDA in 2013. It is usually prescribed in combination with other antiretrovirals. Dolutegravir shows rapid and potent antiviral activity with a high barrier to resistance due to its tight binding and longer dissociative half-life. Its absorption shows peak plasma concentrations between 2 to 3 hours post-dose, with steady-state reached within about 5 days. Metabolically, it is processed through glucuronidation by UGT1A1, carbon oxidation by CYP3A4, and defluorination followed by glutathione conjugation.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Dolutegravir specifically targets the HIV-1 integrase enzyme (pol gene), crucial for the viral replication cycle. It possesses a high binding affinity which disrupts the DNA integration process, a unique antiretroviral mechanism exclusive to INSTIs. The drug is primarily metabolized by UGT1A1 and the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4 along with minor contributions from UGT1A3, UGT1A9, CYP3A43, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7. Several transporters including SLC22A2, ABCG2, SLC22A6, SLC22A8, ABCB1, and SLC47A1 are involved in its pharmacokinetics, influencing its distribution and excretion. Albumin (ALB) and alpha1-acid glycoprotein (ORM2) are known carriers that may affect its transport and bioavailability in the bloodstream.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of Dolutegravir is significantly influenced by polymorphisms in the UGT1A1 gene, which is critical for the drug's glucuronidation pathway. Variants such as rs8175347 and rs4148323 in UGT1A1 are associated with reduced metabolism of Dolutegravir, potentially leading to higher plasma concentrations and extended drug action, which may necessitate dosage adjustments. This genetic variability can affect the drug's efficacy and safety profile, indicating a need for personalized medication strategies based on the patientâ€™s genetic makeup. Patients with these variants might be classified as poor metabolizers, and thus, could be at risk for increased drug exposure and potential toxicity. Such pharmacogenetic information may guide clinicians in optimizing antiretroviral therapy for better therapeutic outcomes and minimal adverse effects.
