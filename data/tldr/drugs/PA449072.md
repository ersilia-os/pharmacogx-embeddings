## Drug Summary
Cocaine is an alkaloid ester derived from the leaves of coca plants. It functions both as a powerful central nervous system stimulant and a local anesthetic. Cocaine is unique among local anesthetics for its vasoconstrictive properties, making it useful clinically, particularly in ophthalmic, otolaryngological, and dental procedures where local (topical) anesthesia of mucous membranes is required. The drug's stimulant effects are similar to those of amphetamines, which contributes to its high potential for abuse. Pharmacodynamically, cocaine inhibits the reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, enhancing their neurotransmitter activity in the brain. It is absorbed efficiently through mucosal and gastrointestinal routes, with a bioavailability ranging from 60 to 80%. Metabolism occurs primarily in the liver, producing metabolites like benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester, largely excreted in urine. The presence of alcohol can lead to the formation of a more toxic metabolite, cocaethylene.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Cocaine interacts with a variety of molecular targets including multiple sodium channel proteins (e.g., SCN1A, SCN2A, and up to SCN9A) and transport proteins such as the sodium-dependent dopamine (SLC6A3), noradrenaline (SLC6A2), and serotonin (SLC6A4) transporters, which play key roles in its mechanism of action related to neurotransmitter reuptake inhibition. These interactions underlie both its anesthetic and euphoric properties. Important enzymes in cocaine metabolism include CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP2C8, as well as liver carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) and cholinesterase (BCHE), which are responsible for its biotransformation into less active compounds. The SLC22A2 transporter also participates in its physiological transport processes, while ORM2 acts as a carrier protein in the plasma.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetics plays a significant role in the variability of responses and risks associated with cocaine use. Variants in genes encoding its metabolic enzymes, particularly CYP450 enzymes like CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, can influence the rate of cocaine metabolism, potentially affecting both efficacy and toxicity. Moreover, genetic variations in the dopamine transporter gene (SLC6A3) could influence susceptibility to cocaine dependence and addiction, as this transporter is a crucial component in dopamine reuptake inhibition, a central mechanism underlying the drug's addictive properties. While specific pharmacogenetic data from genomic studies were not provided, these gene-drug interactions indicate potential areas for pharmacogenetic research and implications in clinical and forensic settings.
