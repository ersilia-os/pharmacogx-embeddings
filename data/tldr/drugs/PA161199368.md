## Drug Summary
Iloperidone, known by brand names such as Fanapta, Fiapta, and Zomaril, is an atypical antipsychotic drug approved for the treatment of schizophrenia. The drug was developed through various partnerships, eventually gaining FDA approval in May 2009. Iloperidone primarily acts as a neuroleptic agent due to its antagonistic effects on dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, which are critical in managing symptoms of schizophrenia. Pharmacodynamically, iloperidone has a high affinity for Î± adrenergic receptors along with moderate to high affinities for several dopamine and serotonin receptor subtypes. This leads to improvements in cognition and psychotic symptoms. The absorption of iloperidone is efficient, with maximum plasma concentrations occurring 2-4 hours post-administration, and steady-state concentrations are achieved within 3-4 days. It is primarily metabolized in the liver mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme systems, producing metabolites that vary in their receptor affinities.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Iloperidone interacts with a range of receptor targets that include dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD1, DRD3, DRD4), serotonin receptors (HTR2A, HTR1A, HTR6, HTR7), and adrenergic receptors (ADRA1A, ADRA2C), along with the histamine receptor HRH1. This diverse receptor binding profile contributes to its therapeutic effects as well as side effects. The drug's metabolism involves several cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, CYP2E1, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are responsible for various oxidative processes crucial for iloperidone's metabolic clearance. The metabolism of iloperidone leads to the formation of several metabolites, among which P95 and P88 are major ones having varying affinities for serotonin and adrenergic receptors. No specific transporters or carriers are noted for iloperidone.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of iloperidone revolves mostly around its metabolism mediated by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Variability in these genes can influence the drug's plasma levels and, consequently, its efficacy and side-effect profile. Individuals with different CYP2D6 phenotypes (poor, intermediate, extensive, or ultrarapid metabolizers) may require dosage adjustments. There is evidence suggesting that adverse effects like QTc prolongation are more pronounced in poor metabolizers due to higher plasma concentrations of iloperidone. Moreover, genetic variations in CYP3A5 and CYP3A7 could also modulate metabolic rates, though these are generally less explored in clinical contexts compared to CYP2D6. There is, as of now, limited direct genomic data provided for iloperidone concerning other potential pharmacogenomic interactions that could impact a broader receptor target perspective or patient-based genetic predispositions beyond metabolic enzymes.
