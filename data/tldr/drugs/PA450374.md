## Drug Summary
Methylphenobarbital, also known by various brand names such as Mephyltaletten, Phemiton, and Prominal, is a barbiturate primarily used for its anticonvulsant and anxiolytic properties. It is indicated for the relief of anxiety, tension, and apprehension, and is also employed in the treatment of epilepsy. Methylphenobarbital is converted in the liver to phenobarbital, another well-known anticonvulsant. The pharmacodynamics of methylphenobarbital involve acting as a nonselective depressant of the central nervous system (CNS), affecting all levels of CNS activity from excitement to deep coma. This drug has sedative and relaxant effects and can be used to manage tension headaches, migraines, and pain in combination with other agents like acetaminophen or aspirin and caffeine. It binds to a site on the GABA_A receptor, prolonging the effect of GABA and thereby increasing neuronal inhibition. Around 50% of an oral dose is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and about 75% of it is converted to phenobarbital within 24 hours.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Methylphenobarbital influences several targets, primarily within the CNS. Its action on various subunits of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABRA1, GABRA2, GABRA3, GABRA4, GABRA5, GABRA6) enhances GABA-induced chloride ion influx, leading to hyperpolarization and inhibition of neuronal firing. Additionally, it affects neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunits (CHRNA4 and CHRNA7) and ionotropic glutamate receptors (GRIK2, GRIA2), which could contribute to its CNS effects. The drug's metabolism involves cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP2C19 and CYP2B6, which play roles in its conversion to phenobarbital. No specific transporters or carriers are noted for this drug.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of methylphenobarbital is influenced by its metabolism involving cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2C19 and CYP2B6. Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2C19 can lead to variable metabolism rates, impacting therapeutic efficacy and risk of toxicity. Poor metabolizers may exhibit increased plasma levels leading to toxicity, while rapid metabolizers might require higher doses for efficacy. Similarly, CYP2B6 polymorphisms might alter drug levels and response. No specific transporter or receptor gene polymorphisms are directly linked with its pharmacokinetic properties, though variations in GABA receptors and other CNS targets could theoretically affect its pharmacodynamics and individual responses to treatment. These pharmacogenetic considerations underscore the importance of personalized dosing and monitoring for effective and safe use of methylphenobarbital in clinical settings.
