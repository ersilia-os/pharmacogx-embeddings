## Drug Summary
Tenofovir is an acyclic nucleotide diester analog of adenosine monophosphate, classified as a nucleotide analog due to the presence of a phosphate group. Marketed as tenofovir disoproxil and tenofovir alafenamide for enhanced oral bioavailability, it was first reported for its antiviral activities in 1993 and became commercially available in 2008. Tenofovir shows efficacy against HIV, herpes simplex virus-2, and hepatitis B virus, with notable effectiveness in HIV patients naive to antiretroviral therapy. It acts by undergoing bi-phosphorylation to become active and inhibits viral reverse transcriptase, leading to chain termination and inhibition of viral DNA synthesis. Tenofovir is known for its safety profile due to low affinity for cellular DNA polymerases, including mitochondrial types.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Tenofovir primarily targets viral enzymes such as HIV-1's reverse transcriptase/RNaseH and HBV's reverse transcriptase, effectively inhibiting these viruses by terminating their DNA chains. It also affects DNA polymerase in herpes simplex virus-2, further showcasing its broad antiviral capabilities. Key enzymes involved in its activation include NME1 and NME2 (nucleoside diphosphate kinases), as well as adenylate kinases AK1 and AK2, crucial for the bi-phosphorylation process. Tenofovir's transport across cells is mediated by transporters such as ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1) and various SLC family members, which could influence its pharmacokinetics. Its interaction with the carrier protein ALB (serum albumin) may also affect its distribution and efficacy.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetics data specific to tenofovir are limited, but existing knowledge of the enzymes and transporters involved in its pharmacokinetics suggests potential genetic influence. Variants in genes encoding for enzymes like NME1 and NME2 or transport proteins such as ABCB1, SLC22A6, and SLC22A8 could alter the drug's activation, transport, and clearance, thus affecting individual responses to therapy and susceptibility to side effects. For instance, polymorphisms in ABCB1 have been associated with differences in drug transport and efficacy in other antiretroviral drugs, which might extrapolate to tenofovir. Further research could provide deeper insights into these associations, potentially leading to more personalized and effective use of tenofovir based on genetic profiles.
