## Drug Summary
Propofol, known under various brand names like Disoprivan and Fresofol, is an intravenous anesthetic widely used for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia as well as sedation for medical procedures. It facilitates rapid onset of anesthesia, typically within seconds, and offers a relatively quick recovery when compared to other agents such as thiopental or etomidate. Its pharmacodynamic effect is primarily through potentiation of the neurotransmitter GABA at the GABA-A receptors, enhancing inhibitory effects which result in sedation and hypnosis. Metabolically, propofol is primarily cleared by the liver through glucuronidation and hydroxylation, with enzymes such as CYP2B6 and CYP2C9 playing roles in its transformation.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Propofol acts mainly on various subunits of GABA-A receptors including GABRA1, GABRA2, GABRA3, GABRA4, GABRA5, GABRA6, GABRB1, GABRB2, and GABRB3, enhancing the GABAergic inhibition in the central nervous system. It also appears to interact with sodium channels (SCN4A, SCN2A), although the clinical significance of this is less clear. Regarding its metabolism, key enzymes include CYP2C9 and CYP2B6, and multiple isoforms of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) such as UGT1A1, UGT1A6, UGT1A8, and UGT1A9. Propofol is also a substrate for the transporter P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1) and binds to serum albumin (ALB), which can affect its pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic associations of propofol are primarily linked to variations in the genes encoding the metabolizing enzymes CYP2B6 and CYP2C9. Individuals with certain genetic variants in these enzymes may experience altered pharmacokinetics of propofol, affecting drug clearance and potentially leading to variability in response and risk of adverse effects. Polymorphisms in the gene UGT1A9 have also been suggested to influence the glucuronidation of propofol, thereby affecting its elimination and overall sedative effects. Genetic variations in targets like GABA-A receptor subunits could theoretically influence sensitivity to propofol, although specific associations in clinical settings are not well-documented and require further investigation. The transporter gene ABCB1 might also modulate propofol's distribution and elimination, contributing to inter-individual variability in drug exposure and response.
