## Drug Summary
Acetaminophen, also known widely under the brand name Tylenol among others, is an analgesic and antipyretic medication recommended by the World Health Organization for pain conditions and fever reduction. It does not belong to the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) class as it lacks anti-inflammatory properties. The drug's mechanism of action is primarily via inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2), with speculative action on COX-3, affecting prostaglandin synthesis which modulates pain and thermoregulation. Acetaminophen was first approved by the FDA in 1951 and is available in various forms, including tablets, syrups, injections, and suppositories. It has high oral bioavailability (88%) and is mostly metabolized in the liver via conjugation and a minor pathway that produces a toxic metabolite in overdose situations.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Acetaminophen targets several enzymes: PTGS1 (COX-1), PTGS2 (COX-2), PTGES3 involving prostaglandin synthesis, and TRPV1, a receptor potential cation channel in pain perception. The drug is metabolized primarily in the liver through pathways involving enzymes such as CYP2E1, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2A6, UGT1A6, UGT1A1, UGT1A9, UGT2B15, SULT1A1, SULT1A3/1A4, NAT2, FAAH, GSTP1, and GSTM1. The prominent transporter involved with acetaminophen is ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), and the main carrier protein is ALB (Serum albumin).

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of acetaminophen predominantly involve its metabolism. Variabilities in genes encoding enzymes like CYP2E1 can influence the extent of production of toxic metabolites, particularly NAPQI, leading to varying risks of liver toxicity among individuals. For instance, polymorphisms in CYP2E1 might affect the rate of NAPQI production during overdose, impacting the risk and severity of hepatotoxicity. Moreover, genetic variants in glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1, GSTM1) may influence the detoxification of NAPQI, further contributing to differential susceptibility to liver damage. The pharmacogenomic responses need careful consideration, especially in overdose management, emphasizing personalized approaches towards dosing and treatment based on genetic predispositions.
