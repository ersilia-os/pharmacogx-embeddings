## Drug Summary
Trifluoperazine, also known under various other names including Eskazine and Stelazine, belongs to the therapeutic class of phenothiazines, which are widely used as antipsychotic agents. This drug is specifically utilized for the treatment of anxiety disorders, depressive symptoms secondary to anxiety, agitation, and prominently for schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Pharmacodynamically, Trifluoperazine acts primarily by blocking the dopaminergic D2 receptors in the brain, influencing multiple systems such as the hypothalamic and hypophyseal hormones, and the reticular activating system, which controls functions like basal metabolism, body temperature, and emesis. The absorption details are unspecified, but it is metabolized hepatically.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Trifluoperazine interacts with various targets, enzymes, and transporters, having broad implications in its effect and metabolism. Significant targets include the Dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2), which is key in its antipsychotic action, and the Alpha-1A adrenergic receptor (ADRA1A), affecting cardiovascular responses. Other noteworthy targets are Neuron-specific vesicular protein calcyon (CALY), Calmodulin (CALM1), Troponin C (TNNC1), and Protein S100-A4 (S100A4), suggesting implications on neurological and muscle function. Key enzymes involved in its metabolism include Xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase (XDH), UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-4 (UGT1A4), and Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2), impacting drug clearance and potential interactions. Transport-wise, Trifluoperazine is a substrate for P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), which could influence its distribution and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of Trifluoperazine is particularly relevant for its metabolism and transport mechanisms. Variants in CYP1A2 may affect its metabolic rate, impacting both efficacy and toxicity of the drug. For instance, individuals with certain polymorphisms in the CYP1A2 gene could have slower metabolism leading to higher exposure and potentially more severe side effects. Similarly, genetic variations in ABCB1 might influence the drug's distribution and excretion, modifying therapeutic outcomes and side-effect profiles. While specific genomic data from the provided source is not available, leveraging resources such as PharmGKB or clinical studies could provide more precise insights into these interactions, helping tailor treatments to individual genetic profiles to optimize effectiveness and minimize adverse effects.
