## Drug Summary
Entrectinib is a small molecule inhibitor primarily targeting tropomyosin receptor tyrosine kinases (TRKs) including TRKA (NTRK1), TRKB (NTRK2), and TRKC (NTRK3), as well as proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ROS1 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). It competitively inhibits these kinases by mimicking ATP binding. Entrectinib was approved by the FDA in 2019 for the treatment of ROS1-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and for NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumors. It is typically indicated as a last line of therapy due to its accelerated approval based on preliminary clinical data. Entrectinib absorbs into the body with a peak concentration time (Tmax) of 4-5 hours post-administration, and its primary metabolism pathway involves CYP3A4, which is responsible for converting it into an active metabolite M5 and other in vivo metabolites.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Entrectinib actively inhibits multiple targets involved in cell proliferation and survival pathways. These include NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3, ROS1, and JAK2, all of which are critical in various growth factor-mediated signaling pathways. The inhibition of these kinases interferes with downstream signaling pathways such as MAPK, PI3K, PLC-Î³, and JAK/STAT, promoting apoptosis and reducing tumor growth. Entrectinib is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4. Among the transporters, P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1) has been identified as involved in its transport. No specific carriers have been listed in the provided drug information.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of entrectinib is strongly influenced by mutations or gene fusions in its target genes (NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3, ROS1). The effectiveness of entrectinib is significantly higher in cancers expressing these genetic alterations. Moreover, variations in CYP3A4 activity can alter the pharmacokinetics of entrectinib, impacting its metabolism and subsequently its efficacy and toxicity. Patients with polymorphisms that result in reduced CYP3A4 activity might experience higher levels of the drug, potentially leading to increased adverse effects. Conversely, those with polymorphisms leading to increased CYP3A4 activity could have reduced drug levels and decreased efficacy. The reliance on ABCB1 for transport could also be influenced by genetic variants in the ABCB1 gene that might affect the drug's distribution and elimination. Therefore, understanding the specific genetic context of patients could guide more personalized dosing and therapeutic strategies for using entrectinib.
