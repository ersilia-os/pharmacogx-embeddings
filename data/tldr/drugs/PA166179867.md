## Drug Summary
Binimetinib, marketed as Mektovi, is an oral, selective small molecule inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases 1 and 2 (MEK1/2). It is used in combination with encorafenib (Braftovi) for treating unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations, as well as metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with BRAF V600E mutation. This drug works by noncompetitively binding to MEK1 and MEK2, inhibiting their activity which prevents activation of MEK-dependent proteins and transcription factors in the ERK pathway. This interruption of the downstream signaling pathways results in inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and reduction in inflammatory cytokine production. Pharmacokinetically, binimetinib shows dose-proportional systemic exposure with a bioavailability of at least 50% and achieves peak plasma concentrations around 1.6 hours after oral administration.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Binimetinib targets MEK1 and MEK2 - essential components of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, frequently activated in tumors. It has a range of metabolic pathways with principal metabolism via glucuronidation primarily by UGT1A1. Oxidative metabolism occurs through CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. Known transporters interacting with binimetinib include ABCG2 and ABCB1, which could influence its distribution and elimination. Furthermore, it binds highly (97%) to plasma proteins, with serum albumin (ALB) being a significant carrier. This extensive plasma protein binding suggests that methods like hemodialysis might not be effective for overdose management.

## Pharmacogenetics
In terms of pharmacogenetics, binimetinibâ€™s therapeutic effectiveness and safety can be influenced by genetic variants shaping drug metabolism and transport pathways. Variants in UGT1A1 could impact the glucuronidation and subsequent clearance of binimetinib, potentially altering its efficacy and toxicity profile. Similarly, polymorphisms in CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 might influence the rate of drug metabolism. Pharmacogenetic testing for mutations in the BRAF gene (V600E or V600K) is essential to identify eligible patients for treatment. Although not directly linked to pharmacogenetics, transporter genes like ABCB1 and ABCG2 might also vary among individuals and affect drug disposition. There is less evidence directly tying genomic variants with clinical outcomes for binimetinib specifically, but these interactions can potentially guide individualized therapeutic strategies and optimize patient responses.
