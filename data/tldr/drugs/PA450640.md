## Drug Summary
Nitrofurantoin is a nitrofuran antibiotic primarily used for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is known under various brand names including Furabid, Niftran, Siraliden, Urantoin, and Urolong. This antibiotic works by being converted by bacterial nitroreductases into reactive intermediates that disrupt multiple cellular processes such as the citric acid cycle, and the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein. This multi-target mechanism contributes to its lower propensity for developing bacterial resistance compared to other antibiotics. Nitrofurantoin was first approved by the FDA in 1953. It is remarkably effective at achieving therapeutic levels in the urinary tract, owing to its rapid absorption and excretion dynamics. Its bioavailability ranges from 38.8% to 44.3%, and can be enhanced by food intake which improves its absorption and prolongs its urinary concentrations.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Nitrofurantoin targets several bacterial proteins within Escherichia coli (strain K12), disrupting essential processes: 'ydbK', a probable pyruvate-flavodoxin oxidoreductase which plays a role in metabolic processes; 'nfsA', an oxygen-insensitive NADPH nitroreductase involved in electron transport; and 'rpsJ', which is a component of the 30S ribosomal subunit affecting protein synthesis. In humans, the drug is metabolized in small amounts, with human NADPH--cytochrome P450 reductase (POR) identified as an enzyme involved in its metabolic process. Specifically, transport proteins like ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2), ABCB11 (Bile salt export pump), ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), and ABCC2 (Canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter 1) influence its transport and distribution within the body, impacting its pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
While the provided data does not contain specific pharmacogenomic relationships with nitrofurantoin, several transporters mentioned (such as ABCG2, ABCB11, ABCB1, and ABCC2) are known to be influenced by genetic polymorphisms, which could potentially impact the drug’s transport and efficacy. For instance, variants in the ABCG2 gene can affect drug efflux from cells, altering drug levels and responses. Similarly, ABCB1 polymorphisms have been linked to variations in drug disposition for various drugs. In the realm of nitrofurantoin’s pharmacogenetics, assessing genetic variations in these transporters could inform personalized therapeutic strategies, particularly for maximizing efficacy and minimizing adverse effects in treating UTIs. There remains, however, a need for more direct studies linking specific genetic profiles to patient outcomes with nitrofurantoin treatment.
