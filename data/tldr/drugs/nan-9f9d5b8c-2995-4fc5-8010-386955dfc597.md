## Drug Summary
Artenimol, also known as dihydroartemisinin, is an artemisinin derivative extensively used as an antimalarial agent. It is specifically indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated *Plasmodium falciparum* infections. Artenimol is typically administered in combination with other antimalarial drugs, such as piperaquine (found in the combination therapy Eurartesim), enhancing efficacy and reducing the risk of resistance development. The drug displays a mechanism of action characterized by forming a reactive carbon radical intermediate, which is effective in killing the malaria parasite through alkylation of various proteins. Artenimol exhibits an oral bioavailability of about 45% in healthy adults, but this can increase in malaria-infected patients, possibly due to altered metabolism or drug accumulation in infected erythrocytes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Artenimol targets several proteins within both human cells and the *Plasmodium falciparum* parasite. Key targets include actin, various annexins, ATP synthases, and several ribonucleoproteins and kinases within humans. In the parasite, it targets vital proteins like serca (P-type Ca2+-transporting ATPase), which is crucial for the parasite's survival, contributing significantly to its antimalarial effects. Artenimol is metabolized predominantly by the enzymes UGT1A9 and UGT2B7, with minor contributions from CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. There are no significant interactions involving specific transporters or carriers listed for Artenimol, focusing its action and metabolism mostly on enzyme interactions.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors influencing Artenimol's efficacy and safety primarily involve its metabolic enzymes. Genetic variants in UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 could alter the pharmacokinetics of Artenimol, potentially impacting its therapeutic effectiveness and side effect profile. Variants in CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 might also modify the drug's metabolism, but their clinical significance in the context of Artenimol metabolism is less clear. Given the variations in these enzymes among different populations, genetic testing might inform optimal dosing or the risk of adverse effects, although current clinical guidelines for Artenimol do not typically include pharmacogenetic testing. Further research could elucidate more details regarding the impact of genetic variations on the treatment outcomes with Artenimol in malaria.
