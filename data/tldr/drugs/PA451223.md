## Drug Summary
Ramipril, known under various brand names such as Acovil, Cardace, and Tritace, is a prominent member of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors class used primarily for cardiovascular management. Ramipril is a prodrug metabolized primarily in the liver (and to a lesser extent in the kidneys) into its active form, ramiprilat, which inhibits ACE, thereby reducing the production of angiotensin II. This decrease leads to vasodilation and reduced blood pressure, making ramipril beneficial in treating hypertension, heart failure, and improving survival post-myocardial infarction. Its pharmacokinetics involves at least 50-60% absorption, with food affecting the rate but not the extent of absorption. The drug has a bioavailability of 28% for ramipril and 44% for ramiprilat.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Ramipril primarily targets ACE, inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which significantly impacts blood pressure control and electrolyte balance. Another target is the B1 bradykinin receptor (BDKRB1), which potentially contributes to the vasodilatory effects seen with ACE inhibitors and may explain the side effect of dry cough associated with these drugs. The drug's metabolism is facilitated by liver esterases (mainly BCHE) and its active metabolite, ramiprilat, exhibits higher elevations in patients due to this metabolic pathway. Ramipril and ramiprilat are transported mainly by the solute carrier family members SLC15A1 and SLC15A2, which might influence the drugâ€™s absorption and disposition in the body.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic studies have shown that genotypic variations in the ACE gene can influence the response to ramipril. Notably, individuals carrying specific alleles (e.g., rs4344 genotype) may experience quicker blood pressure reductions with ramipril treatment. This hints at the potential need for genotype-based dosing or selection of antihypertensive therapy to optimize treatment efficacy and minimize side effects. This genetic association underscores the role of pharmacogenetic testing in personalizing treatment with ramipril, though further studies are needed to expand on these findings and potentially incorporate them into clinical practice.
