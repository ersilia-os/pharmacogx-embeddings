## Drug Summary
Aliskiren is a renin inhibitor, the first in its class, specifically used for the management of hypertension. Approved by the FDA in 2007, aliskiren can be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications like calcium channel blockers and thiazides to enhance blood pressure control. The pharmacokinetics of aliskiren reveal a low bioavailability of 2-2.5%, with peak plasma concentrations attained 1-3 hours post-administration. It achieves steady-state within 7-8 days when administered regularly. Pharmacodynamically, aliskiren functions by binding to and inhibiting renin, an enzyme crucial in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). This inhibition prevents the cascade of events that lead to the production of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor, thus reducing overall blood pressure and associated cardiovascular risks.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Aliskiren directly targets and inhibits the enzyme renin (gene symbol: REN), which plays a central role in the RAAS by initiating the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. This drug is metabolized to a limited extent, with about 80% remaining unchanged in plasma; minor metabolites include an O-demethylated alcohol derivative and a carboxylic acid derivative. Aliskiren is primarily metabolized by Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many other drugs, suggesting potential drug-drug interactions. Furthermore, it is a substrate of P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), a key transporter protein that influences the drug’s absorption and disposition in the body.

## Pharmacogenetics
Although specific pharmacogenetic data for aliskiren is not detailed in the provided DrugBank information and no substantial genomic data was found, general principles can be applied given its pharmacology. Variants in genes encoding for CYP3A4 might influence the metabolism of aliskiren, affecting both efficacy and safety. Similarly, genetic polymorphisms in ABCB1 could modify the drug’s transport characteristics, potentially altering its absorption and plasma concentrations. These genetic factors are critical to consider for personalized medicine approaches in treating hypertension with aliskiren, although targeted research and clinical guidelines would be necessary to implement routine pharmacogenetic testing.
