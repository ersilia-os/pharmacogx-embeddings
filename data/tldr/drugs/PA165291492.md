## Drug Summary
Pazopanib, developed by GlaxoSmithKline and FDA approved in 2009, is a multikinase inhibitor used primarily for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma and soft tissue sarcoma in patients who have previously undergone chemotherapy. Classified as a synthetic indazolylpyrimidine, it exhibits anticancer activity by inhibiting several protein tyrosine kinases. Pazopanib operates pharmacodynamically by blocking the phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs), which reduces tumor blood flow, promotes apoptosis, and decreases interstitial fluid pressure in tumors. The drug’s absorption in cancer patients is slow and incomplete, demonstrating a nonlinear relationship with the dosage and potential for significant accumulation. Pazopanib is predominantly metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme, with lesser involvement of CYP1A2 and CYP2C8, and its active metabolites are considerably less potent.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Pazopanib targets multiple receptors involved in angiogenesis and tumor growth pathways, including FLT1 (VEGFR1), KDR (VEGFR2), FLT4 (VEGFR3), PDGFRA, PDGFRB, KIT (c-kit), FGFR3, ITK, FGF1, and SH2B3. These targets are integral to the controlling pathways for cell proliferation and survival. The absorption and metabolism of pazopanib are affected by various enzymes and transporters; CYP3A4 plays a primary role in its metabolism, supported by CYP1A2 and CYP2C8. The transporters involved include ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), ABCG2, and SLCO1B1, impacting the drug's distribution and elimination. Notably, UGT1A1 is a key transporter pertinent to the drug’s glucuronidation.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors significantly influence the efficacy and safety of pazopanib. Variants in the UGT1A1 gene, such as rs3064744, are associated with increased risks of hyperbilirubinemia in patients treated with pazopanib. This adverse effect relates to the enzyme's role in bilirubin metabolism, where genetic variability can affect drug clearance and result in toxicity. Another important genetic variant is rs2395029 in the HCP5 gene, indicating a potential risk for elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) levels, which could lead to drug-related hepatotoxicity. These pharmacogenetic associations highlight the importance of considering genetic testing prior to pazopanib therapy to personalize treatment plans and mitigate risks of adverse drug reactions.
