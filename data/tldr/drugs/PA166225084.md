## Drug Summary
Selpercatinib, marketed under the brand name Retevmo, is a kinase inhibitor specifically targeting the RET tyrosine kinase receptors, crucial in many cancer types. Unlike traditional multikinase inhibitors, selpercatinib offers enhanced selectivity for RET, reducing off-target effects and associated toxicities. It is approved for the treatment of various RET-driven cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) with RET gene fusions or mutations. This drug achieves steady-state concentration within approximately 7 days when administered at 160 mg twice daily, and its bioavailability ranges between 60-82%. Selpercatinib's metabolism is primarily mediated by hepatic CYP3A4 enzymes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Selpercatinib acts principally by inhibiting the RET tyrosine kinase, which plays a significant role in cell proliferation and differentiation pathways related to tumorigenesis. It competes with ATP binding, preventing RET activation and downstream signaling. Selpercatinib also targets other kinases such as VEGFR1, VEGFR3, FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3, although these effects are less characterized. Key enzymes involved in selpercatinib's metabolism include CYP3A4 and CYP2C8. It interacts with transporters like ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), ABCG2, and SLC47A1, which might affect its distribution and excretion.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors significantly impact the efficacy and safety profile of selpercatinib. Given its metabolism by CYP3A4 and influence by various transport proteins such as ABCB1 and ABCG2, genetic variants in these genes could affect drug levels and response. For instance, polymorphisms in CYP3A4 affecting enzyme activity may alter selpercatinib metabolism, impacting its effectiveness and toxicity. Although direct pharmacogenetic data for selpercatinib are not extensively documented, research and clinical observations suggest that individual genetic variation could guide dosing and therapy choices, especially concerning toxicity management and resistance development. Further pharmacogenomic studies are likely needed to optimize its use in genetically diverse patient populations.
