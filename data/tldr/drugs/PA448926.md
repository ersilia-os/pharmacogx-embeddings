## Drug Summary
Chlorambucil, also known by brand names Celkeran and Chloraminophène, is a nitrogen mustard alkylating agent prominently used as an antineoplastic medication. It is indicated for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, certain malignant lymphomas including lymphosarcoma, giant follicular lymphoma, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia, and childhood minimal-change nephrotic syndrome. The pharmacodynamics of Chlorambucil involves its action as an alkylating agent. It binds to DNA, causing cross-linking of DNA strands and impeding DNA replication and transcription, effectively preventing cancerous cells from multiplying. This drug functions through several mechanisms: attaching alkyl groups to DNA bases, inducing DNA damage through cross-links, and causing nucleotide mispairing leading to mutations. Due to its potency, Chlorambucil has been classified as a known carcinogen.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Chlorambucil interacts with several enzymes in the glutathione S-transferase family, including GSTP1, GSTA1, GSTA2, GSTM1, GSTM2, GSTM3, GSTM4, GSTM5, GSTT1, GSTT2, GSTT2B, and HPGDS. These enzymes are important for detoxification processes, catalyzing the conjugation of glutathione to various substrates and thereby, playing a role in drug metabolism and resistance. The drug also involves an interaction with the transporter SLCO1A2, a member of the solute carrier organic anion transporter family, which influences its distribution and elimination. No specific carriers are mentioned for Chlorambucil in the provided data.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of Chlorambucil predicates heavily on its interactions with various glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). Variations in genes encoding these enzymes could affect the metabolism of Chlorambucil, potentially altering efficacy and toxicity profiles of the drug. Genotypes such as GSTM1 and GSTT1 deletions can affect drug response. For example, absence of GSTM1 and GSTT1, commonly observed in certain populations, might lead to altered detoxification of Chlorambucil, impacting its therapeutic effectiveness and tolerability. Although specific genomic data are not provided, understanding and testing these genetic markers before initiating Chlorambucil therapy could guide dosage adjustments and improve patient outcomes through more personalized treatment approaches.
