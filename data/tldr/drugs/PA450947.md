## Drug Summary
Phenytoin, also known under brand names such as Epanutin and Eptoin, is a widely used anticonvulsant medication belonging to the hydantoin derivative class. Introduced over 80 years ago, its primary indication is for the management of grand mal seizures, complex partial seizures, and prevention or treatment of seizures during or following neurosurgery. Phenytoin exhibits a narrow therapeutic index, necessitating careful therapeutic drug monitoring. Its pharmacokinetics reveal complete absorption with peak plasma concentrations achieved within 1.5 to 12 hours, depending on the formulation. The drug is extensively metabolized primarily through the generation of an arene oxide intermediate that is responsible for some of its adverse effects including hepatotoxicity and severe cutaneous reactions. Due to its high protein-binding capacity, factors influencing serum albumin can markedly affect drug bioavailability and therapeutic outcomes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Phenytoin acts predominantly as a non-specific sodium channel blocker, affecting various subtypes of voltage-gated sodium channels such as SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN3A, SCN5A, and SCN8A. It also interacts with components of calcium channels (such as CACNA1C and CACNB subunits) and GABA(A) receptors. Metabolism of phenytoin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which significantly influence the metabolic pathway and pharmacokinetic profile. It is also metabolized by enzymes like CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 and cleared via glucuronidation pathways involving multiple UGT enzymes. Transporters such as ABCB1 and ABCC2 and serum proteins like ALB (albumin) play critical roles in its distribution and clearance.

## Pharmacogenetics
Phenytoin's metabolism and the risk of adverse effects are significantly influenced by genetic factors. Variants of the CYP2C9 gene, such as those denoted by rs1057910, are associated with reduced enzymatic activity leading to decreased metabolism of phenytoin, which can result in drug accumulation and toxicity if doses are not adjusted. Additionally, certain HLA-B alleles have been linked to a heightened risk of severe skin reactions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis in patients treated with phenytoin. The presence of these genetic factors necessitates preemptive genotyping or careful monitoring in clinical settings to tailor phenytoin therapy effectively and mitigate potential drug-related harms.
