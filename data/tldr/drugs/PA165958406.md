## Drug Summary
Dimercaprol, also known by the names Bal In Oil Injection, Dimaval, and TechneScan DMSA, is a chelating agent first developed during World War II by British biochemists at Oxford University as an experimental antidote against the arsenic-based poison gas Lewisite. Since 1949, it has been used clinically for the treatment of arsenic, gold, and mercury poisoning. Additionally, it is indicated for acute lead poisoning in conjunction with edetate calcium disodium. Dimercaprol is administered via deep intramuscular injection, which is notably painful and allergenic. The drug is known for its ability to worsen certain conditions, such as relocating lead to the brain thereby heightening its neurotoxic effects, and increasing kidney cadmium concentration, making it unsuitable for cadmium toxicity cases.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Dimercaprol acts by forming complexes with certain heavy metals through its sulfhydryl groups. This action prevents or reverses the binding of these metals to sulfhydryl-containing enzymes, which are critical for numerous biochemical processes. The resulting complexes are subsequently excreted via urine, thereby reducing metal toxicity in the body. The specific protein reported as a target for dimercaprol is the Amyloid beta A4 protein (APP) in humans, although this interaction and its implications are not fully elucidated. There is no available information about direct involvement of specific enzymes, transporters, or carriers in the pharmacokinetics of dimercaprol, further data might be needed to fully understand these aspects.

## Pharmacogenetics
There are no specific pharmacogenetic data provided or widely recognized for dimercaprol. This may be due in part to its primary mechanism involving direct chemical interaction with metal ions, rather than modulation of biological pathways that might be more variable between individuals due to genetic differences. However, given its severe side effect profile and the complexity of metal toxicity detoxification, genetic variations impacting the metabolism, transport, or excretion of the drug-metal complexes could potentially influence its efficacy and safety. Such interactions are speculative in the absence of specific pharmacogenetic studies or reports. Future research exploring the genetic factors influencing outcomes in patients treated with dimercaprol could potentially improve the understanding and management of metal poisoning treatments.
