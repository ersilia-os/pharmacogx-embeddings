## Drug Summary
Cavosonstat, also known by its research code N91115, is an investigational drug listed on DrugBank with the ID DB14775 and on PharmGKB as PA166163226. It was under investigation in clinical trials, notably in trial NCT02589236, which focused on patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. The detailed description of its pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, absorption, metabolism, and mechanism of action are not documented in the provided DrugBank entry. Thus, specific functional details including its therapeutic class remain unestablished in the accessible summary.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
According to the given data from DrugBank, there are no specified targets, enzymes, transporters, or carriers for Cavosonstat. The drug appears to be in the early stages of research with limited published data on its specific interactions at the molecular level. This absence of data indicates that the understanding of how Cavosonstat interacts within the body is not yet clear or publicly available from the provided sources.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of Cavosonstat remains undocumented as no genomic data or specific pharmacogenetic associations are mentioned in the provided DrugBank entry. Since it is targeted at patients with CF who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene, there might be potential pharmacogenetic relevance due to the genetic basis of its target population. However, without specific data on how Cavosonstat interacts with genetic variants, any inference on pharmacogenetic interactions would be speculative. Further research and clinical trial results would be needed to elucidate any meaningful pharmacogenetic implications.
