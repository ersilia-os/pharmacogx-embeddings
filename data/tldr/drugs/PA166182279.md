## Drug Summary
Dacomitinib, known by its chemical structure as (2E)-N-16-4-(piperidin-1-yl) but-2-enamide, is a highly selective, second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor with irreversible binding capabilities. It specifically targets the ATP binding sites of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family kinase domains. Developed by Pfizer Inc, it was approved by the FDA in 2018. Dacomitinib is used primarily as a first-line treatment for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients who have specific EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations, as identified by an FDA-approved test. It demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics, with an absorption that is not significantly affected by food, and it achieves a high oral bioavailability of 80%. Metabolism of dacomitinib occurs mainly through oxidative and conjugative pathways involving several cytochrome P450 enzymes and glutathione.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Dacomitinib acts irreversibly by inhibiting the tyrosine kinase activity of the EGFR/HER family, including EGFR (HER1), HER2, and HER4, by forming covalent bonds with cysteine residues in their catalytic domains. The main enzymes involved in its metabolism are CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9, with CYP3A4 playing a significant role in forming lesser metabolites. The drug's major metabolite, PF-05199265, is predominantly formed by CYP2D6. Additionally, Dacomitinib is transported by ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), ABCG2, and SLC22A1, and its association with serum albumin (ALB) indicates its involvement in systemic distribution and possibly in its pharmacokinetics behavior.

## Pharmacogenetics
Dacomitinib's clinical efficacy and safety can be influenced by genetic variations in its target, EGFR, and the enzymes responsible for its metabolism. Specifically, mutations in the EGFR gene, such as exon 19 deletions or the L858R substitution, make tumors more susceptible to EGFR inhibitors like dacomitinib. Variants in the metabolizing enzymes CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9 could impact the drug's metabolism, altering its pharmacokinetics and potentially leading to differences in drug exposure, which in turn might affect both efficacy and toxicity. For example, polymorphisms in CYP2D6, which is known to metabolize dacomitinib significantly, could lead to different metabolic rates among individuals, potentially necessitating dose adjustments. Genetic testing is recommended to identify eligible patients for this therapy and might also be beneficial for optimizing dosing and minimizing toxicity.
