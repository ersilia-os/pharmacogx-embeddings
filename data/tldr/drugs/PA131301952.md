## Drug Summary
Gefitinib, marketed under the name Iressa, belongs to the class of selective epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors used chiefly in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has not responded to other therapies like platinum-based or docetaxel chemotherapies. The drug works by blocking the intracellular phosphorylation of tyrosine kinases linked to the cell surface receptor EGFR. This receptor is frequently overexpressed in several types of carcinoma cells, including those found in lung and breast cancer, contributing to the cancer cells’ survival and proliferation. Gefitinib exhibits a mean oral bioavailability of 60% and reaches peak plasma levels within 3-7 hours. It is predominantly metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP3A4.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Gefitinib's main mechanism of action is the inhibition of EGFR (also known as Her1 or ErbB-1). It binds to the ATP-binding site of EGFR, preventing kinase activity, which is crucial for the cancer cells’ aberrant growth signaling pathways. The metabolism of gefitinib involves several cytochrome P450 enzymes: CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP1A1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are responsible for biotransformation processes, including demethylation and dioxygenation. Additionally, important transporters involved with gefitinib include P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1) and ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2), which can affect the drug's distribution and excretion. The protein carriers serum albumin (ALB) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1) also play roles in its pharmacokinetics by affecting its plasma binding characteristics.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic data indicates significant interactions relating to gefitinib’s efficacy and safety profiles based on genetic variants. Notably, several polymorphisms in the EGFR gene, such as rs121434568, rs28929495, and rs121913444, are associated with higher response rates to gefitinib. This suggests that patients with these genetic variations may experience better therapeutic outcomes. Additionally, the rs2231142 polymorphism in the ABCG2 gene has been linked to an increased risk of experiencing diarrhea as an adverse drug reaction. These genetic markers can be crucial for guiding treatment decisions and dosage adjustments to optimize therapy effectiveness and minimize adverse effects, highlighting the potential for personalized medicine approaches in cancer treatment with gefitinib.
