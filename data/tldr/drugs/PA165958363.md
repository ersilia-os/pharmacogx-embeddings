## Drug Summary
Agomelatine, also known under the brand names Melitor and Valdoxan, is an antidepressant used for the treatment of major depressive episodes in adults. Structurally similar to melatonin, agomelatine primarily functions as a potent agonist at melatonin receptors (MT1 and MT2) and as an antagonist at the serotonin-2C (5-HT2C) receptors. The drug's unique action profile helps resynchronize circadian rhythms, which is particularly beneficial in conditions like delayed sleep phase syndrome and other circadian rhythm disruptions. Despite its innovative mechanism, its development was initially met with challenges in regulatory approval due to concerns about its efficacy. However, it is currently available on the market in countries like Australia. The drug is poorly absorbed, with a bioavailability of less than 5%, and it is mainly metabolized in the liver, predominantly by CYP1A2, and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Agomelatine exerts its therapeutic effects by targeting the melatonin receptors MTNR1A and MTNR1B, where it acts as an agonist, and the serotonin receptor HTR2C, where it functions as an antagonist. These receptor interactions contribute to its antidepressive and chronobiotic properties. The drug undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism involving primarily the enzyme CYP1A2, which is responsible for about 90% of its metabolic clearance, and CYP2C9, accounting for the remaining 10%. There are no significant interactions involving transporters or carriers reported for agomelatine.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of agomelatine largely revolves around its metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP1A2 and CYP2C9. Variations in the genes encoding these enzymes can significantly influence the metabolism and overall effectiveness of agomelatine. For example, polymorphisms in CYP1A2 can alter the enzyme's activity, potentially affecting the drug's clearance and leading to variations in therapeutic outcomes or side effects. Individuals with reduced CYP1A2 activity may experience higher concentrations of the drug, increasing the risk of adverse effects, whereas those with increased CYP1A2 activity might have reduced drug levels, potentially decreasing its efficacy. There is currently no specific pharmacogenetic testing routinely recommended before starting agomelatine, but understanding these genetic differences could aid in personalizing treatment plans for better therapeutic results.
