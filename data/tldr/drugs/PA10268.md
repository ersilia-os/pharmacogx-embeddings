## Drug Summary
Flupentixol, marketed under brand names such as Depixol, Fluanxol, and Jexit, is an antipsychotic medication belonging to the thioxanthene class. It is primarily used for the maintenance therapy of chronic schizophrenia, principally in patients whose symptoms do not include excitement, agitation, or hyperactivity. Additionally, Flupentixol is employed in the management of depression and anxiety, either alone or in combination with melitracen. The drug is administered in oral tablets or long-acting intramuscular injections, showing significant therapeutic effects in various psychiatric conditions. The pharmacodynamics of Flupentixol involves antagonism at dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, which is believed to contribute to its antipsychotic and some antidepressant effects. The absorption, distribution, and metabolism of the drug highlight a notable oral bioavailability of about 40% with metabolism primarily occurring in the liver through processes like sulfoxidation and glucuronidation.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Flupentixol acts by antagonizing multiple receptor targets including dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD1, DRD3, DRD4), serotonin receptors (HTR2A, HTR2C), and the alpha-1A adrenergic receptor (ADRA1A). It also partially engages with the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1 (CHRM1). In terms of enzymes, the drug is metabolized by liver carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) and aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase (DDC). The transporter protein P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1) is implicated in its transport mechanisms, influencing the drug's pharmacokinetics and potentially its response variance among individuals.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of Flupentixol is an evolving field. Variability in the genes encoding for targets such as dopamine and serotonin receptors (e.g., DRD2, HTR2A) can influence individual responses to the medication, potentially impacting its efficacy and safety profile. Additionally, genetic variation in metabolic enzymes like CES1 and transport proteins such as ABCB1 could alter drug levels and effects, necessitating adjustments in dosing or even the selection of different therapeutic agents. No specific pharmacogenetic guidelines are currently established for Flupentixol, however, ongoing studies and broader pharmacogenomics research could provide deeper insights into tailored drug therapy based on genetic profiles. This would potentially enhance therapeutic outcomes by minimizing adverse effects and optimizing drug efficacy.
