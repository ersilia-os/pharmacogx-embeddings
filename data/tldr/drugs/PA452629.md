## Drug Summary
Zuclopenthixol, known under various brand names such as Acuphase, Ciatyl-Z, Cisordinol, and Clopixol, is an antipsychotic medication primarily used to manage acute psychoses, including mania and schizophrenia. Classified as a typical antipsychotic from the thioxanthene class, it acts similarly to phenothiazine antipsychotics. Zuclopenthixol functions by antagonizing D1 and D2 dopamine receptors, which are crucial in the pathophysiology of psychosis. It is administered in a decanoate form (long-acting) allowing slow release that aids in managing symptoms over a longer period without frequent dosing. The drug was approved in Canada in 2011 but remains unapproved in the United States. Metabolism of zuclopenthixol involves sulphoxidation, N-dealkylation, and conjugation with glucuronic acid, predominantly through Cytochrome P450 2D6.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Zuclopenthixol primarily targets the dopamine receptors, specifically DRD1, DRD2, and DRD5, which are key receptors involved in the mediation of psychotic symptoms. It also exhibits affinity for the alpha-1A adrenergic receptor (ADRA1A) and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (HTR2A), contributing to its antipsychotic effects. Notably, it has weaker interactions with histamine H1 (HRH1) and alpha-2A adrenergic receptors (ADRA2A). In terms of metabolism, zuclopenthixol is predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4, which handle oxidative and conjugative processes crucial for the drug's elimination. There are currently no specific transporters or carriers listed that are significantly involved with the pharmacokinetics of zuclopenthixol.

## Pharmacogenetics
The metabolism of zuclopenthixol is significantly influenced by CYP2D6 enzyme activity, with variations in the CYP2D6 gene impacting the drug's pharmacokinetics and patient response. Patients with poor metabolizer status due to specific genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6 may experience higher plasma concentrations of zuclopenthixol, leading to heightened risk of adverse effects. On the other hand, individuals with higher enzyme activity (ultra-rapid metabolizers) may require higher doses to achieve therapeutic effects. These pharmacogenomic factors are crucial in tailoring antipsychotic therapy to individual genetic profiles to optimize efficacy and minimize toxicity. However, concrete studies and inclusion of comprehensive genomic data are needed to fully integrate these factors into clinical practice for prescribing zuclopenthixol.
