## Drug Summary
Gemfibrozil, traded under various brand names such as Gemlipid, Gen-Fibro, and Jezil, is a fibric acid derivative primarily used to manage several types of hyperlipidemias (Type IIb, IV, V). Approved by the FDA in 1981, this medication is indicated for patients with notably high serum triglycerides, who are at risk of pancreatitis and have not adequately responded to non-pharmacological interventions such as diet and exercise. The mechanism of action of gemfibrozil involves the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), which significantly modulates lipid metabolism leading to increased lipolysis and decreased synthesis of triglycerides. Its pharmacokinetic properties show considerable oral absorption, undergoing metabolic processes like hydroxylation and glucuronidation, mainly mediated by the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT).

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Gemfibrozil’s primary biological target is PPARα, playing a central role in altering lipid profiles by mechanisms such as increasing HDL cholesterol and inhibiting VLDL production. Additionally, gemfibrozil acts on various transporters and carriers including SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, SLCO2B1, and the organic anion transporter SLC22A8, demonstrating complex interactions affecting drug distribution and efficacy. Enzyme interaction is notable with CYP2C8, where gemfibrozil acts as an inhibitor. Other cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4 are also involved to a lesser extent. The drug's metabolism involves multiple UGT enzymes such as UGT2B7, UGT1A1, and others, which are crucial for its glucuronidation process. Serum albumin (ALB) serves as a carrier, potentially affecting the drug's systemic circulation and distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of gemfibrozil is particularly centric to its interaction with CYP2C8 and various UGT genes like UGT1A1 and UGT2B7, influencing both its metabolism and pharmacokinetics. Genetic variants in CYP2C8 can alter the drug's efficacy and safety profile, wherein poor metabolizers may experience increased exposure to the drug, possibly elevating the risk of adverse effects. Variation in UGT genes might modify the rate of gemfibrozil's glucuronidation, further impacting therapeutic outcomes and tolerability. While specific genetic tests are not routinely recommended before starting gemfibrozil, understanding these gene-drug interactions could be beneficial in managing dose adjustments and predicting therapeutic responses or risk of side effects in patients with genetic predispositions.
