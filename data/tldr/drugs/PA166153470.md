## Drug Summary
Ribociclib, marketed under the name Kisqali, is a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6). It belongs to a class of drugs known as CDK inhibitors, which are used to slow the progression of cancer by blocking proteins that promote cell division. Ribociclib specifically targets over-activated CDK4 and CDK6, preventing cancer cells from proliferating uncontrollably. This mechanism potentially creates a therapeutic window with reduced toxicity compared to broader cytotoxic agents. Approved by the FDA in 2017, ribociclib is primarily utilized in the treatment of certain types of breast cancer. The drug is orally bioavailable, with systemic exposure increasing proportionally to the dosage. Achieving peak plasma concentrations between 1 to 5 hours post-administration, ribociclib's absorption characteristics support its effectiveness in sustained cancer treatment regimes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Ribociclib acts by inhibiting the activity of CDK4 and CDK6, which are critical in the G1 checkpoint of the cell cycle, thereby preventing the progression of the cell cycle in tumor cells. This targeted inhibition helps manage the proliferation of tumor cells, notably in breast cancer where these kinases play significant roles. Metabolism of ribociclib involves the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4, a major enzyme responsible for the oxidation of many drugs. Ribociclib does not appear to significantly involve other transporters or carrier proteins based on the provided information, indicating that its pharmacokinetic profile is predominantly influenced by its interaction with CYP3A4.

## Pharmacogenetics
As ribociclib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4, genetic variations in the CYP3A4 gene can significantly affect the drugâ€™s pharmacokinetics and overall patient response. Allelic variants of CYP3A4 that alter enzyme activity could lead to differences in drug levels, potentially requiring dosage adjustments to optimize therapeutic effects and minimize toxicity. However, tangible clinical data specifically linking CYP3A4 polymorphisms with ribociclib outcomes is limited, necessitating careful consideration and possibly genetic testing in clinical settings. Enhanced understanding of these pharmacogenetic associations could guide personalized dosing regimens, improving efficacy and safety profiles for patients undergoing treatment with ribociclib.
