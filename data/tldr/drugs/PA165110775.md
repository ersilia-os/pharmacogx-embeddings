## Drug Summary
SN-38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin) is the active metabolite of the prodrug irinotecan, used primarily in the treatment of various cancers including colorectal cancer. SN-38 is significantly more potent than irinotecan itself. It acts as a topoisomerase I inhibitor, interfering with the essential function of topoisomerase I, which is to relieve torsional strain in DNA by inducing single-strand breaks. SN-38 binds to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevents the relegation of these single-strand breaks. The pharmacokinetics of SN-38 involves its formation from irinotecan by the action of carboxylesterases, primarily in the liver, and further metabolism by conjugation to form SN-38 glucuronide. SN-38 itself is poorly water-soluble, which contributes to its formulation challenges.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary target of SN-38 is the DNA topoisomerase I enzyme, which is crucial for DNA replication and transcription by relieving supercoiling pressures. By stabilizing the transient break caused by topoisomerase I on the DNA strand, SN-38 enhances the cytotoxicity during the replication of rapidly dividing cancer cells, ultimately leading to apoptosis. Metabolism of its prodrug, irinotecan, to SN-38, involves carboxylesterases, and the metabolite is primarily eliminated by glucuronidation through UGT1A1. Transport of SN-38 in and out of cells may involve various transporters, though specifics such as involvement of ABC transporters could be inferred given their role in chemotherapeutic drug movements.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetics plays a significant role in the effectiveness and toxicity of SN-38. The metabolism of SN-38 primarily involves the enzyme UGT1A1, which glucuronidates SN-38 to form SN-38G, a less toxic and more easily excreted form. Polymorphisms in the UGT1A1 gene, particularly UGT1A1*28, result in reduced activity of this enzyme, leading to higher levels of the active and toxic SN-38 and associated side effects such as severe neutropenia and diarrhea. Testing for UGT1A1 polymorphisms is recommended prior to initiating therapy with irinotecan to personalize dosing and minimize toxicity. The pharmacogenetics of other enzymes, transporters, and targets involved in SN-38 activity and metabolism could further influence drug resistance and effectiveness but are less well-defined compared to the impact of UGT1A1 polymorphisms.
