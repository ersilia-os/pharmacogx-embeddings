## Drug Summary
Panobinostat, also known by its brand names Farydak and Faridak, is an oral deacetylase (DAC) inhibitor primarily used in the treatment of multiple myeloma. Approved by the FDA on February 23, 2015, its use is indicated in combination with dexamethasone and bortezomib for patients who have previously undergone at least two treatment regimens, including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent. As a pan-HDAC inhibitor, Panobinostat non-selectively inhibits a wide range of histone deacetylases (HDACs), contributing to its effectiveness in multiple myeloma by influencing gene expression and protein metabolism, which are crucial in cancer cell proliferation and survival. Panobinostat is particularly noted for its potent DAC inhibitory activity and is mostly metabolized via reduction, hydrolysis, oxidation, and glucuronidation, with CYP and non-CYP enzymes playing significant roles.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Panobinostat targets a broad spectrum of histone deacetylases, inhibiting class I (HDAC 1, 2, 3, 8), class II (HDAC 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10), and class IV (HDAC 11). This inhibition disrupts critical cellular functions such as DNA replication, transcription, and chromatin remodeling, thereby exerting antitumor activity. In terms of metabolism, panobinostat is extensively metabolized mainly by non-CYP enzymes and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. The drug is also a substrate for the transporter ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), which could affect its distribution and excretion.

## Pharmacogenetics
Variability in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Panobinostat might be influenced by genetic polymorphisms in the enzymes and transporters involved in its metabolism and transport, particularly CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and ABCB1. Since CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 are polymorphic enzymes with some variants leading to altered enzyme activity, genetic variations in these enzymes could affect the levels and effects of Panobinostat, potentially impacting both efficacy and toxicity. Furthermore, genetic variations in ABCB1 may affect the drug's pharmacokinetics and responses, as it plays a significant role in drug transport across cellular membranes. However, specific pharmacogenetic guidelines or strong clinical evidence directly linking genetic variation to Panobinostat's therapeutic outcomes are currently limited, and such associations may require further clinical validation.
