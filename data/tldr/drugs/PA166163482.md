## Drug Summary
Brigatinib, branded as AP26113 and approved by the FDA in 2017, is a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor primarily used in the treatment of anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK+) metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Developed by Ariad Pharmaceuticals, now a subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical, brigatinib demonstrates a distinctive capability in inhibiting both ALK and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), showing particular efficacy in targeting mutant forms of EGFR and various crizotinib-resistant mutants. The medication is particularly indicated for patients who are intolerant to crizotinib, a previously preferred treatment. Brigatinib's pharmacokinetics reveal that its absorption and systemic exposure increase dose-proportionally, with significant bioavailability and a peak plasma concentration time of 1 to 4 hours post-administration.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Brigatinib acts on multiple crucial oncogenic tyrosine kinases including ALK, EGFR, ABL1, IGF1R (Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor), FLT3, INSR (Insulin receptor), MET (Hepatocyte growth factor receptor), ERBB4, and ERBB2. These targets play diverse roles in cancer cell proliferation and survival. Brigatinib is metabolized predominantly by CYP2C8, along with significant involvement of CYP3A4, and lesser contributions from other CYP3A family enzymes like CYP3A43, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7. Transport-wise, brigatinib is handled by ABCB5, ABCG2, and solute carrier family proteins such as SLC22A1, SLC47A1, and SLC47A2, which may affect the drug's distribution and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of brigatinib is influenced by its metabolism involving primarily CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. Variants within these genes can affect the drug's efficacy and safety profile. For instance, genetic polymorphisms in CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 might lead to variability in drug metabolism rates among individuals, impacting both therapeutic outcomes and the risk of adverse effects. Furthermore, genetic aberrations in target proteins like ALK, EGFR, and FLT3 might predict responsiveness to brigatinib. Patients harboring specific mutant forms of these kinases often exhibit differential responses to brigatinib, underpinning the importance of molecular diagnostic testing prior to therapy initiation. Overall, the integration of genetic testing into clinical decision-making could enhance personalized therapy approaches in NSCLC treatment with brigatinib.
