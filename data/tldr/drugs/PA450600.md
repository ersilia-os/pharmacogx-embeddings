## Drug Summary
Nateglinide, also known by brand names such as Fastic and Starsis, is an oral antidiabetic medication used primarily for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in conjunction with diet and exercise. It belongs to the class of drugs known as meglitinides, which are short-acting insulin secretagogues. Nateglinide stimulates the beta cells of the pancreas to release insulin in a glucose-dependent manner, primarily reducing postprandial (after meal) blood glucose levels. It is notable for its rapid absorption and fast onset of action, generally taking effect within 20 minutes of oral administration. The drug's effects last approximately 4 hours, with peak plasma concentrations usually achieved within an hour. Nateglinide is extensively metabolized by the liver involving primarily CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 pathways, with the majority of the drug and its metabolites being excreted in the urine.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Nateglinide primarily targets the ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 8 (ABCC8), which plays a crucial role in regulating insulin secretion by modulating ATP-sensitive potassium channels in pancreatic beta cells. It also interacts with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG). The metabolism of nateglinide involves several enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, PTGS1, and UGT1A9, with CYP2C9 being the primary pathway for its bioactivation. CYP2D6 also plays a role albeit to a lesser extent. It interacts with various transporters including the ABCC4, which is involved in drug resistance, and SLC22A6, important for organic anion transport. Carriers like serum albumin (ALB) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1) are involved in its systemic distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
Nateglinide metabolism is significantly influenced by genetic variations in the CYP2C9 enzyme. Variants such as CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 have been associated with altered drug metabolism which can affect both the efficacy and safety of nateglinide, potentially leading to either suboptimal glucose control or increased risk of hypoglycemia. Furthermore, genetic polymorphisms in SLC22A6 and ABCC4 transporters might influence the drugâ€™s pharmacokinetics and subsequent glucose-lowering effect. Individuals carrying certain alleles of these genes could demonstrate differential response rates or side effects to nateglinide, underscoring the importance of personalized medicine approaches in diabetes management. This might suggest that pharmacogenetic testing could be beneficial in optimizing nateglinide therapy for individual patients, although implementation in clinical practice may depend on further confirmatory studies.
