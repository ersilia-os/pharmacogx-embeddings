## Drug Summary
Meclizine, also marketed under names like Chiclida, Meclicot, Navicalm, Nevidoxine, Postafen, and Sea-Legs, is a histamine H1 receptor antagonist renowned for its antiemetic and antivertigo properties. Classified under antiemetics and antinauseants, it is primarily used to counteract symptoms associated with motion sickness, such as nausea, vomiting, and dizziness, and is also employed in managing vertigo due to varied causes like Meniereâ€™s syndrome and labyrinthitis. Meclizine demonstrates an onset of action typically around one hour after administration, with its effects lasting from eight to 24 hours. The absorption of meclizine is considered high with peak plasma concentrations reached approximately three hours post-dose. Metabolism of meclizine is somewhat unclear but is thought to involve the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme. 

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Meclizine targets the Histamine H1 receptor (HRH1) and Nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 3 (NR1I3) in humans. Its primary mechanism involves the antagonism of the HRH1, reducing neurotransmission in pathways involved in causing vomiting and disturbed equilibrium. It may also affect the NTS and vestibular nuclei linked to the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) and vomiting center in the brainstem. Metabolically, meclizine is processed through pathways involving the hepatic enzyme CYP2D6, which is responsible for aromatic hydroxylation and benzylic oxidation. Additionally, meclizine is known to bind to serum albumin (ALB), which may influence its distribution and pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of meclizine largely revolves around its metabolism by the enzyme CYP2D6. Variations in the CYP2D6 gene can lead to different metabolic rates among individuals, influencing the drug's efficacy and safety. Polymorphisms in CYP2D6 can categorize patients as poor, intermediate, extensive, or ultrarapid metabolizers, potentially impacting the therapeutic outcomes and risk of side effects. For example, poor metabolizers might experience prolonged drug action or increased side effects, while ultrarapid metabolizers may require higher doses to achieve therapeutic effects. While specific pharmacogenetic guidelines for meclizine are not comprehensively established, considering CYP2D6 polymorphisms could be crucial in personalized drug therapy to optimize treatment efficacy and minimize adverse reactions.
