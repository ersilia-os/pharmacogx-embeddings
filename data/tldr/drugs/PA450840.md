## Drug Summary
Penicillamine, also known by its brand name Atamir, belongs to the chelator class of pharmaceuticals. Used primarily in its D-enantiomer form, D-penicillamine, because its L-enantiomer is toxic and inhibits pyridoxine (vitamin B6). Penicillamine is derived from penicillin but does not have any antibiotic properties. It is indicated for the treatment of Wilson's disease, a genetic disorder that causes excessive copper accumulation, and cystinuria, a condition characterized by high cystine levels in the urine. Additionally, it is utilized in the management of severe, active rheumatoid arthritis, particularly when patients do not respond to conventional therapies. The drug acts via several mechanisms; as a chelating agent, it binds copper in Wilson's disease for urinary elimination and transforms cystine into more soluble compounds in cystinuria. In rheumatoid arthritis, it is thought to act as an immunosuppressant, inhibiting macrophages and T-cell function, without significantly affecting serum immunoglobulin levels or B-cell activity. Penicillamine is absorbed rapidly though incompletely and is metabolized in the liver.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Penicillamine does not have a specific molecular target that mediates its effects directly like enzymes or receptors. Instead, its therapeutic efficacy is largely dependent on its chemical properties as a chelating agent. Mechanistically, it forms a complex with copper in Wilson's disease and facilitates the production of a soluble derivative of cystine in cystinuria, aiding in reduction and elimination of these substances from the body. For drug transport mechanisms, Penicillamine's pharmacokinetics involves the transporter protein SLCO1B1 (Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1), which is known to impact its distribution and excretion in humans. The details of interactions with other transporters or carriers are not provided, and no specific drug-metabolizing enzymes were mentioned in the information provided.

## Pharmacogenetics
As per the available information, no specific pharmacogenetic data were provided for Penicillamine, and no known major pharmacogenetic associations are typically highlighted in routine medical or pharmacological references for this drug. Nevertheless, the involvement of the transporter SLCO1B1 suggests potential pharmacogenetic implications, as genetic variants in the SLCO1B1 gene are known to affect the pharmacokinetics of various drugs. These variants can alter drug transport activity, potentially affecting the efficacy and toxicity of drugs like Penicillamine. Given the role of SLCO1B1 in drug transport, patients with differing genetic variants of this transporter might experience variations in the drug's absorption and elimination, which could impact therapeutic outcomes and adverse effect profiles.
