## Drug Summary
Debrisoquine, sold under brand names such as Bonipress, Declinax, and Tendor, is principally utilized for the management of moderate to severe hypertension, whether as a monotherapy or an adjunct treatment, particularly in renal hypertension. This medication belongs to the adrenergic neuron-blocking class which influences the adrenergic system akin to guanethidine. Its primary action impairs the release or dispersal of norepinephrine acting at the sympathetic neuroeffector junction. Once administered, Debrisoquine is involved in noradrenaline transport processes and eventually depletes the neurotransmitter stores by replacing it in the vesicles. The drug's predictable antihypertensive effects originate from both diminished peripheral resistance and reduced cardiac output, with additional blood pressure reduction upon postural changes due to attenuation of reflex sympathetic nervous activity. Debrisoquine's metabolism is primarily hepatic.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Debrisoquine modulates the sodium-dependent noradrenaline transporter (SLC6A2), crucial for norepinephrine reuptake at nerve endings, which results in the disturbance in neurotransmitter storage and release. The drug is metabolized in the liver with the involvement of cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP1A1 and the polymorphic CYP2D6 that influences variable patient responses due to genetic differences. Additionally, the drug is a substrate of the transporter P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), which plays a significant role in controlling the drug's bioavailability and disposition across the cells, notably affecting its systemic concentration and therapeutic effects.

## Pharmacogenetics
Debrisoquine pharmacogenetics is particularly notable due to its metabolism involving cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), an enzyme with genetically determined variability in activity that can significantly affect the drug's efficacy and safety. Variations in CYP2D6 can classify individuals as poor, intermediate, extensive, or ultrarapid metabolizers, leading to significant interindividual differences in drug exposure and clinical response. Poor metabolizers (with deficient enzyme activity due to certain CYP2D6 allelic variants) may experience increased plasma levels leading to adverse effects, whereas ultrarapid metabolizers may require higher doses to achieve therapeutic effect. Incorporating pharmacogenetic testing prior to initiating debrisoquine therapy can enhance therapeutic outcomes by tailoring doses according to the metabolic profile dictated by CYP2D6 genotypes. This approach can help avoid subtherapeutic effects and adverse drug reactions, promoting a more personalized medication strategy.
