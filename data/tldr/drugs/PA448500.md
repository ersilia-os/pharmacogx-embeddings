## Drug Summary
Atorvastatin, sold under various brand names such as Lipitor®, is a prominent statin medication primarily used for lowering blood lipid levels to manage various dyslipidemias and prevent cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Statins like atorvastatin function by inhibiting the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme in the liver, crucial for cholesterol synthesis. This inhibition leads to reduced levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides, while increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Atorvastatin's efficacy in reducing LDL cholesterol ranges between 36-53%, making it a staple in cardiovascular risk management protocols. Key pharmacokinetics include rapid oral absorption, extensive first-pass liver metabolism primarily via CYP3A4, and dose-dependent non-linear pharmacokinetics.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Atorvastatin exerts its pharmacological action by competitively inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. Additionally, it has been noted to interact with other targets such as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), and nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 3 (NR1I3). The drug is extensively metabolized in the liver with the involvement of several enzymes including CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and various UGTs like UGT1A1 and UGT1A3. Transporters such as P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), SLCO1B1, and other members of the SLCO family play roles in its distribution and elimination. Serum albumin acts as a carrier for atorvastatin, which influences its systemic availability.

## Pharmacogenetics
Atorvastatin pharmacogenetics reveals significant interactions influenced by genetic variants. Key polymorphisms in genes such as SLCO1B1 (e.g., c.521T>C) have been shown to affect the drug’s pharmacokinetics, altering plasma concentrations and potentially the risk of adverse effects such as myopathy. CYP3A4 variants influence metabolizing efficiency, impacting efficacy and safety profiles of the drug. Notably, polymorphisms in KIF6 and HMGCR are associated with differential cardiovascular risk reduction and LDL cholesterol response to atorvastatin therapy, respectively. These genetic factors are crucial for tailoring atorvastatin therapy to individual patients to maximize benefits while minimizing adverse effects.
