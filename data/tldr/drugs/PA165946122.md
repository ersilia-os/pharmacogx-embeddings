## Drug Summary
Crizotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor primarily used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is positive for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) or ROS1, as well as ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT). Approved by the FDA in 2011, crizotinib targets multiple kinases including ALK, MET (HGFR), ROS1, and RON. Its efficacy is particularly noted in NSCLC patients with ALK-positive tumors typically due to EML4-ALK fusion proteins. Crizotinib's pharmacokinetics involves moderate bioavailability, dose-proportional pharmacokinetics, and primary metabolism by hepatic enzymes, predominantly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Primary adverse effects include hepatotoxicity, interstitial lung disease, and QT interval prolongation.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Crizotinib acts on several key molecular targets: it inhibits the tyrosine kinase activities of ALK, MET, ROS1, and MST1R. These targets play crucial roles in cellular proliferation and survival, particularly in cancer cells harboring specific genetic rearrangements like EML4-ALK. The drug is mainly metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, with minor contributions from CYP2B6 and potentially other CYP3A family members. Crizotinib is also a substrate for the transporter protein P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), influencing its cellular uptake and distribution. Additionally, the drug binds to plasma proteins such as albumin (ALB) and alpha1-acid glycoprotein (ORM2), which can affect its pharmacokinetics and distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of crizotinib is significantly influenced by variations in genes encoding its metabolic enzymes and transport proteins. Polymorphisms in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 can alter crizotinib metabolism, potentially affecting both the drug's efficacy and toxicity profile. For instance, CYP3A5 expressers (polymorphic variant CYP3A5*1 allele carriers) might metabolize crizotinib more rapidly than non-expressers, possibly necessitating dose adjustments. ABCB1 polymorphisms could also modify the pharmacokinetics and side effects of crizotinib by altering drug efflux from cells. While these pharmacogenetic interactions are supported by enzyme and transporter roles, specific clinical guidelines or recommendations regarding genotyping before treatment with crizotinib are currently limited, emphasizing the need for further research in this area to optimize individual therapy.
