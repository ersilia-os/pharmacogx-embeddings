## Drug Summary
Losartan, also known as Lortaan, is a medication primarily used in the management of hypertension and is classified as an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). It was approved by the FDA on April 14, 1995. Losartan specifically blocks the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor, which prevents angiotensin II from inducing vasoconstriction, thereby lowering blood pressure. It has also been used for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients and to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. Losartan is significantly absorbed upon oral administration, with a bioavailability of about 33% and reaches peak plasma concentrations within one hour. Its pharmacokinetics exhibits a reduction in peak concentration when taken with food, though the overall absorption (AUC) is barely affected. Losartan is metabolized primarily in the liver involving both oxidation and glucuronidation.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary pharmacological target of Losartan is the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor (AGTR1), which it inhibits, leading to relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and decrease in blood pressure. The metabolism of Losartan involves cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, chiefly CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent, CYP2C19 and CYP2C8. It also involves glucuronidation by several UDP-glucuronosyltransferases such as UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A10, UGT2B7, and UGT2B17. Transport processes associated with Losartan include P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), solute carrier family members (SLC22A6, SLC22A12, SLC2A9), and the bile salt export pump (ABCB11). Additionally, it is carried by serum albumin (ALB).

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors play a critical role in the variability of responses and adverse effects seen in patients taking Losartan. Individuals with variants in the CYP2C9 gene can exhibit altered metabolism of Losartan, which could affect drug levels and efficacy. For example, CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles are associated with reduced enzymatic activity which may lead to higher plasma levels of Losartan, thus increasing the risk of adverse reactions. Also, genetic variations in the AGTR1 gene could influence individual responses to Losartan, although specific allele impacts are not as well documented and may warrant further genetic association studies. Variation in transporter genes such as ABCB1 might affect the pharmacokinetics of the drug, particularly its distribution and clearance. These pharmacogenetic associations highlight the importance of personalized medicine approaches in the optimization of Losartan therapy for hypertension and its associated disorders.
