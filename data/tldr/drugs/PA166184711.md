## Drug Summary
Mephedrone, also known as 4-methyl methcathinone (4-MMC) or 4-methylephedrone, does not have a specific therapeutic classification due to its primary use as a recreational drug rather than for medical treatment. This synthetic stimulant is part of the cathinone class, derived from the khat plant. Mephedrone produces effects similar to MDMA, amphetamines, and cocaine. It has been investigated in the context of alcohol-related and amphetamine-related disorders, although there is no established medical indication for its use. Details on its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are limited, and it generally remains under-studied in formal clinical settings due to its legal status and association with substance abuse.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
There is a lack of detailed information available in DrugBank regarding the specific biological targets, enzymes, transporters, or carriers affected by mephedrone. In the broader scientific context, mephedrone is known to act primarily on the monoamine neurotransmitter systems, suggesting it enhances the release and inhibits the reuptake of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. However, definitive identification of specific receptor or enzyme interactions requires further experimental study and verification.

## Pharmacogenetics
Given the limited clinically oriented research on mephedrone, there are no well-established pharmacogenetic profiles that predict its pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic responses. Nonetheless, its mechanism — affecting monoamine neurotransmitter systems — may suggest that polymorphisms in genes related to these neurotransmitters or their transporters, like SLC6A4 (serotonin transporter), could influence individual responses to the drug. This is conjectural and should be proven through targeted genetic studies aimed at understanding how genetic variability affects the response to mephedrone. As of now, no specific pharmacogenetic data from large-scale studies are available to guide personalized interventions with this substance.
