## Drug Summary
Disopyramide, also known under brand names such as Dicorantil, Isorythm, Lispine, and Ritmodan, is a Class Ia antiarrhythmic agent. It is primarily used for the treatment of serious ventricular arrhythmias like sustained ventricular tachycardia. Disopyramide acts as a membrane-stabilizing agent by interfering with cardiac membrane depolarization. It exhibits anticholinergic and local anesthetic properties. The drug achieves its antiarrhythmic effects by inhibiting fast sodium channels, which influences several aspects of cardiac electrical activity, notably lengthening the effective refractory period of the atrium and altering conduction in accessory pathways. Disopyramide is almost completely absorbed when administered and is metabolized in the liver.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Disopyramide acts on multiple protein targets including sodium channel protein type 5 subunit alpha (SCN5A), as well as muscarinic acetylcholine receptors M1 to M3 (CHRM1, CHRM2, CHRM3). It also affects potassium voltage-gated channels including KCND2, KCND3, and KCNH2. These interactions underpin its effects on cardiac ion channels and neurotransmitter pathways influencing heart rhythm and conduction. Disopyramide is metabolized mainly by cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, and transported by solute carriers SLC22A1 and SLC22A2. Additionally, it is carried by alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1).

## Pharmacogenetics
Disopyramide pharmacokinetics and response can be influenced by genetic variability in its metabolic pathways, particularly involving CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 enzymes. Variants in these genes can affect drug metabolism rates, potentially altering efficacy and toxicity. For example, individuals with certain CYP1A2 genotypes may experience slower metabolism of disopyramide, leading to higher plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse effects. However, specific associations with pharmacogenetic markers are not abundantly documented in the literature but could bear resemblance to those observed with other drugs metabolized through similar pathways. It is possible that further pharmacogenetic testing could help optimize dosing and reduce side effects in patients treated with disopyramide, though current clinical guidelines specific to pharmacogenetics for disopyramide use are not established.
