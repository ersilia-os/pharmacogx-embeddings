## Drug Summary
Daunorubicin, also known by several other names including Cerubidin and Cérubidine, is an anthracycline antibiotic and antineoplastic agent used primarily for the treatment of various types of leukemia, including acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia in both adults and children. The drug is isolated from the bacterium *Streptomyces peucetius* and acts by intercalating DNA, inhibiting topoisomerase II, which impairs DNA replication and transcription. Due to its mechanism, daunorubicin is associated with several serious toxicities such as cytopenias, hepatotoxicity, extravasation reactions, and notably, dose-related cardiotoxicity. Pharmacodynamically, it has a max concentration (Cmax) of 24.8 μg/mL after a 90-minute infusion.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Daunorubicin targets DNA topoisomerase 2-alpha (TOP2A) and DNA topoisomerase 2-beta (TOP2B), crucial enzymes in DNA replication and transcription processes. The drug's metabolism and activity involve several cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP1B1, as well as other enzymes like POR (NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase), AKR1B1 (Aldose reductase), CBR1, and CBR3 (Carbonyl reductases). These enzymes are involved in the biotransformation of daunorubicin, affecting its pharmacokinetics and potential toxicity. Key transporters associated with daunorubicin include ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), ABCC1 (Multidrug resistance-associated protein 1), ABCC10, ABCG2, and ABCC6, which are involved in drug efflux and can impact drug resistance and distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of daunorubicin involve significant interactions linked to variations in genes encoding for drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Variants of the CYP1B1 gene, such as rs10932125, have been associated with increased risk of cytotoxicity upon daunorubicin treatment. Likewise, polymorphisms in HNRNPD, SEC14L3, and IKBKE have been linked to enhanced drug-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, variations such as rs2229774 in RARG, rs7853758 in SLC28A3, and rs17863783 in UGT1A6 are particularly noteworthy in pediatrics, as they may increase the risk of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity, which is a critical concern in daunorubicin therapy. Understanding these genetic associations is crucial for tailoring chemotherapy and managing potential adverse effects in specific patient populations.
