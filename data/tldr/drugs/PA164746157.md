## Drug Summary
Mitotane, also known by trade names Lisodren and Opeprim, is an adrenolytic agent derived from the insecticide DDD and a metabolite of DDT. It has been utilized since 1959 primarily for the treatment of inoperable adrenocortical carcinoma, as well as off-label for managing Cushing's syndrome. The drug operates by inhibiting adrenal cortex cells and altering steroid metabolism, thereby decreasing plasma levels of certain corticosteroids while increasing others. Mitotane is characterized by a 40% oral bioavailability and undergoes extensive hepatic and extrahepatic metabolism, primarily to a metabolite known as o,pâ€™-DDA. It also exhibits significant lipophilicity, complicating its clearance from the body, especially in overdose scenarios which may elicit symptoms like sedation and vertigo.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Mitotane targets several key receptors and enzymes related to steroid metabolism and hormone action. It interacts with mitochondrial cytochrome P450 11B1 (CYP11B1), and it also has affinity for nuclear hormone receptors including the estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1), progesterone receptor (PGR), and androgen receptor (AR). Furthermore, it affects adrenodoxin (FDX1), crucial in adrenal steroid biosynthesis. The metabolism of mitotane involves primarily cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7. These enzymes significantly modulate its pharmacokinetic profile. Mitotane is also a substrate of the transporter P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and binds to carriers like thyroxine-binding globulin (SERPINA7), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and corticosteroid-binding globulin (SERPINA6), impacting its distribution and effects.

## Pharmacogenetics
Mitotane's pharmacogenetic interactions are primarily mediated through its metabolism by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Variations in these genes may affect the individual's ability to metabolize mitotane, potentially influencing both efficacy and toxicity of the drug. For instance, polymorphisms in CYP3A5 that impact enzyme activity could alter mitotane levels and its therapeutic outcomes. Since mitotane is a substrate for ABCB1, genetic variants affecting the expression or function of this transporter could also modify the drug's pharmacokinetics and toxicity profile. The involvement of sex hormone-binding globulins and thyroxine-binding globulin as carriers suggests that variations in genes encoding these proteins could influence how mitotane is distributed and acts in the body. Although specific pharmacogenetic guidelines for mitotane are limited, considering these genetic factors may be critical for optimizing therapy and managing side effects in patients treated with this medication.
