## Drug Summary
Ephedrine, known under commercial names such as Rezipres, is a sympathomimetic amine derived from the ephedra plant. It prominently acts as both a direct and indirect agonist of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors which stimulates the sympathetic nervous system. It induces a range of physiological responses including increased blood pressure, heart rate, and bronchodilation. It is primarily indicated for treating hypotension during anesthesia, allergic conditions like bronchial asthma, and as an over-the-counter nasal decongestant. Ephedrine has a rapid absorption with high bioavailability and is mostly excreted unmetabolized, with minor metabolism to norephedrine and other metabolites.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Ephedrine targets several adrenergic receptors: ADRA1A (Alpha-1A adrenergic receptor), ADRB1 (Beta-1 adrenergic receptor), and ADRB2 (Beta-2 adrenergic receptor), enhancing vascular resistance, cardiac output, and bronchodilation respectively. It also interacts with the SLC6A2 (Sodium-dependent noradrenaline transporter), inhibiting norepinephrine reuptake which results in increased synaptic concentrations of norepinephrine. Ephedrineâ€™s metabolism involves minor oxidative pathways facilitated by enzymes such as BCHE (Cholinesterase) and ACHE (Acetylcholinesterase). Transport of ephedrine involves the SLC18A2 (Synaptic vesicular amine transporter), and it is also known to bind to carriers like ALB (Serum albumin).

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic aspects of ephedrine handling in the body primarily involve its interaction with adrenergic receptors and transport mechanisms which can vary between individuals due to genetic variations. However, specific pharmacogenetic data for ephedrine regarding gene-drug interactions or impacts of genetic variations on its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are not extensively documented in typical databases like PharmGKB or in broader literature. Given ephedrine's mechanism involving adrenergic receptors and noradrenaline transporters, genetic variants in genes related to these proteins (e.g., ADRA1A, ADRB1, ADRB2, SLC6A2) could potentially influence individual responses to the drug. More detailed research would likely be needed to clarify these associations and offer personalized therapeutic strategies based on genetic makeup.
