## Drug Summary
Urofollitropin, also known under the brand names Fertinex and Metrodin, is a purified form of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) derived from human urine. It is primarily used to treat female infertility, particularly in procedures such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT). Urofollitropin functions by stimulating the growth of ovarian follicles in women who do not have primary ovarian failure, helping to induce ovulation when used in conjunction with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The drug is administered subcutaneously and exhibits a notable absorption rate of approximately 74%. Its pharmacodynamics highlight its role in stimulating follicular recruitment and development by acting directly on the ovarian cells.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Urofollitropin exerts its effect by targeting the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), a G-protein-coupled transmembrane receptor. Upon binding to this receptor, FSH triggers a cascade that involves the phosphorylation and activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, a critical mechanism for cellular functions related to metabolic regulation and follicular maturation and survival. The pharmacological action is restricted to this pathway with no additional enzymes, transporters, or carriers implicated in the drug's mechanism of action, metabolism, or distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there is limited specific pharmacogenetic data about urofollitropin. The drugâ€™s effectiveness and safety profile may vary among women based on genetic differences that affect FSHR expression or function. Variations in the FSHR gene might alter the receptor's sensitivity or responsiveness to FSH, potentially influencing the clinical outcomes of fertility treatments that utilize urofollitropin. However, detailed studies and genomic data are required to establish clearer pharmacogenetic guidelines and to possibly predict responsiveness to this therapy in infertility treatments.
