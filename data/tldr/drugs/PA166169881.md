## Drug Summary
Deutetrabenazine, marketed under the trade name Austedo, is a VMAT2 inhibitor used for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington's disease and tardive dyskinesia in adults. This drug is a deuterated derivative of tetrabenazine and exhibits prolonged pharmacological activity due to attenuated CYP2D6 metabolism, leading to less frequent dosing and potentially improved tolerability. Its primary action involves the reversible depletion of monoamines such as dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and histamine from nerve terminals, thus alleviating symptoms of hyperkinetic movement disorders. Deutetrabenazine has shown effectiveness in clinical trials by decreasing chorea symptoms and involuntary movements in patients, underlining its therapeutic efficacy. Notably, the drug is extensively metabolized in the liver and is well-absorbed orally, achieving peak plasma concentrations in approximately 3-4 hours after dosing.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Deutetrabenazine acts primarily by inhibiting the VMAT2 (SLC18A2), which is crucial for the uptake of neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles, effectively reducing neurotransmitter availability and activity. This action is pivotal in its therapeutic effect in movement disorders. It is metabolized predominantly through hepatic mechanisms; key enzymes include carbonyl reductase enzymes CBR1 and CBR3, as well as several cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4/5). These enzymes contribute to the formation of active metabolites, α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ, which are crucial to the drug's activity. No specific transporters or carriers were noted to be involved in the absorption or distribution of deutetrabenazine according to the provided data.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of Deutetrabenazine is significantly influenced by genetic variants in the CYP2D6 enzyme, a primary pathway of its metabolism. Variability in the CYP2D6 gene can alter drug metabolism rates, impacting both the efficacy and adverse effect profile of the drug. Patients with reduced function or non-functional alleles could experience greater exposure to Deutetrabenazine, potentially leading to increased side effects, whereas those with increased function alleles might require higher doses to achieve therapeutic effects. While specific pharmacogenomic testing recommendations for deutetrabenazine have not been established, assessing CYP2D6 variants could be considered to personalize dosing and mitigate risk, especially given the critical role of this pathway in the drug's metabolism.
