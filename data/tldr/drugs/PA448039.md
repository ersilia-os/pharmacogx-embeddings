## Drug Summary
Acitretin, commercially known as Neotigason, is an oral retinoid primarily used for the treatment of severe psoriasis in adults. It acts as a major metabolite of etretinate but has the advantage of a shorter half-life, enhancing its safety profile compared to etretinate. Acitretin's pharmacodynamics involve modulating the growth and differentiation of skin cells by mimicking the effects similar to those of vitamin A. Its mechanism, though not completely understood, is suggested to involve interaction with specific retinoid receptors in the skin, leading to normalization of skin cell growth cycles. The drug shows optimal oral absorption when administered with food, and its bioavailability exhibits linear and proportional characteristics with increasing doses. It undergoes extensive metabolism which includes isomerization and breakdown into smaller metabolites, followed by excretion.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Acitretin targets several retinoid receptors which include RXR-alpha (RXRA), RXR-beta (RXRB), RXR-gamma (RXRG), retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA), beta (RARB), and gamma (RARG). These receptors play crucial roles in mediating the effects of acitretin on skin cell growth and differentiation. Moreover, the drug also interacts with the retinol-binding protein 1 (RBP1) and is transported by serum albumin (ALB), which could influence its distribution and bioavailability within the body. There is no specified involvement of particular enzymes or transporters in its metabolic or excretory pathways according to the existing data.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there is no specific pharmacogenetic data provided for acitretin in the DrugBank or PharmGKB repositories related to variation in patient responses based on gene differences. However, given the involvement of multiple retinoid receptors (RARA, RARB, RARG, RXRA, RXRB, RXRG) which are genetically controlled and could vary between individuals, genetic variations in these receptors or their signaling pathways could potentially influence the efficacy and safety of acitretin. Further pharmacogenetic research could enlighten strategies for personalized dosing or avoidance of adverse effects in specific populations.
