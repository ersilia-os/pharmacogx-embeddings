## Drug Summary
Theophylline is a methylxanthine derivative primarily used to treat asthma, bronchospasm, and other chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Chemically related to caffeine and theobromine, theophylline functions as a bronchodilator by relaxing smooth muscles in the bronchial tubes, thereby aiding in easier breathing. It acts through multiple mechanisms, notably as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor to prevent the breakdown of cyclic AMP, as an adenosine receptor blocker (minimizing bronchoconstriction), and as an activator of histone deacetylase which curtails the transcription of inflammatory genes. Theophylline is rapidly absorbed when administered orally and is primarily metabolized in the liver through demethylation and hydroxylation, leading to various metabolites, including caffeine.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Theophylline interacts with several molecular targets that influence its therapeutic effects, including adenosine receptors (ADORA1, ADORA2A, ADORA2B) and various isoforms of phosphodiesterase (PDE3A, PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE5A), which play roles in smooth muscle tone and inflammatory responses. It also affects histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), influencing gene expression. Enzymatically, theophylline is metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. These enzymes are crucial in the hepatic biotransformation of theophylline into less active forms, detailing an extensive interaction with the bodyâ€™s metabolic systems. Theophylline is also transported by solute carrier family 22 member 7 (SLC22A7).

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of theophylline is particularly highlighted by its interactions with the CYP1A2 enzyme. Genetic variants within the CYP1A2 gene can lead to altered enzyme activity, significantly affecting the metabolism and clearance of theophylline from the body. Patients carrying specific genotypes that reduce CYP1A2 activity may experience slower metabolism of theophylline, potentially leading to increased risk of toxicity. These pharmacogenetic considerations are crucial for dosing adjustments and the management of side effects, particularly in populations with genetic predispositions that alter enzyme efficiency. This highlights the importance of genetic testing or consideration of patient-specific genetic backgrounds in the therapeutic use of theophylline.
