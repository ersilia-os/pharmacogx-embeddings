## Drug Summary
Mephenytoin is a hydantoin derivative anticonvulsant medication primarily used for the treatment of refractory partial epilepsy. It belongs to the phenylhydantoins class and is chemically characterized by an imidazolidinedione moiety substituted with a phenyl group, forming a solid compound. Mephenytoin functions by modulating neuronal activity, primarily in the motor cortex, which is crucial for managing epilepsy. The drug achieves this by promoting sodium efflux from neurons, hence stabilizing the membrane threshold against hyperexcitability and inhibiting the spread of seizure activity. It reduces the maximal activity of brain stem centers responsible for the tonic phase of tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures. Although the exact molecular mechanism isn't fully defined, it is speculated to involve the blockage of sodium channels, limiting repetitive firing of action potentials.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Mephenytoin's primary pharmacological target is the sodium channel protein type 5 subunit alpha (SCN5A). This channel is critical in controlling neuronal excitability and firing. Additionally, the drug interacts with the nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 2 (NR1I2), possibly affecting drug metabolism regulatory pathways. It is metabolized predominantly by several cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP2C19, CYP2B6, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C9, which play a significant role in its biotransformation. Mephenytoin is also known to interact with carriers like thyroxine-binding globulin (SERPINA7), although the clinical significance of this interaction is not fully elucidated.

## Pharmacogenetics
Mephenytoin pharmacogenetics is significantly influenced by genetic variations in the CYP2C19 enzyme. Notably, several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CYP2C19 gene, such as rs4986893, rs41291556, and rs72558186, are associated with altered drug metabolism. Patients harboring these mutations exhibit reduced metabolism of mephenytoin, which can lead to variations in drug efficacy, increased risk of adverse effects, or therapy failure. Genetic testing prior to mephenytoin administration might be considered to optimize dosing and minimize potential drug-related toxicities. This pharmacogenetic information is crucial for personalized treatment approaches in epilepsy management, ensuring patients receive the most effective and safest therapeutic strategies based on their genetic profile.
