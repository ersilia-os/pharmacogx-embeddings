## Drug Summary
Hydroxybupropion is the primary active metabolite of bupropion, which is an atypical antidepressant primarily used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD) and to support smoking cessation. Bupropion is marketed under various brand names, including Wellbutrin and Zyban. Hydroxybupropion contributes significantly to the therapeutic effects of bupropion due to its longer half-life and similar mechanism of action. This metabolite acts as a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), enhancing the neurotransmission of norepinephrine and dopamine. Additionally, it has minimal effects on the serotonin system, distinguishing it from other types of antidepressants. The medication is primarily metabolized in the liver, with hydroxybupropion being formed via CYP2B6.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
While specific target information for hydroxybupropion itself is not well-documented, it is understood that its pharmacodynamic properties closely mirror those of its parent compound, bupropion. Bupropion and by extension hydroxybupropion act by inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine, thus increasing their availability and activity in the synaptic cleft. The metabolic transformation of bupropion to hydroxybupropion is primarily mediated by the enzyme CYP2B6 in the liver. Details on specific transporters or carriers directly interacting with hydroxybupropion are not prevalent, but these would be expected to align closely with those relevant to bupropion.

## Pharmacogenetics
Hydroxybupropion's formation and elimination are influenced by genetic polymorphisms in the CYP2B6 gene. Variability in this gene can affect the plasma levels of hydroxybupropion, thereby influencing both efficacy and the risk of adverse effects. Certain CYP2B6 alleles, such as CYP2B6*6, have been associated with a decreased enzymatic activity, leading to slower metabolism of bupropion and potentially higher concentrations of hydroxybupropion. This variability can affect clinical responses and side effect profiles among different individuals. Additionally, while specific studies on hydroxybupropion are limited, the genetic variations impacting bupropion pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are likely relevant to its metabolite as well.
