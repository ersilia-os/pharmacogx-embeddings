## Drug Summary
Itraconazole, also known by brand names such as Itrizole, Oriconazole, and Sporal, is a broad-spectrum triazole antifungal agent that was first synthesized in the 1980s and approved in the US in 1992. It is used to treat various fungal infections including blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, aspergillosis, and onychomycosis in both immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients. The drug works by inhibiting fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme 14Î±-demethylase, which is crucial for converting lanosterol to ergosterol, thereby damaging the fungal cell membrane. Itraconazole is administered orally, with an oral solution and capsule formulation available. The drug exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics with steady-state concentrations typically reached within 15 days.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Itraconazole's primary target is the enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase (coded by the gene ERG11) in fungi, disrupting ergosterol synthesis and fungal cell membrane integrity. In humans, its metabolism involves primarily the cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly CYP3A4, along with CYP3A5, CYP3A7, CYP2B6, CYP1A1, and CYP2E1. This extensive metabolism leads to several metabolites, with hydroxyitraconazole being the major one possessing similar antifungal properties as the parent compound. Itraconazole and its metabolites are also substrates for transporters such as P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), ABCG2, and the solute carrier organic anion transporter SLCO2B1. Additionally, serum albumin (ALB) acts as a carrier protein for the drug in the bloodstream.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of itraconazole mainly involves the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Given the central role of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 in its metabolism, genetic variants in these genes can significantly impact the pharmacokinetics and consequently the efficacy and toxicity of itraconazole. For example, individuals harboring certain alleles of CYP3A5 may exhibit altered enzyme activity leading to differences in drug levels. Furthermore, since itraconazole is a substrate for the efflux transporter ABCB1, genetic variations in the ABCB1 gene could affect drug bioavailability and disposition, potentially modifying therapeutic outcomes or adverse effects. This highlights the importance of considering genetic factors in the dosing and administration of itraconazole to optimize its antifungal efficacy while minimizing risks of toxicity.
