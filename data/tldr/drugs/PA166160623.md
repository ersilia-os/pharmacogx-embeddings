## Drug Summary
Thioguanine, metabolized into the active form thioguanine nucleotides such as thioguanosine monophosphate (thio-GMP), is an antineoplastic medication used primarily in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It belongs to the class of drugs known as purine analogs, which are designed to interfere with DNA synthesis. Thioguanine is administered orally and undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism. Its pharmacokinetics involve conversion into active thioguanine nucleotides via the purine salvage pathway. The drug has a complex pharmacodynamic profile, exerting its cytotoxic effects by incorporating into DNA and RNA, thereby disrupting these crucial cellular processes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
As the thioguanosine monophosphate is an active metabolite rather than a drug administered directly, specific data on transporters, carriers, and additional enzyme interactions are limited. However, it is known that thioguanine is metabolized by the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) to form thioguanosine monophosphate. This pathway is crucial for the transformation into further phosphorylated forms that can be incorporated into DNA and RNA. 

## Pharmacogenetics
Thioguanine's efficacy and safety are influenced by genetic variations in several genes related to its metabolic pathways. Key genetic associations concern the activity of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X-type motif 15 (NUDT15) genes, which are well-documented to affect thiopurine metabolism. Variants in TPMT and NUDT15 can lead to either excessive or insufficient drug activation, impacting both the therapeutic effectiveness and risk of toxicity. Testing for TPMT and NUDT15 variants is recommended in clinical guidelines prior to initiating therapy with thioguanine to tailor doses for optimal efficacy and minimized adverse effects. Additionally, the role of other enzymes like xanthine oxidase (XO) in drug metabolism may also have pharmacogenetic relevance, although further studies are needed to firmly establish these relationships.
