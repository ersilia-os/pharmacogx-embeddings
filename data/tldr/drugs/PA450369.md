## Drug Summary
Meperidine, also known by various brand names such as Dolantin, Dolosal, and others, is a synthetic opioid analgesic belonging to the phenylpiperidine class. It is primarily used to control moderate to severe pain, including postoperative pain and labor pain. Meperidine acts as a kappa-opioid receptor agonist with local anesthetic effects and is structurally similar to local anesthetics. Notably, the onset of action for Meperidine is slightly more rapid than morphine, and it has a shorter duration of action. Pharmaceutically, meperidine is less potent when taken orally due to significant first-pass hepatic metabolism, which also leads to a metabolite called normeperidine that has CNS stimulating properties but lower analgesic potency.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Meperidine primarily targets opioid receptors, specifically the kappa-type (OPRK1) and mu-type (OPRM1) receptors, which modulate pain perception and other physiological functions. It also impacts various neurotransmitter systems by interacting with ionotropic glutamate receptors (GRIN1, GRIN2B, GRIN2A, GRIN2C, GRIN2D) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM2, CHRM3, CHRM4, CHRM5). For metabolism, Meperidine is primarily processed in the liver with the involvement of multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes, notably CYP3A4, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2. It is a substrate for the transporter P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1) and is carried by proteins such as serum albumin (ALB) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (ORM1).

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors play a considerable role in the metabolism of Meperidine. Variants in the cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2D6, can significantly affect the drugâ€™s metabolism and the patient's response. Poor metabolizers in the CYP2D6 gene may experience enhanced or prolonged effects of meperidine, while rapid metabolizers may require higher doses for effective pain control. Additionally, genetic variations in CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 could also influence meperidine metabolism, impacting efficacy and toxicity. Moreover, polymorphisms in opioid receptor genes like OPRM1 and OPRK1 may alter analgesic efficacy and the risk of developing side effects or dependence. Further research may elucidate additional pharmacogenetic interactions that could inform personalized medicine approaches in the use of meperidine and similar opioid analgesics.
