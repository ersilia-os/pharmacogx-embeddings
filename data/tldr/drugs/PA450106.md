## Drug Summary
Isoflurane, also known as Aerrane, Forene, Isocane, and Isorane, is a widely used inhalation anesthetic. It is particularly noted for its stability, non-explosiveness, and minimal side effects, making it a good choice for both the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. Mechanistically, isoflurane alters tissue excitability, inducing muscle relaxation and reducing pain sensitivity. This is achieved through its effects on gap junction mediated cell-cell coupling and various channel activities that govern action potentials. Isoflurane acts primarily by reducing junctional conductance and affecting the fluidity of lipid membranes, which impacts calcium transport and ATP synthesis. The drugâ€™s pharmacokinetics detail a negligible extent of absorption given its administration route (inhalation) and it undergoes minimal metabolism.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Isoflurane interacts with a variety of molecular targets including multiple subunits of the GABA(A) receptor (like GABRA1, GABRA2, and GABRG2), which is indicative of its role in enhancing inhibitory neurotransmission leading to sedation and anesthetic effects. Additionally, the drug interacts with neuronal acetylcholine receptors (such as CHRNA4 and CHRNB2), glutamate receptors (GRIA1), and glycine receptors (GLRA1), all of which play roles in neural signaling and response modulation. Isoflurane also affects ion channels like the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 1 (KCNA1), influencing neuronal excitability and action potentials. Enzymatic interactions include minimal metabolism by cytochromes like CYP2B6 and CYP2E1, and it is carrier-mediated by proteins such as serum albumin (ALB). The broad spectrum of interactions of isoflurane with various ion channels and receptors underlies its effective and adjustable anesthetic properties.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of isoflurane primarily revolves around its interaction with genetically variable targets like GABA receptor subunits and cytochrome P450 enzymes which may influence individual responses to the anesthesia. For instance, variations in GABA receptor subunits could alter the sensitivity to isoflurane, impacting the dose needed to achieve desired anesthetic effects. Variants in CYP2E1 and CYP2B6 might affect the rate of metabolic processing of isoflurane, although its metabolism is generally minimal, potentially moderating its pharmacokinetic profile. Given the lack of extensive pharmacogenomic data directly linking gene variants to clinical outcomes with isoflurane, any associations remain inferred rather than explicitly established, warranting cautious interpretation and further research.
