## Drug Summary
Misoprostol, also known by its trade name Isprelor, is a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog primarily used to prevent gastric ulcers associated with NSAID use and to manage gynecological conditions such as miscarriage and post-partum hemorrhage. Furthermore, it's used either alone or in combination with mifepristone for first trimester abortions in various regions. Approved by the FDA on 27 December 1988, misoprostol acts by mimicking prostaglandin E1, which not only reduces gastric acid secretion by binding to prostaglandin receptors in the stomach but also increases uterine contractions and softens the cervix which is vital for its gynecologic utilities. The drug is absorbed differently based on its route of administration, achieving variable peak plasma concentrations and bioavailability.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Misoprostol targets several prostaglandin E2 receptor subtypes: PTGER1, PTGER2, PTGER3, and PTGER4, which are located in various tissues including the stomach and uterus. By stimulating these receptors, misoprostol reduces gastric acid secretion and increases the thickness of the gastric mucosal bilayer, encouraging cell regeneration. It also enhances uterine contractions and cervical remodeling by stimulating the receptors on the uterine smooth muscle. There are no enzymatic breakdowns specified, nor are there any identified transporters or carriers associated with the action or metabolism of misoprostol, as it mainly undergoes de-esterification into active metabolites like misoprostol acid in various tissues.

## Pharmacogenetics
While the pharmacogenetic profile of misoprostol is not extensively documented, inference can be made based on its mechanism of action. Given the drugâ€™s action on prostaglandin receptors, genetic variations in genes encoding these receptors (e.g., PTGER1-4) could potentially influence individual responses to misoprostol, affecting both efficacy and side effects. This area, however, appears underexplored and warrants further clinical and genetic studies to better understand genetic influences on the drug's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, especially in its role in induced labor and abortion, where variability in drug response can have significant outcomes.
