## Drug Summary
Pitolisant, marketed under the trade name Wakix, is a selective antagonist or inverse agonist of the histamine H3 receptor. It is used for treating narcolepsy with or without cataplexy in adults, manifesting as excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy in the United States and is approved for patients aged six years and older. Pitolisant enhances wakefulness and daytime alertness by inhibiting presynaptic histamine H3 receptors in the brain, subsequently increasing histaminergic neuron activity and neurotransmitter signaling. This action helps in alleviating symptoms of narcolepsy, particularly improving sleepiness levels and wakefulness as assessed by clinical scales like the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The drug is absorbed well orally, with its absorption peaking around three hours after administration and achieving steady plasma concentrations after repeated dosing.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Pitolisant acts primarily on the Histamine H3 receptor (HRH3), acting as a high-affinity competitive antagonist or inverse agonist, enhancing histamine signaling. Another reported target is the Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2 (KCNH2), involved in cardiac repolarization. Pitolisant is metabolized primarily by Cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP2D6 predominantly, and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4, with additional involvement of CYP1A2 and CYP2B6. These enzymes convert pitolisant into various metabolites, mostly inactive. The drug's pharmacokinetics also involves transporters like the Solute carrier family 22 member 1 (SLC22A1), and protein carriers such as Serum albumin (ALB) and Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1), which may influence its distribution and excretion.

## Pharmacogenetics
Given Pitolisant's primary metabolism by CYP2D6, polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 gene significantly influence its pharmacokinetics and individual patient responses. Variants in CYP2D6 can lead to poor, intermediate, extensive, or ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes, affecting the drug's efficacy and side-effect profile. For instance, poor metabolizers might experience heightened exposure to pitolisant, leading to increased adverse effects, while ultrarapid metabolizers might require higher doses for therapeutic efficacy. These genotype-dependent differences necessitate careful consideration of dose adjustments or alternative therapies based on genetic testing. While detailed pharmacogenomic data specific to pitolisant are somewhat limited, these inferences are consistent with the known impact of CYP2D6 variability on other medications metabolized by this enzyme.
