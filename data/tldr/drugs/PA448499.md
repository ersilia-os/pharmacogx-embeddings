## Drug Summary
Atenolol, also known under the trade names Myocord and Normiten, is a cardioselective beta-blocker primarily used in the treatment of cardiovascular conditions including hypertension, angina pectoris, and certain types of arrhythmias. Atenolol selectively inhibits the Î²1-adrenergic receptors in the heart, significantly reducing the heart's demand for oxygen by decreasing heart rate and contractility. This action is especially beneficial in angina by reducing myocardial oxygen consumption. Developed by Alvogen Malta and approved by the FDA in 1981, atenolol has a modest effect in reducing cardiovascular disease risk and mortality in hypertensive patients and shows variation in effectiveness based on patient age. The drug is absorbed about 50% after oral administration and metabolization is minimal, mainly excreted unchanged through the kidneys.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Atenolol acts predominantly on the Beta-1 adrenergic receptor (ADRB1), with lesser affinity for the Beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2), facilitating its cardioselective properties. The drug's interaction with ADRB1 reduces cardiac output by decreasing the rate and force of heart contractions, and it slightly affects ADRB2 which can lead to bronchoconstriction, albeit much less than non-selective beta-blockers. Atenolol is minimally metabolized in the liver, primarily involving the hydroxylation mediated by CYP2D6. The drug is also associated with the transport protein ABCB11 (Bile salt export pump) and binds to serum albumin (ALB), which can influence its distribution and excretion.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic aspects of atenolol involve the gene symbol ADRB1, specifically the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1801253. Patients with certain genotypes at this SNP experience a greater reduction in blood pressure when treated with atenolol, indicating a personalized response based on genetic makeup. Additionally, variations in the CYP2D6 enzyme could potentially affect the metabolism of atenolol, although the impact is likely minimal given the drug's low extent of metabolism in the liver. Due to its pharmacogenetics profile, atenolol's efficacy and safety can vary, suggesting that genotyping could be beneficial in optimizing treatment for individual patients.
