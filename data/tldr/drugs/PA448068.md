## Drug Summary
Salbutamol, also known as albuterol in the US, is a selective beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist primarily used for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It functions by selectively targeting the beta2 receptors in the lungs, promoting bronchodilation and thereby alleviating symptoms of bronchospasm such as wheezing and shortness of breath. The drug is presented as a racemic mixture of R- and S-isomers; the R-isomer being more effective in bronchodilation while the S-isomer may contribute to adverse effects. Salbutamol has a rapid onset of action, generally providing relief within 5 to 15 minutes of inhalation, with effects lasting 3 to 6 hours. It is metabolized primarily in the liver into inactive sulphate esters and is excreted largely in the urine.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Salbutamol primarily acts on the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2), facilitating the relaxation of bronchial muscles. It also exhibits minor activity on beta-1 (ADRB1) and beta-3 (ADRB3) adrenergic receptors, which can lead to some cardiovascular effects such as an increase in heart rate. From a pharmacokinetic perspective, salbutamol is metabolized mainly by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) in the liver. There are no significant interactions with transporters or carriers according to the data provided.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, variability in response to salbutamol can be attributed to genetic differences in the ADRB2 gene among individuals. Certain polymorphisms in ADRB2, such as the Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu, have been studied for their impact on the bronchodilatory effects of salbutamol. These variants can influence the binding affinity or the downregulation dynamics of the receptor in response to agonists. However, the clinical implications of these genetic variations are still subject to ongoing research, and the association between these polymorphisms and therapeutic or adverse outcomes remains to be fully established. Understanding individual genetic predispositions can potentially aid in tailoring asthma management but is not yet a routine part of clinical practice.
