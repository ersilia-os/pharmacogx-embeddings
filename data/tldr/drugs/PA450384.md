## Drug Summary
Mesalazine, also known under brand names like Asacolitin, Claversal, Fisalamine, Iialda, and Lixacol, is an anti-inflammatory agent primarily used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's ileocolitis. It is structurally related to salicylates and is a component of sulphasalazine, although it is responsible for the therapeutic effects rather than the side effects often associated with sulphasalazine. The drug functions predominantly through a topical mechanism on colonic epithelial cells, inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, reducing leukocyte migration, and acting as a scavenger of free radicals. Mesalazine's absorption varies based on the formulation, and it is metabolized mostly in the liver and intestinal mucosa to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid through NAT-1, with some contribution from colonic bacteria. 

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Mesalazine affects multiple targets including prostaglandin G/H synthases (PTGS1 and PTGS2), which play a role in prostaglandin synthesis, arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5), involved in leukotriene synthesis, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG). It also inhibits factors in the NF-kB pathway (CHUK and IKBKB), reducing the production of key pro-inflammatory cytokines and may inhibit inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2). The primary enzyme involved in the metabolism of mesalazine is arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1). Transporters involved with this drug include solute carrier organic anion transporters SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, and SLCO2B1. There are no specific carriers listed for this drug.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of mesalazine are partly influenced by the activity of the arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) enzyme, which is primarily responsible for its metabolism. Genetic variants in NAT1 can influence the acetylation capacity, hence potentially impacting the drug’s efficacy and tolerance profile. Additionally, genetic responsiveness related to the drug’s targets, particularly PTGS1, PTGS2, and PPARG, could modify the therapeutic outcomes and adverse effects in certain patient subsets. While specific guidance on genotype-based dosing is not commonly provided, individual variations can lead to differences in responses, necessitating careful monitoring and dose adjustments in clinical settings. Further investigations into pharmacogenetic markers may enhance personalized treatment approaches with mesalazine in inflammatory bowel disease therapy.
