## Drug Summary
Doxepin, known under various brand names like Adapin, Aponal, and Quitaxon, is primarily used as an antidepressant and anxiolytic agent. Although often classified alongside tricyclic antidepressants, its unique pharmacological properties set it apart. Approved by the FDA in 1969, its uses extend to treating depression, anxiety, insomnia, and certain skin conditions like pruritus in dermatitis. Doxepin works through multiple mechanisms but is principally known for inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, elevating mood and alleviating symptoms of depression and anxiety. The drug is moderately absorbed with a bioavailability of 30%, reaching peak concentrations in 3.5 hours post-administration. It undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism, predominantly aided by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Doxepin exhibits a broad spectrum of pharmacological interactions by targeting a variety of receptors and transport systems. Notably, it acts on the histamine H1 receptor, which contributes to its sedative and antipruritic properties, and various serotonin and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, enhancing its antidepressant effect. Key neurotransmitter transporters such as the sodium-dependent noradrenaline and serotonin transporters (SLC6A2 and SLC6A4) are also inhibited, which bolsters its action against depression. Enzymatically, Doxepin is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6, CYP2C19, along with minor involvement from CYP1A2 and CYP2C9. The drug is also a substrate for P-glycoprotein, a vital efflux transporter, influencing its cellular distribution and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of Doxepin is significantly influenced by genetic variations in metabolizing enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. Polymorphisms in these genes can drastically affect the drug's metabolism and clearance, leading to variability in therapeutic outcomes and side-effect profiles among individuals. Notable SNPs like rs35742686, rs3892097, rs5030655, and rs28371733 in CYP2D6, and rs4244285 and rs4986893 in CYP2C19, are associated with poor metabolism of Doxepin. This genetic variability can lead to either subtherapeutic effects or increased risks of toxicity in patients, making pharmacogenetic testing potentially beneficial in optimizing Doxepin therapy for individualized treatment.
