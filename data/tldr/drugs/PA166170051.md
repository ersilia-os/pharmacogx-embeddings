## Drug Summary
Valbenazine, marketed under the brand name INGREZZA, is a dopamine-depleting agent predominantly used for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia and chorea associated with Huntington's disease. The drug works by selectively inhibiting vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), thereby regulating monoamine uptake into synaptic vesicles. Valbenazine has shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of these movement disorders, as demonstrated in clinical trials such as the KINECT-HD Phase 3 study. It is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4/5 to produce the active metabolite [+]-α-dihydrotetrabenazine ([+]-α-HTBZ), which also exhibits high affinity for VMAT2. The drug is absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations in about 0.5 to 1.0 hours, with a bioavailability of approximately 49%.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary pharmacological target of valbenazine is the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2, human gene symbol SLC18A2). This protein regulates the storage and release of monoamine neurotransmitters within the nerve terminals. Valbenazine is metabolized predominantly by cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, with further metabolism of its active metabolite by CYP2D6. These enzymes play a significant role in the oxidative metabolism and hydrolysis that transform valbenazine into its active and other minor metabolites. The drug’s pharmacokinetics are not significantly influenced by other transporters or carriers, as significant interactions or involvements have not been documented in the available data.

## Pharmacogenetics
Valbenazine's pharmacological properties and safety profile can vary with genetics, particularly related to enzymatic activity of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5. For instance, individuals who are poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 may experience altered pharmacodynamics, including increased exposure to [+]-α-HTBZ, which has been associated with prolonged QT intervals in some studies. This genetic variation can impact the drug's efficacy and safety, making pharmacogenetic testing potentially beneficial in customizing treatment plans for individual patients. While generic data from population studies with valbenazine is not detailed in the submission, evidence suggests that the effects of common polymorphisms in these enzymes should be considered to optimize dosing and minimize adverse effects. This aligns with the broader trend of considering individual genetic makeup in drug prescribing to enhance both efficacy and safety.
