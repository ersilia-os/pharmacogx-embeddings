## Drug Summary
Furosemide, also sold under brand names like Diurapid, Diurin, Eutensin, and others, is a potent loop diuretic from the anthranilic acid derivatives class. It primarily serves to manage conditions involving fluid overload, such as edema linked to congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and various renal diseases. Furosemide is known for its rapid onset and relatively short duration of action. Administered either orally or intravenously, it is unambiguously aimed at increasing urinary output by inhibiting sodium and chloride reabsorption at different segments of the renal tubular system. Besides its diuretic effect, it also exhibits direct vasodilatory properties, beneficial in conditions like acute pulmonary edema.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Furosemide acts primarily by inhibiting the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter (NKCC2 - encoded by the gene SLC12A1), which is crucial in the sodium transport in the renal thick ascending loop of Henle. These actions not only prevent reabsorption but also facilitate the excretion of multiple ions and water. Additionally, it has a minor action on carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2) and may influence signal pathways through GPR35. Furosemide is metabolized in the liver, to an extent, mainly via glucuronidation facilitated by UGT1A1. It is notably transported by several organic anion transporters including SLC22A6, SLC22A5, and SLC22A8, which affect its excretion and efficacy. It also binds to common plasma proteins like albumin (ALB) and thyroxine-binding globulin (SERPINA7).

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of furosemide isn't as extensively characterized as some other medications, but variations in genes encoding its transporters (e.g., SLC22A6 and SLC22A8) and the metabolic enzyme UGT1A1 could influence its pharmacokinetics and side effects. For instance, genetic variations that reduce the function of these transporters could decrease furosemide clearance, leading to prolonged action or increased risk of adverse effects. Since furosemide is a substrate for UGT1A1, variations in this gene could similarly impact the metabolic clearance of the drug, altering its effectiveness and toxicity profile. These genetic factors warrant consideration when prescribing furosemide, particularly in patients with complex comorbidities or those who are non-responsive to typical doses.
