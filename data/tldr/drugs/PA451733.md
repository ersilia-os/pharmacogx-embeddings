## Drug Summary
Torasemide, sold under names such as Britomar, Diuver, Examide, Luprac, Soaanz, Torem, and Trifas, is classified as a high-ceiling loop diuretic with potent diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive actions, approved by the FDA in 1993. It is primarily used for managing edema associated with congestive heart failure, renal disease, or liver disease, and as an antihypertensive agent either alone or in combination with other medications. Torasemide demonstrates a high oral bioavailability (>80%) that is not impacted by food and has a peak serum concentration around 1 hour post-administration. It is extensively metabolized in the liver, mainly via CYP2C8 and CYP2C9, with approximately 20% of the drug excreted unchanged in the urine.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Torasemide acts on the Na+/K+/Cl- cotransporter in the medullary thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle in the kidneys, primarily by inhibiting SLC12A1 and SLC12A2. Its mechanism includes reducing the reabsorption of sodium, which fosters a potent diuresis and enhances potassium excretion minimally compared to other loop diuretics. It is metabolized primarily by hepatic enzymes CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 leading to several metabolites, with M5 being pharmacologically inactive, and M1 and M3 accounting for a minor portion of its diuretic activity. ALB (serum albumin) acts as a carrier, potentially influencing its distribution, and SLCO1B1 is involved in its transport, suggesting a role in its hepatic uptake.

## Pharmacogenetics
Variations in the genes CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 can significantly affect the metabolism of torasemide. Polymorphisms in these cytochrome P450 enzymes can lead to altered enzyme activity resulting in variations in drug plasma levels, which may necessitate dose adjustments. Specifically, certain alleles of CYP2C9 might decrease metabolic activity, potentially leading to increased exposure to the drug and an elevated risk of adverse effects. However, extensive clinical data specific to torasemide itself may be limited, and such pharmacogenetic implications might be inferred based on knowledge of these enzymes with other substrates. There is no specific genomic data provided for this drug suggesting direct genetic interactions, but the influence of common polymorphisms affecting metabolizing enzyme activities is a critical consideration in personalized medicine approaches for managing diuretic therapy with torasemide.
