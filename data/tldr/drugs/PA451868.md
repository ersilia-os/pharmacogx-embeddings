## Drug Summary
Verapamil, marketed under various brand names such as Isoptin, Calan, and others, belongs to a class of medications known as non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. It is commonly used to treat high blood pressure, different types of angina, and certain heart arrhythmias. Introduced in the early 1960s, verapamil operates by inhibiting L-type calcium channels, though its exact mechanism on cluster headaches, for which it is used off-label, remains partly unclear. Verapamil is a racemic mixture, with the S-enantiomer being more potent yet metabolized faster than the R-enantiomer. The drug's absorption varies by formulation, with immediate-release versions peaking faster but sustained-release forms allowing for more constant levels with less frequent dosing. It undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver, affecting its bioavailability.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Verapamil interacts mainly with various calcium channels (e.g., CACNA1C, CACNA1B, CACNA1A) to exert its therapeutic effects by blocking calcium influx, which influences vascular smooth muscle relaxation and heart rate modulation. Additionally, it affects other targets such as potassium channels (KCNJ11) and adrenergic receptors (ADRA1A, ADRA1B, ADRA1D). Metabolism of verapamil occurs predominantly via CYP enzymes including CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2C8, among others, leading to several active and inactive metabolites. It also interacts with various transporters such as ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) and members of the SLC family, which may influence its distribution and excretion, as well as carriers including ALB and ORM1, which affect its pharmacokinetics by binding and transport.

## Pharmacogenetics
Verapamil's pharmacogenetic profile includes interactions with genes such as CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, pivotal in its metabolism, suggesting variability in therapeutic responses and adverse effects based on individual genetic makeup. Specifically, polymorphisms in these genes can alter enzyme function and thus the metabolism of verapamil, impacting efficacy and toxicity. An example of its pharmacogenetic impact is reflected in the genotype rs1801253 of the ADRB1 gene, where certain variants might require adjustments in verapamil dosage for optimal therapeutic outcomes, particularly in atrial fibrillation management. Further research and genetic testing might provide more personalized verapamil therapy, maximizing benefits while minimizing adverse effects.
