## Drug Summary
Celecoxib, sold under various brand names such as Celebrex, Articox, and Caditar, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) categorized primarily as a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor. This selective inhibition allows for effective management of pain and inflammation with a reduced risk of gastrointestinal side effects commonly associated with other NSAIDs. It is primarily used for the symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other pain conditions, as well as in the reduction of precancerous polyps in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Celecoxib is distinct from traditional NSAIDs as it does not significantly inhibit COX-1, which is beneficial for gastrointestinal safety but still carries risks towards thrombotic cardiovascular events. Pharmacokinetically, celecoxib achieves peak plasma levels within about 3 hours when administered orally, with metabolism predominantly via CYP2C9.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Celecoxib acts by selectively inhibiting the COX-2 enzyme, reducing the synthesis of pro-inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins. Additional targets include Carbonic anhydrases 2 and 3, Cadherin-11 involved in tumor progression, and the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDPK1), hinting at its potential roles in cancer chemoprevention. In terms of enzymes, the major metabolic pathways of celecoxib involve CYP2C9, with contributions from CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and possibly CYP2D6. The transporters associated with celecoxib include P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), Multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (ABCC4), the Bile salt export pump (ABCB11), and ABCG2, which are crucial in modulating drug absorption, distribution, and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
Genetic differences in the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, particularly CYP2C9, play a significant role in the metabolism of celecoxib. The presence of CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles can lead to decreased enzyme activity, influencing the drug's pharmacokinetics and potentially increasing the risk of adverse effects due to higher plasma levels. Individuals carrying variants such as the CYP2C9*3 allele are known to metabolize celecoxib at a slower rate, which may necessitate dosage adjustments to avoid toxicity. Additionally, there might be differential responses based on genetic profiles that impact the expression or function of COX-2 and other drug-related targets. However, clinical guidelines specific to genotype-based dosing for celecoxib are not currently mainstream, underscoring the need for personalized medical approaches in the administration of this drug.
