## Drug Summary
Mianserin, also known under brand names such as Bolvidon, Depnon, Lantanon, Lumin, Norval, and Tolvon, is a tetracyclic antidepressant primarily used for the treatment of depression. Mianserin has antihistaminic and hypnosedative properties and exerts minimal anticholinergic effects. This drug weakly inhibits norepinephrine reuptake and significantly stimulates norepinephrine release. Moreover, mianserin interacts with several serotonin receptors in the central nervous system. Its therapeutic effects generally become noticeable between one to three weeks after initiation. It is absorbed upon oral administration and undergoes hepatic metabolism. The common side effects include drowsiness and potential hematological issues.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Mianserin acts on multiple receptors and transporters, suggesting a broad mechanism of action. Its known targets include various adrenergic receptors such as ADRA2A, ADRA2C, ADRA2B, ADRA1A, ADRA1B, and ADRA1D. It also interacts with multiple serotonin receptors: HTR1A, HTR1F, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and HTR7, plus dopamine receptors DRD1, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD5. It binds to both histamine receptors, HRH1 and HRH4, and to the kappa-type opioid receptor OPRK1. In terms of neurotransmitter transport modulation, it targets the sodium-dependent noradrenaline transporter SLC6A2, the sodium-dependent serotonin transporter SLC6A4, and the sodium-dependent dopamine transporter SLC6A3. Mianserin is metabolized by several cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic associations of mianserin predominantly involve its metabolism enzymes, notably CYP2D6. The activity of CYP2D6 varies significantly among individuals and can affect the drug's plasma concentration and therapeutic outcomes. Differential activity is attributed to genetic polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 gene, leading to classifications into poor, intermediate, extensive, or ultrarapid metabolizers. Patients who are poor metabolizers may have increased exposure to mianserin, potentially increasing the risk of adverse effects or toxicity, while ultrarapid metabolizers may require higher doses to achieve therapeutic effects. Despite this inference, specific pharmacogenetic testing guidelines for mianserin have not been firmly established, and clinical considerations are generally made based on observed drug efficacy and tolerance in individual patients.
