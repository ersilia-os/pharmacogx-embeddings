## Drug Summary
Isoprenaline, also known as Proternol L and Saventrine, is a non-selective beta adrenergic receptor agonist, primarily used in the management of heart block, Adams-Stokes attacks, bronchospasm during anesthesia, and various forms of shock including cardiogenic and hypovolemic shock. It was first approved by the FDA in 1948. The drug mimics the action of epinephrine but does not cause vasoconstriction, providing a broader therapeutic index and reducing the risks linked to adrenaline. Isoprenaline is recognized for increasing cardiac output and heart rate, as well as dilating bronchi. The pharmacokinetics of Isoprenaline show that it is rapidly metabolized mainly into glucuronide conjugates and methylated derivatives, with a short duration of action due to rapid clearance from the system.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Isoprenaline primarily acts on beta-1 (ADRB1), beta-2 (ADRB2), and to a lesser extent, beta-3 (ADRB3) adrenergic receptors. Activation of these receptors enhances cardiac contractility, neural conduction in the heart, and promotes relaxation and rate of heartbeat, along with effects on glycogenolysis and glucagon release. The drug also affects pulmonary pathways by regulating sodium and chloride ion transport, assisting in alveolar fluid clearance. Metabolically, Isoprenaline is processed by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), and cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, along with cholinesterase (BCHE), forming various metabolites. Additionally, Serum albumin (ALB) acts as a carrier for the drug, although specific effects of this interaction are less detailed.

## Pharmacogenetics
Given its significant interaction with beta-adrenergic receptors and metabolic enzymes, genetic variants in the ADRB1, ADRB2, or ADRB3 genes could potentially alter the pharmacodynamic response to Isoprenaline. Variations in these genes may impact receptor sensitivity or the maximal response achievable by receptor activation. Similarly, genetic polymorphisms in the metabolic enzymes, COMT, CYP1A1, and CYP1B1 could influence the rate at which Isoprenaline is metabolized, thereby affecting the drugâ€™s efficacy and safety profile. However, specific pharmacogenetic guidelines or established genetic associations for Isoprenaline are not extensively documented, which implies that more research could be beneficial to understand individual variations in response to this therapy.
