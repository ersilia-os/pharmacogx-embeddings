## Drug Summary
Hydralazine, also marketed under names such as Alphapress, Aprezin, and others, is primarily used as an antihypertensive agent. Initially developed in the 1950s for treating malaria, hydralazine was repurposed due to its vasodilatory effects on arteriolar smooth muscle, assisting in blood pressure management. It is often used alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of hypertension and, in combination with isosorbide dinitrate, for heart failure. Despite being overshadowed by newer antihypertensive drugs, hydralazine remains of significant clinical importance. The drug operates by interfering with calcium transport mechanisms in vascular smooth muscle, though the exact pathway remains partially understood. Hydralazine's pharmacokinetics include improved bioavailability with food intake, and its effect tends to manifest within 2-6 hours, with a patient-tolerable dose reaching up to 300mg.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Hydralazine’s mechanism to lower blood pressure involves primary targets such as Membrane primary amine oxidase (AOC3), Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1A), and Prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha-1 (P4HA1). It acts by modulating calcium transport, preventing calcium influx and direct interactions with intracellular components like actin and myosin. The metabolic pathways of hydralazine include hydroxylation followed by glucuronidation, with cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) being a key enzyme involved. Additionally, serum albumin (ALB) acts as a carrier, affecting the drug's distribution within the body. There are no specific transporters noted for hydralazine in the provided data.

## Pharmacogenetics
Hydralazine’s metabolism exhibits dependence on acetylator status marked by variations in genetic expression affecting enzyme activity, specifically impacting its clearance rates and therapeutic effectiveness. The drug demonstrates different pharmacokinetic profiles in patients categorized as slow or fast acetylators, a phenomenon influenced by polymorphisms in the N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) gene. Although not detailed in the provided DrugBank entry, literature indicates that genetic variation in NAT2 can affect the dose requirements and risk of side effects such as drug-induced lupus erythematosus. Personalized dosing may be beneficial, accommodating individual genetic backgrounds to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects, though specific guidelines on genetic testing prior to treatment initiation are yet to be defined comprehensively.
