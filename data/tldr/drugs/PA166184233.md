## Drug Summary
Vernakalant, marketed under brand names such as Kynapid in Canada and Brinavess in Europe, is an antiarrhythmic medication primarily used for the rapid conversion of recent onset atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm in adults. It classifies as an atypical class III antiarrhythmic agent with a unique action mechanism favoring higher heart rates. Developed by Cardiome Pharma, it was first approved in Europe in 2010, and later in Canada in 2017, but remains under FDA review in the U.S. The drug’s effect involves blocking multiple atrial-specific ion channels, prolonging atrial refractoriness and minimally affecting ventricular durations. Pharmacokinetically, it reaches peak plasma concentrations rapidly post-intravenous infusion and exhibits dual elimination pathways based on genetic variations in metabolizer status.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Vernakalant acts on several specific ion channels. It targets the SCN5A gene encoding the sodium channel protein type 5 subunit alpha, blocking atrial voltage-gated sodium channels, which affects intra-atrial conduction. It also inhibits the Kav1.5 channel encoded by KCNA5 and the Kv4.3 channel by KCND3, both potassium voltage-gated channels affecting atrial refractoriness. Secondary targeting includes inhibition of hERG channels encoded by KCNH2, implicated in mild QT prolongation without significant proarrhythmic risk. Metabolism is predominantly managed by the CYP2D6 enzyme, which facilitates O-demethylation in extensive metabolizers, while glucuronidation prevails in poor metabolizers. No specific transporters or carriers are noted for Vernakalant.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of Vernakalant is significantly shaped by variability in the CYP2D6 enzyme activity, which is responsible for its metabolism. Patients characterized as CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers predominantly process Vernakalant through O-demethylation, likely leading to faster drug clearance and possibly differing efficacy or risk profiles compared to poor metabolizers who metabolize the drug primarily through glucuronidation. Such genetic variations can influence both the drug’s therapeutic effects and side effect profiles, suggesting a potential need for personalized dosing regimes. This highlights the importance of genotyping in areas of metabolism involving polymorphic enzymes like CYP2D6 in the clinical use of Vernakalant, although direct pharmacogenomic data from clinical trials or broader patient studies might still be limited.
