## Drug Summary
Cyclophosphamide, known by brand names such as Endoxan, Neosar, Procytox, Revimmune, and Sendoxan, is a prodrug that must be activated in the liver to become an effective alkylating nitrogen mustard antineoplastic and immunosuppressive agent. It is commonly used in the treatment of various cancers including lymphomas, leukemia, multiple myeloma, and solid tumors like breast and ovarian cancer, as well as in certain non-malignant conditions such as nephrotic syndrome. The pharmacodynamics of Cyclophosphamide relies on its ability to alkylate DNA, forming cross-links which inhibit DNA replication and transcription, ultimately leading to cell death. Its absorption reaches peak concentrations about one hour after oral administration. The drug undergoes extensive metabolism primarily in the liver, facilitated by several cytochrome P450 isoforms.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Cyclophosphamide mainly targets DNA by forming cross-links that prevent DNA separation and replication. The key enzymes involved in its activation and metabolism include several cytochromes P450: CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C9, CYP2C18, and CYP2C19, with CYP2B6 being particularly significant due to its high 4-hydroxylase activity. These enzymes help convert Cyclophosphamide into its active metabolites, phosphoramide mustard and acrolein, contributing to both its therapeutic effects and toxicity. Thus far, no specific transporters or carriers have been implicated in its mechanism of action or disposition.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic variations significantly influence the metabolism and efficacy of Cyclophosphamide. Notably, polymorphisms in CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 can impact the drugâ€™s activation and subsequent therapeutic outcomes. Genotypes like CYP2B6 rs4802101 and CYP3A4 rs2740574 have been associated with reduced metabolism of Cyclophosphamide to its active form. Specifically, patients carrying the rs2740574 allele in CYP3A4 display reduced disease-free survival time when treated with Cyclophosphamide for node-positive breast cancer, emphasizing the clinical relevance of genetic testing prior to treatment to tailor and optimize therapeutic strategies.
