## Drug Summary
Methylphenidate is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant predominantly used to manage Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. Commonly known by names such as Ritalin, Concerta, and Biphentin among others, it is a pivotal part of treatment strategies that may also include psychological support and behavioral therapies. Methylphenidate exhibits its pharmacological activity principally through the inhibition of dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake, enhancing their concentration in synaptic spaces, which is specifically useful in managing ADHD symptoms like distractibility, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. The drug is administered in various formulations including immediate-release and modified-release systems to provide effective plasma concentration over time suitable for managing the patientâ€™s symptoms throughout the day. It has been deemed a safe and effective long-term treatment option by the Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Methylphenidate acts notably by binding to and inhibiting the action of the sodium-dependent dopamine transporter (SLC6A3) and the sodium-dependent noradrenaline transporter (SLC6A2). These transporters regulate the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine from the synaptic cleft, thus modulating the neurotransmission associated with arousal, attention, and executive functions. Additionally, methylphenidate shows affinity for the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A (HTR1A) which may influence serotonergic pathways, thereby contributing to its effects on mood and cognitive processes. It is largely metabolized by the hepatic carboxylesterase CES1A1 into ritalinic acid, which largely lacks pharmacological activity.

## Pharmacogenetics
Specific genetic variables play a significant role in the pharmacodynamics and drug responsiveness of methylphenidate. Research have highlighted abnormalities in genes like DAT1 (dopamine transporter gene), DRD4 (dopamine D4 receptor gene), and possibly DRD2, which might influence individual responses to the drug. Variation in these genes could potentially mediate the degree of receptor expression and functionality, impacting the clinical effectiveness of methylphenidate in improving ADHD symptoms. Moreover, the enzyme CES1A1, responsible for methylphenidate's metabolism, could potentially be affected by genetic polymorphisms that alter its activity, though specific clinical implications of such variations are yet to be fully established. Studies suggest that individual genetic make-up can considerably affect drug efficacy and safety, underscoring the importance of personalized medicine approaches in the management of ADHD.
