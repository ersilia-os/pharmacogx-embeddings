## Drug Summary
Trandolapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used primarily to manage hypertension and to improve outcomes in conditions like myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure. It is a prodrug that requires metabolic activation in the liver to form trandolaprilat, which is significantly more potent in inhibiting ACE. The medication's action mechanism involves blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor that also stimulates aldosterone and vasopressin secretion. This leads to vasodilation, reduced blood pressure, and decreased overall peripheral vascular resistance. Trandolapril has low bioavailability (4-14%) due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Therapeutically, it can slow the progression of renal disease in diabetic patients with hypertension.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Trandolapril targets the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which plays a crucial role in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), affecting hemodynamic regulation and electrolyte balance. The active form of trandolapril, trandolaprilat, binds to ACE and inhibits it. The drug is metabolized primarily by liver carboxylesterase 1 (CES1), which is responsible for the cleavage of its ester group forming the active metabolite trandolaprilat. Additionally, trandolapril and its metabolites interact with solute carriers such as SLC15A1 and SLC15A2, which may play a role in its absorption and disposition.

## Pharmacogenetics
The efficacy and metabolism of trandolapril can be influenced by genetic variations, particularly in the gene encoding for its metabolizing enzyme, CES1. Variants in the CES1 gene can affect the enzymatic activity, thus altering the levels of the active metabolite trandolaprilat and impacting the drug's effectiveness and safety profile. Moreover, genetic differences in the ACE gene itself might also modify the drug's efficacy, as they can influence the expression levels or activity of the enzyme targeted by trandolapril. However, specific pharmacogenetic guidelines for trandolapril are not well established, making it a potential area for further research to optimize dosing and minimize adverse effects.
