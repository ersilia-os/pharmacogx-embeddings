## Drug Summary
Mirtazapine, sold under various brand names such as Avanza, Remeron, and Zispin, is a tetracyclic antidepressant primarily approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). First approved in the Netherlands in 1994 and subsequently by the FDA in 1997, mirtazapine is unique for its rapid onset of antidepressant action, often observable within the first week of treatment. The drug is also used off-label for conditions such as panic disorder, PTSD, and various sleep disorders. Mirtazapine achieves its effects through a dual mechanism of increasing noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission in the brain, primarily by antagonizing central presynaptic α2-adrenergic receptors which increases neurotransmitter release. It is also a potent antagonist of several serotonin receptors, contributing to its varied therapeutic effects, such as improving sleep and appetite. Mirtazapine is rapidly absorbed with peak concentrations reached about 2 hours post-ingestion, and it is extensively metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Mirtazapine acts on multiple targets including several receptors and enzymes. It is an antagonist of central α2-adrenergic receptors like ADRA2A, and serotonin receptors such as HTR2A and HTR2C, which enhances noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission. Additionally, it targets alpha-1 adrenergic receptors (ADRA1A, ADRA1B, ADRA1D), histamine H1 receptor (HRH1), and the kappa-opioid receptor (OPRK1). The antagonism of HRH1 is primarily responsible for its sedative effects. Mirtazapine’s interaction with opioid receptors partly explains its analgesic effects. The drug undergoes extensive metabolism involving cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2. There is also interaction with the sodium-dependent serotonin transporter (SLC6A4), which plays a role in its modulation of serotonergic activities. There are no significant interactions with any carriers reported.

## Pharmacogenetics
The impact of genetics on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mirtazapine is notable, albeit complex. Key genes that influence mirtazapine’s metabolism include CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4. Polymorphisms in these genes can lead to variable enzyme activity, which in turn can affect drug plasma levels, efficacy, and risk of side effects. For instance, individuals with reduced function alleles of CYP2D6 may experience higher plasma concentrations of mirtazapine, leading to increased adverse effects or toxicity. Polymorphic variation in the target receptors like HTR2A and ADRA2A might also influence individual responses to mirtazapine, including therapeutic efficacy and side effect profiles. However, specific pharmacogenetic guidelines for mirtazapine dosing based on genetic differences are not well established and could be an area for future clinical research and application.
