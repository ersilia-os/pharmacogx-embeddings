## Drug Summary
Atovaquone, also known by brand names such as Acuvel and Wellvone, is a hydroxynaphthoquinone derivative with antimicrobial and antipneumocystis properties. It is primarily used to treat or prevent Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, especially in patients intolerant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Atovaquone is also used in antimalarial protocols. The drug is highly lipophilic and structurally similar to ubiquinone. It operates mainly by inhibiting mitochondrial electron transport, affecting ATP and pyrimidine biosynthesis critically in susceptible parasites. It is noted for its low and variable bioavailability, which is significantly affected by food intake. Metabolism of atovaquone appears minimal, with no definitive metabolites identified.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Atovaquone targets the cytochrome bc1 complex (Complex III) in Plasmodium species, which is crucial for mitochondrial electron transport. This mechanism is essential for its effectiveness against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. Another target includes the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) in humans and Plasmodium falciparum which is also linked to mitochondrial actions. The enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 are involved with this drug, hinting at potential metabolic pathways, though atovaquone itself shows minimal metabolism. Additionally, the transporter involved is ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), key in mediating the cellular efflux of the drug and affecting its pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
Atovaquone’s pharmacokinetics and response variability can be influenced by genetic variations in metabolic enzymes and transporters. Although specific pharmacogenetic data are not mentioned, the involvement of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 suggests potential genetic influences on drug metabolism considering the polymorphic nature of these enzymes. Variants in these genes could affect the metabolic rate and efficacy of atovaquone. Likewise, variations in the ABCB1 gene, encoding the P-glycoprotein transporter, could affect the drug's absorption and distribution. This is particularly relevant given atovaquone’s low oral bioavailability. Genetic variability in these proteins may necessitate dosage adjustments or lead to differences in drug efficacy and safety profiles among individuals.
