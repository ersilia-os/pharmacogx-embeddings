## Drug Summary
Trastuzumab deruxtecan is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) primarily employed in the treatment of various HER2-positive cancers, including breast and gastric cancers. It consists of a humanized anti-HER2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody (trastuzumab) linked to a topoisomerase I inhibitor (deruxtecan, DXd). This configuration allows for the targeted delivery of the cytotoxic agent to HER2-expressing tumor cells, effectively enhancing antitumor activity while minimizing systemic toxicity. The drug's pharmacodynamics involve binding to HER2 on the cancer cell surfaces, internalization of the conjugate, and subsequent release of DXd leading to DNA damage and cancer cell apoptosis. Trastuzumab deruxtecan shows a high maximum concentration and area under curve at therapeutic doses, indicative of significant in vivo stability and sustained drug exposure. Metabolism occurs mainly via catabolic processes, breaking the ADC into smaller peptides and amino acids, with some involvement of cytochrome P450 3A4 in the metabolism of released DXd.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Trastuzumab deruxtecan targets the HER2 receptor (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) and DNA topoisomerase 1 (TOP1), which are crucial for its mechanism of action. The lysosomal enzymes cathepsin B (CTSB) and L1 (CTSL) are involved in the cleavage of the peptide linker, a key step for the release and activation of deruxtecan. Furthermore, it is metabolized partly by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). The drug interacts with various transporters which can affect its disposition and toxicity, including P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), solute carrier family members (SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3), multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 2 (SLC47A2), and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (ABCC1, ABCG2).

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors can influence the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab deruxtecan, though detailed genomic data specific to this drug were not provided. Potential genetic variations in the expression or function of HER2 may affect the therapeutic response. Also, polymorphisms in CYP3A4 might alter the metabolism of the cytotoxic component, DXd, affecting both efficacy and adverse effect profiles. Similarly, genetic variations in transporter genes like ABCB1, SLCO1B1, and ABCG2 could impact drug distribution and excretion, leading to variability in drug levels and toxicity. Pharmacogenetic testing might be beneficial to tailor treatments and manage risks, ensuring maximum efficacy while minimizing adverse effects, although specific guidelines for such testing in relation to trastuzumab deruxtecan are currently undefined and warrant further research.
