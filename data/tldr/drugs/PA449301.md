## Drug Summary
Didanosine, also known by its abbreviation ddI, is a dideoxynucleoside belonging to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) class, primarily used in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults. Structurally, Didanosine lacks a 3'-hydroxy group, crucial for preventing the formation of phosphodiester linkages necessary for DNA chain elongation. It competitively inhibits the HIV reverse transcriptase and terminates DNA synthesis upon its incorporation. The drug exhibits rapid absorption with bioavailability around 30-40%, peaking within 0.5 to 1.5 hours post-administration. It is initially metabolized intracellularly to its active form, dideoxyadenosine triphosphate (ddATP), which actively inhibits viral replication, and further metabolism occurs hepatically yielding metabolites like hypoxanthine.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Didanosine primarily targets the HIV-1 enzyme, reverse transcriptase, by mimicking its natural substrate, dATP, thus integrating into the viral DNA and abruptly ending its elongation due to its modified structure. It also affects 'Purine nucleoside phosphorylase' (PNP) in humans, although its clinical significance in the context of Didanosine therapy isn't stated clearly. Pertaining to transport mechanisms, Didanosine is recognized and transported by several solute carriers: SLC22A6 (solute carrier family 22 member 6), SLC29A1 (equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1), and SLC29A2 (equilibrative nucleoside transporter 2), which facilitate its cellular uptake. Additionally, Didanosine can bind to serum albumin (ALB), which might influence its distribution and bioavailability.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, Didanosine's pharmacogenetics does not have abundant explicitly detailed descriptions, but its effectiveness and safety can vary based on genetic differences among individuals. Given that Didanosine is metabolized to active metabolites intracellularly, genetic variants associated with metabolic enzymes could influence its efficacy and toxicity profile. Specifically, genetic variations in enzymes like those involved in purine metabolism (potentially including PNP) might modulate the drugâ€™s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Moreover, transporters like SLC29A1 and SLC29A2 are known to be genetically variable, which could affect the cellular uptake and overall therapeutic outcomes of Didanosine. While more detailed genetic data would be beneficial, the response to Didanosine in HIV treatment could be impacted by individual genetic backgrounds, highlighting a need for further pharmacogenetic research in patients receiving this therapy.
