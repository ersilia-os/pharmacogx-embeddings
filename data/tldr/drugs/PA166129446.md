## Drug Summary
Simvastatin acid, an active metabolite of simvastatin, is primarily used in the management of dyslipidemias and the prevention of cardiovascular disease. It belongs to the class of statins, which are inhibitors of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. This inhibition leads to a reduction in the hepatic synthesis of cholesterol. Simvastatin is prodrug that is metabolized in the liver to its active form, simvastatin acid, which has a potent lipid-lowering action. The pharmacokinetics of simvastatin involve absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, transformation in the liver via CYP3A4-mediated oxidation, and subsequent systemic circulation of simvastatin acid.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Simvastatin acid specifically targets and inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme critical for the upstream step in cholesterol biosynthesis. This interference with the mevalonate pathway results in decreased cholesterol synthesis and increased uptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from the bloodstream, due to upregulated LDL receptor expression on hepatocyte surfaces. As a metabolite of simvastatin, this acid form follows the metabolic pathway, primarily involving the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme for its conversion from the prodrug. It is also recognized that specific transport proteins, likely including members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, play a role in its hepatic uptake and biliary excretion.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of simvastatin, and by extension, simvastatin acid, is significantly influenced by genetic variations in the CYP3A4 gene, which govern the rate of metabolism of the drug. Variants in the SLCO1B1 gene, encoding the organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 that affects drug uptake into hepatocytes, have been strongly associated with differences in drug efficacy and risk of adverse effects, such as myopathy. Patients with certain SLCO1B1 polymorphisms may exhibit increased plasma concentrations of simvastatin acid, heightening the risk for statin-induced myopathy. This is an important consideration for personalized medicine, often warranting genetic screening prior to therapy initiation to assess risk for adverse effects based on these pharmacogenetic markers.
