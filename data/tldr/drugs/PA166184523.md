## Drug Summary
Alpelisib, marketed under the name Piqray, is a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, specifically targeting the PI3Kα isoform p110α. It plays a crucial role in regulating biological processes such as cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, and metabolism. By inhibiting PI3Kα, alpelisib shows potent antitumor activity. This drug is particularly effective in hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, and PIK3CA-mutated advanced or metastatic breast cancer, administered alongside fulvestrant. It is also approved for treating severe manifestations of PIK3CA-Related Overgrowth Spectrum (PROS) under accelerated approval. Absorption peaks at approximately 2 hours post-administration, and its pharmacokinetics are notably influenced by meal intake, particularly high-fat meals significantly increase its absorption.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary target of alpelisib is the PIK3CA gene product, the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3Kα, which often harbors activating mutations in various cancers. This mutation-driven hyperactivation is pivotal in cancer cell proliferation and survival. In terms of metabolism, alpelisib is primarily processed by CYP3A4, with additional involvement from CYP2C9, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19 enzymes. This drug is also a substrate for the efflux transporters ABCG2 (Breast Cancer Resistance Protein) and ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein). The complex interaction with these enzymes and transporters can influence both the efficacy and safety profile of the drug, necessitating careful management and monitoring.

## Pharmacogenetics
Alpelisib’s efficacy hinges on the presence of PIK3CA mutations, making its use contingent upon genetic testing approved by the FDA. These mutations lead to an overactivation of the PI3K pathway, contributing to tumorigenic processes. Genetic variations within the metabolizing enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19 may further influence the drug's pharmacokinetics and patient response. For instance, polymorphisms in CYP3A4 affecting enzyme activity could potentially modify drug levels and side effects. Additionally, variations in the ABCG2 and ABCB1 transporter genes could affect drug efflux from cells, thereby impacting effectiveness and toxicity. These pharmacogenetic insights are critical for optimizing dosing regimens and minimizing adverse effects, improving the therapeutic outcomes of alpelisib in cancer treatment.
