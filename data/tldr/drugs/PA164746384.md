## Drug Summary
Nalidixic acid is a synthetic antibacterial agent belonging to the 1,8-naphthyridine class, primarily used for the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by susceptible gram-negative microorganisms. This includes pathogens like *E. coli*, *Enterobacter* spp., *Klebsiella* spp., and *Proteus* spp. Nalidixic acid operates as an inhibitor of the bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase, particularly targeting the A subunit, which is crucial for DNA replication and transcription. Its antibacterial action is bactericidal across a wide urinary pH range. Following oral administration, the drug exhibits high bioavailability (~96%) but its absorption can be influenced by concurrent antacid use. About 30% of nalidixic acid is metabolized in the liver to its active metabolite, hydroxynalidixic acid, which contributes significantly to its antimicrobial activity.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Nalidixic acid directly targets the DNA gyrase enzyme of bacteria, thus interfering with bacterial DNA and protein synthesis by binding strongly and reversibly to DNA. Though specific detailed targeting data was not provided in the summary, this mechanism underlies its effectiveness against certain bacteria while species like *Pseudomonas* remain resistant. Metabolism of nalidixic acid occurs in the liver primarily via the enzyme cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) and to a lesser extent, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2). It is actively transported in the kidney by solute carrier family 22 member 6 (SLC22A6) which may affect its excretion and efficacy.

## Pharmacogenetics
Nalidixic acid metabolism involves CYP1A2, suggesting that genetic variants in the CYP1A2 gene could influence the pharmacokinetics and potentially the safety profile of the drug. Individuals with variations leading to decreased CYP1A2 activity may have altered drug metabolism, potentially leading to increased exposure and risk of toxicity, while those with increased activity could have reduced efficacy. Genetic testing for CYP1A2 variants could be beneficial in optimizing nalidixic acid dosing although specific guidelines for adjusting dose based on genetic makeup have not been extensively formalized. No direct pharmacogenomic data is provided in the summary, but the involvement of enzymes like CYP1A2 known to be genetically polymorphic emphasizes the relevance of considering patient-specific genetic factors when prescribing nalidixic acid.
