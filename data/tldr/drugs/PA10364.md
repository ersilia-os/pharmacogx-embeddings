## Drug Summary
Memantine, sold under brand names such as Abixa, Akatinol, and Memox, is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist approved by the FDA in 2013 for the management of moderate to severe Alzheimer's dementia. Memantine functions uniquely compared to traditional cholinesterase inhibitors used in Alzheimer's disease by blocking the effects of glutamate, which is thought to contribute to the symptoms of Alzheimer's due to its excitatory properties on neurons. The drug has a well-established absorption profile, is partially metabolized in the liver via a pathway that does not significantly involve the CYP450 system, and exhibits linear pharmacokinetics, allowing it to be administered without regard to food.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Memantine primarily targets multiple subunits of the NMDA receptor (GRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN2C, GRIN2D, GRIN3A, GRIN3B), which are crucial in modulating neurological functions and memory. Besides NMDA receptors, it also minimally affects other receptors and ion channels including the 5HT3 receptors (HTR3A), various GABA(A) receptor subunits, and neuronal acetylcholine and glycine receptors. Regarding metabolism, memantine is processed in the liver by enzymes such as CYP2A6, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6 to a lesser extent, and its transport involves solute carriers like SLC22A2 and SLC22A4, which are important for renal excretion.

## Pharmacogenetics
For memantine, pharmacogenetic considerations mainly involve genomic variations that can influence drug processing and response. Enzymes such as CYP2B6 and CYP2C19, involved in its metabolism, are known to have genetic polymorphisms affecting their activity. Variants in these genes might alter the drug's metabolic rate, potentially requiring dosage adjustments to maintain therapeutic efficacy and avoid toxicity. However, detailed pharmacogenetic guidelines specific to memantine use are not well-established, indicating a need for further research to optimize memantine therapy based on individual genetic makeup. Moreover, genetic variations in NMDA receptor subunits might influence the drug's efficacy, considering their primary role as drug targets. Hence, genetic assessments in these areas could be pivotal in tailoring individual treatments, although these are currently more theoretical considerations than widely practiced protocols.
