## Drug Summary
Carboplatin, also known by its trade name Paraplatin-AQ, is an organoplatinum compound classified as an alkylating agent. It was specifically developed as an analog of cisplatin, with an aim to reduce associated nephrotoxicity and vomiting. Approved by the FDA in 1989, carboplatin is mainly used for the treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma. It is often deployed in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for both initial treatment and palliative care of recurrent disease. Carboplatin acts by binding to DNA and interfering with its repair mechanism, leading to cell death, and it is administered intravenously with a dosing frequency typically every 4 weeks. The broad pharmacokinetics of carboplatin reveal dose-proportional increases in both maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and area under the curve (AUC). However, due to its narrow therapeutic index, careful monitoring for toxicity especially bone marrow suppression is required.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Although specific drug targets for Carboplatin are not provided, its anti-cancer activity stems from its ability to form DNA adducts that disrupt the DNA synthesis and transcription. Carboplatin is predominantly eliminated in its unchanged form, suggesting minimal metabolic transformation. Enzymes involved include Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1, GSTM1, GSTT1), which play roles in cellular protection against damage from oxidative stress, potentially influencing drug toxicity. NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NQO1) and Superoxide dismutase (SOD1) might be indirectly involved in modulating cellular redox status after exposure to the drug. Carboplatin uptake and efflux from cells are facilitated by transporters such as ATP7A, ATP7B (copper-transporting ATPases), and ABCG2 (a key efflux transporter), which might affect the drugâ€™s intracellular concentrations and thereby its efficacy and toxicity.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetics plays a crucial role in the variability of responses to carboplatin. Polymorphisms in genes encoding for the metabolizing enzymes and transporters such as GSTP1, GSTM1, SLC31A1, and ABCG2 can result in differences in drug concentrations at the target site, influencing both efficacy and adverse effects. For example, polymorphisms in GSTP1 may affect Carboplatin detoxification, leading to variations in patient tolerance to the drug. Similarly, variants of ABCG2 may alter drug efflux, impacting resistance profiles or toxicity. These genetic variations underscore the importance of considering individual genetic makeup in dosing and predicting responses to carboplatin, particularly in the management of ovarian carcinoma, improving therapeutic outcomes and minimizing adverse effects.
