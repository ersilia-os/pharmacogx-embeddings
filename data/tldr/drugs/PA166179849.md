## Drug Summary
Avatrombopag, marketed under the name Doptelet, is an orally administered small molecule thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist. It is used to treat thrombocytopenia in adults with chronic liver disease who are scheduled for a medical procedure, and in those with chronic immune thrombocytopenia who have had an inadequate response to previous treatments. The drug acts by stimulating the proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytes from bone marrow progenitors, which increases platelet production. Avatrombopag has the advantage of not increasing platelet activation, thus avoiding the risk of thrombosis associated with other platelet-increasing therapies. It exhibits dose-proportional pharmacokinetics with peak plasma concentrations occurring 5-8 hours post-administration and a half-life of 16-18 hours.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Avatrombopag targets the thrombopoietin receptor (MPL), primarily functioning as an agonist, leading to increased platelet production without the competitive inhibition seen with natural thrombopoietin. The drug is metabolized predominantly by cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, with additional contributions from CYP2C8. This indicates that its clearance from the body involves hepatic processing. In terms of transport, Avatrombopag interacts with several transporters, including P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2), and solute carrier family 22 member 8 (SLC22A8). This interaction with multiple transport proteins suggests a complex distribution mechanism possibly affecting its bioavailability and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
Avatrombopagâ€™s metabolism by hepatic enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 suggests potential pharmacogenetic influences on its pharmacokinetics. Variations in these genes could impact the metabolic rate and efficacy of the drug, possibly requiring dose adjustments in patients with certain genetic profiles. For example, individuals with variant alleles of CYP2C9 or CYP3A4, which alter enzyme activity, might experience different drug levels leading to alterations in efficacy or risk of adverse effects. Although specific pharmacogenetic guidelines for Avatrombopag are not explicitly documented, the involvement of these enzymes indicates that genetic variability could be a significant factor in its clinical use, warranting further investigation and personalized approach in dosing strategies.
