## Drug Summary
Asciminib, marketed under the brand name Scemblix, is an allosteric tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) specifically designed for treating Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML) in adult patients. This drug is particularly indicated for patients resistant to more than two TKIs and those with the T315I mutation, known for its resistance to traditional TKI treatment. Asciminib operates uniquely by binding to the myristoyl pocket of the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein. This fusion protein, produced by the BCR and ABL1 gene translocation, is pivotal in CML proliferation. The drug locks this protein into an inactive conformation, thereby inhibiting its tyrosine kinase activity and slowing disease progression. With its oral administration, asciminib has a median absorption time (T_max) of 2.5 hours and exhibits different pharmacokinetic properties based on dosing regimes, showing its effectiveness at both lower and high doses dependent on disease mutation status.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Asciminib's primary target is the ABL1 tyrosine-protein kinase, a component of the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, which is critical in the pathology of CML. The drug’s metabolism involves minor participation by several enzymes. Its oxidative metabolism is mediated primarily by CYP3A4, with additional glucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and UGT2B17, as well as interactions with CYP2C19 and CYP2C9. Several transporters such as ABCG2, ABCB1, SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, and SLC22A1 are involved in drug disposition, affecting both distribution and excretion, indicating potential interactions affecting drug levels via these pathways.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic considerations for asciminib prominently involve genes related to its metabolism and transport, potentially influencing both therapeutic efficacy and toxicity profiles. CYP3A4, a major enzyme in drug metabolism, may exhibit variability based on genetic polymorphisms that could affect the drug’s metabolism and required dosing regiment. Transporters like ABCG2 and ABCB1, known to be influenced by genetic variations, could also alter drug bioavailability and response. Polymorphisms in these transporter genes may lead to differences in drug efflux from cells, potentially requiring adjustments in dosing. Additionally, given the UGT2B7 and UGT2B17 involvement in glucuronidation, genetic variations in these UGT enzymes could influence drug toxicity and clearance rates, necessitating close monitoring and potential dose modifications to prevent adverse effects.
