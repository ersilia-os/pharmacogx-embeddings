## Drug Summary
Mercaptopurine, also known as Leukerin, is an antimetabolite antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressant properties, classified primarily for the treatment of acute lymphatic leukemia. This drug belongs to a family of purine analogues which impair nucleic acid biosynthesis by disrupting purine metabolism, critical for DNA and RNA synthesis. It is predominantly used in combination with other drugs for inducing remission and in maintenance programs for leukemia. Mercaptopurine's effect is achieved by interfering with purine nucleotide synthesis and metabolism. Clinically, the drug has shown variable and incomplete oral absorption (around 50%), and its metabolism occurs in the liver primarily via xanthine oxidase. The metabolic pathway involves several complex transformations including direct oxidation and methylation processes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Mercaptopurine targets several enzymes involved in purine metabolism. Its primary target is hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT1), which is essential for converting the drug into its active form inside cells. Additionally, it inhibits enzymes like amidophosphoribosyltransferase (PPAT) and inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH1 and IMPDH2), crucial for further purine synthesis. The drug's metabolism involves enzymes such as aldehyde oxidase (AOX1), thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), and xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase (XDH). In terms of transport, mercaptopurine interacts with several important solute carriers such as SLC22A8, ABCC4, ABCC5, SLC28A2, SLC28A3, SLC29A1, and SLC29A2, aiding in its cellular uptake and distribution across tissues.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors play a significant role in the efficacy and safety of mercaptopurine treatment. Particularly, genetic variations in the thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) gene have been associated with significant differences in drug metabolism and toxicity. Variants such as rs1800462, rs1800460, and rs1142345 in the TPMT gene lead to reduced enzyme activity, consequently slowing the drug's metabolism and increasing the risk of adverse effects like myelosuppression. Patients with these TPMT variants require lower doses of mercaptopurine to avoid toxicities. These pharmacogenetic insights are critical for tailoring leukemia treatment to individual genetic profiles, optimizing therapeutic outcomes and minimizing risks.
