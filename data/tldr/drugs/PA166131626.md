## Drug Summary
Osimertinib is an oral, third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), developed specifically to target mutant forms of EGFR associated with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Indicated for patients with NSCLC harboring specific EGFR mutations (T790M, exon 19 deletions, or exon 21 L858R mutations) detected by an FDA-approved test, osimertinib is used when disease progresses after first-line EGFR TKI therapy or as first-line treatment. Its development was in response to resistance to earlier-generation EGFR-TKIs and aims at minimizing toxicity by sparing wild-type EGFR. Osimertinib achieves plasma concentration peak around six hours post-administration and undergoes metabolism primarily via CYP3A4-mediated oxidation and dealkylation, yielding active metabolites AZ7550 and AZ5104.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Osimertinib acts by inhibiting the activity of the mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is central to the pathophysiology of many cases of NSCLC, particularly those that develop resistance through T790M, L858R mutations, or exon 19 deletions. This selective inhibition helps prevent the signaling pathways that promote cancer cell survival and proliferation. The drug is metabolized mainly by the cytochromes P450 enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2. Regarding transport processes, osimertinib and its metabolites are substrates for the transporters ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1) and ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2), which influence their distribution and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of osimertinib is significantly influenced by mutations in the EGFR gene, particularly the presence of T790M, L858R, and deletions in exon 19. These mutations not only confer sensitivity to osimertinib but also dictate its use in clinical settings, as its effectiveness is markedly enhanced in tumors harboring these specific genetic alterations. Metabolism by CYP3A4 also suggests potential interactions with inhibitors or inducers of this enzyme, which could affect osimertinib's pharmacokinetics and toxicity profile. Moreover, genetic variations in the ABCB1 and ABCG2 transport proteins could influence the drug's distribution and efflux from cells, potentially impacting efficacy and side effects. However, explicit pharmacogenomic data connecting these transporters with osimertinib pharmacokinetics and patient outcomes are not detailed but are inferred based on the roles these proteins typically play in drug transport.
