## Drug Summary
Ticagrelor, also known under the brand names Brilinta and Possia, is an oral antiplatelet medication primarily used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (heart attack), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome or a history of myocardial infarction. It is additionally indicated for patients at high risk of a first myocardial infarction or stroke due to coronary artery disease. Unlike prodrugs such as clopidogrel, ticagrelor does not require metabolic activation. It binds directly and reversibly to the P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor on platelets, inhibiting platelet aggregation and thereby reducing thrombotic events in arterial circulation. First described in 2003 and developed by Astra Zeneca, the drug was approved by the FDA in July 2011 and by the EMA in December 2010. It has a moderate duration of action necessitating twice-daily dosing.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Ticagrelor primarily functions by antagonizing the P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor (P2RY12), a key receptor in platelet aggregation and clot formation. The drug couples with various G proteins which inhibit adenylyl cyclase and activate other signaling pathways like PI3K, leading to reduced platelet aggregation. Its metabolism involves several cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, and to a lesser extent, CYP2C9 and CYP2B6. This defines its pharmacokinetic properties, including drug interactions, particularly with drugs that influence these enzymes. Additionally, ticagrelor and its active metabolites are substrates for the transporter protein P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1) and are highly bound to serum albumin (ALB), influencing their distribution and elimination profile.

## Pharmacogenetics
Ticagrelor's pharmacogenetic profile is influenced largely by variants in the genes encoding for its metabolizing enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, and the transporter protein ABCB1. Genetic variations in these enzymes can significantly affect the drug's plasma levels and its pharmacodynamic effects. For instance, polymorphisms in CYP3A5 may alter the metabolism and subsequent efficacy of ticagrelor, affecting individual response to therapy. Likewise, different alleles of ABCB1 can impact the absorption and excretion of ticagrelor, potentially modifying the risk of adverse effects such as bleeding. Although comprehensive genetic testing prior to ticagrelor therapy is not standard practice, understanding these genetic influences could guide personalized dosing and improve therapeutic outcomes by mitigating risks and enhancing efficacy.
