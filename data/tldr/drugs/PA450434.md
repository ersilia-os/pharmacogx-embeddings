## Drug Summary
Methoxyflurane, also known commercially as Penthrane, is an inhalational anesthetic primarily used for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. Historically, it has been utilized in surgical, obstetrical, and dental settings, though its use is relatively rare today due to safety concerns. Methoxyflurane functions by inducing muscle relaxation and reducing pain sensitivity through alterations in tissue excitability. This alteration occurs via the modulation of gap junction conductance, activation of calcium-dependent ATPase, and direct interaction with various receptors and ion channels. Methoxyflurane is metabolized hepatically, and its toxicity profile includes potential liver and kidney damage, CNS depression, and respiratory issues, particularly when overdosed.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Methoxyflurane interacts with a broad spectrum of molecular targets including multiple subunits of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor (GABRA1, GABRA2, GABRA3, GABRA4, GABRA5, GABRA6, GABRB1, GABRB2, GABRB3, GABRD, GABRE, GABRG1, GABRG2, GABRG3, GABRP, GABRQ), glutamate receptors (GRIA1), glycine receptors (GLRA1), and potassium channels (KCNA1). Additionally, it binds to ATP synthase (particularly the D subunit) and mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase (MT-ND1). Hepatic metabolism of methoxyflurane involves several cytochrome P450 isozymes including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP2E1. There is no specific information on transporters and carriers involved with this drug.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there is no detailed pharmacogenetic data provided for methoxyflurane. However, since methoxyflurane's metabolism involves various P450 enzymes, genetic variations in these enzymes, particularly CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, could potentially influence its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. For example, polymorphisms in CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are known to affect the metabolism of other substrates by altering enzyme activity levels, which could hypothetically affect methoxyflurane's clearance and toxicity profile. Additionally, variability in GABA receptor subtypes, influenced by genetic factors, could contribute to differences in sedative effects and sensitivity to methoxyflurane among individuals. Further research is warranted to establish clear pharmacogenetic guidelines for methoxyflurane.
