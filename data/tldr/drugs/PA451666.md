## Drug Summary
Thioridazine, known under various brand names such as Mellaril and Ridazine, belongs to the class of phenothiazine antipsychotics. It is primarily used to manage schizophrenia and generalized anxiety disorder. Thioridazine functions by modulating various neurotransmitters in the brain, but its use has been notably limited due to serious side effects, particularly cardiac arrhythmias, which led to its worldwide withdrawal in 2005. It exhibits mediocre antiemetic properties and differs from other antipsychotics like chlorpromazine by causing fewer extrapyramidal symptoms but more antimuscarinic effects. The drug is primarily metabolized in the liver with an absorption rate of approximately 60%.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Thioridazine acts primarily on the central nervous system by blocking postsynaptic dopaminergic D1 (DRD1) and D2 (DRD2) receptors, which are pivotal in the management of psychotic disorders. Besides affecting dopamine receptors, it also targets alpha-1-adrenergic receptors (ADRA1A and ADRA1B), the serotonin receptor (HTR2A), and the potassium channel (KCNH2). These interactions contribute to its wide range of physiological effects including alterations in vasomotor tone and basal metabolism. Metabolism of thioridazine involves several cytochrome P450 enzymes, notably CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1, crucial for its hepatic processing.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of thioridazine are particularly significant concerning its metabolism through CYP2D6, a highly polymorphic enzyme. Variants in the CYP2D6 gene can lead to different metabolic profiles, ranging from poor to ultra-rapid metabolism, which affects both the efficacy and toxicity of the drug. Poor metabolizers may experience enhanced adverse effects due to higher systemic concentrations of the drug, while ultra-rapid metabolizers may have reduced therapeutic effects. Although specific pharmacogenetic testing guidelines for thioridazine are not standard, considering CYP2D6 genotype may be crucial in personalizing therapy to minimize risks and optimize therapeutic outcomes. Additional investigation into the effects of other genetic variations, such as those impacting CYP2C19 and KCNH2 (linked to cardiac toxicity), could further elucidate individual risks and benefits in thioridazine therapy.
