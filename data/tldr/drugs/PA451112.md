## Drug Summary
Procarbazine, also known by its trade names Indicarb and Natulan, is classified as an antineoplastic alkylating agent. It is used primarily in combination with other drugs like mechlorethamine, vincristine, and prednisone in the MOPP protocol for treating stages III and IV Hodgkin's disease. Procarbazine interferes with DNA replication by cross-linking guanine bases in DNA strands and adding alkyl groups to various molecular components, disrupting necessary cellular functions such as protein, RNA, and DNA synthesis. This disruption prevents cells from dividing, specifically targeting the S phase of cell division. The drug is rapidly and completely absorbed, with primary metabolism occurring in the liver and kidneys, leading to several metabolic products including CO2 and CH4.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Procarbazine targets monoamine oxidases MAOA and MAOB, enzymes which are pivotal in the breakdown of monoamines and are involved in neurotransmitter regulation. This action contributes to its psychotropic side effects and might be part of its antineoplastic effects although the precise mechanisms in cancer therapy are not fully understood. It is primarily metabolized by liver enzymes, notably xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase (XDH), which facilitates its conversion into various metabolites. Information on specific transporters or carriers involved in procarbazine’s action or pharmacokinetics is not mentioned, indicating a lack of current data in these areas.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of Procarbazine in relation to its metabolism and effectiveness largely centers on its interaction with enzymes such as MAOA and MAOB, and the metabolic enzyme XDH. Variations in the genes encoding these enzymes could influence the drug’s effectiveness and side effect profile. For instance, polymorphisms in MAOA and MAOB could modify the neurologic and psychiatric side effects patients experience during treatment, given the role of these enzymes in neurotransmitter metabolism. The role of XDH in drug metabolism suggests that genetic variants altering XDH activity could impact drug levels and toxicity, though specific pharmacogenetic data linking these with clinical outcomes in procarbazine therapy are limited. Further research may provide deeper insights into how genetic variations affect the efficacy and safety of procarbazine treatment.
