## Drug Summary
Chlorproguanil is a dichloro-derivative of chloroguanide that has been investigated in clinical trials for the treatment of malaria. Although the specific pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and metabolism of chlorproguanil are not provided, it is known that compounds in this class generally work by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase, thereby disrupting DNA synthesis in the malaria parasite. Due to its relation to chloroguanide, chlorproguanil might display similar pharmacokinetic properties, which typically involve absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, metabolism in the liver, and excretion via the kidneys.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Given that the provided DrugBank information does not list specific targets, enzymes, transporters, or carriers for chlorproguanil, one can infer its activity based on its chemical class. As a chloroguanide derivative, chlorproguanil likely targets the dihydrofolate reductase enzyme (DHFR), interfering with folic acid synthesis which is crucial for DNA replication and cell division in the malaria parasite. The absence of detailed data on enzymes involved in its metabolism suggests reliance on general liver enzymes for biotransformation, typically involving the cytochrome P450 system. However, this is speculative and not confirmed by the provided data.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is no specific genomic data or pharmacogenetic information provided for chlorproguanil in the summary. Typically, the efficacy and safety of antimalarial drugs can vary based on genetic variations in both the human host and the parasite itself. For instance, resistance in malaria parasites to similar antifolates can result from mutations in the DHFR gene of the parasite. In humans, genetic variability in metabolic enzymes (e.g., CYP450 isoforms) could hypothetically affect the metabolism of chlorproguanil, influencing drug levels and effects, although this is not specifically documented for chlorproguanil. Further research could potentially reveal important pharmacogenetic associations that impact the clinical use of chlorproguanil.
