## Drug Summary
Azithromycin, known by various brand names such as Zithromax and Sumamed, is a broad-spectrum macrolide antibiotic that is part of the azalide subclass. It is notable for its long half-life and high tissue penetration, making it particularly effective in the treatment of a variety of infections including respiratory, enteric, and genitourinary infections, as well as some sexually transmitted diseases. Azithromycin was approved by the FDA in 1991 and works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis, which is critical for bacterial growth. Its unique structure, differing from other macrolides by the inclusion of a nitrogen atom in the lactone ring, contributes to its reduced metabolism and hence, longer activity. Azithromycin's bioavailability is 37% following oral administration, and it is primarily metabolized in the liver.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Azithromycin binds to the 23S rRNA of the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit, inhibiting the transpeptidation and translocation steps of protein synthesis, effectively stopping bacterial growth. It shows strong affinity to bacterial ribosomes, a factor enhancing its broad-spectrum activity. The drug is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), and its intestinal absorption involves the P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) efflux transporter, encoded by the ABCB1 gene. Another transporter associated with azithromycin is the canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter 1 (ABCC2), which can be relevant in drug excretion processes.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of azithromycin involve its metabolism and transport. Metabolism by the enzyme CYP3A4 implies potential interactions with genetic variants of this enzyme, which could affect the drug’s clearance and efficacy. Individuals with certain polymorphisms in the CYP3A4 gene might experience altered metabolism speeds, leading to either increased side effects or decreased efficacy. Similarly, the ABCB1 gene, encoding the P-glycoprotein that influences azithromycin’s absorption, has several known polymorphisms that can affect the drug’s bioavailability and possibly the risk of toxicity. While specific, detailed pharmacogenetic data are not provided, these genes are crucial in the pharmacokinetics of azithromycin and patient responses can vary based on genetic makeup, impacting both effectiveness and safety profiles.
