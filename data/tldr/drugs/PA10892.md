## Drug Summary
Gliclazide, marketed under names such as Glimicron and Nordialex, is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used primarily for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), also known as Type 2 diabetes. It falls into the sulfonylurea class, providing its therapeutic effects by stimulating β cells in the pancreas to release insulin, thereby increasing basal and meal-stimulated insulin secretion. Pharmacodynamically, Gliclazide not only enhances insulin release but also improves insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. It is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, showing peak plasma concentrations within 4-6 hours, and is extensively metabolized by the liver. The metabolites are then mostly excreted through urine and, to a lesser extent, feces. Despite its efficacy, the drug carries a risk of causing hypoglycemia, particularly in conditions of inconsistent food intake, or in elderly or malnourished patients.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Gliclazide specifically targets and binds to the ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 8 (ABCC8) also known as the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) on the pancreatic β cells. Binding to this receptor blocks ATP-sensitive potassium channels, leading to cell depolarization and an intracellular cascade that results in insulin release. Additionally, the drug appears to have an interaction with vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), which might play a role in its effects on vascular dynamics, although this is less directly related to its primary mechanism of action in diabetes management. The metabolism of Gliclazide involves cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Its transport involves serum albumin (ALB), which may carry the drug or its metabolites in the bloodstream.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of Gliclazide is significantly influenced by polymorphisms in the CYP2C19 gene. Specific alleles, as evidenced by clinical studies summarized in the DrugBank database, such as rs4244285 and rs4986893, are known to be associated with reduced metabolism of Gliclazide, which can impact drug efficacy and the risk of adverse effects such as hypoglycemia. Patients with these polymorphic variants may require dose adjustments or alternative therapies to avoid suboptimal drug levels and associated risks. Consideration of a patient's CYP2C19 genotype may be beneficial in personalizing Gliclazide treatment regimes to maximize therapeutic outcomes and minimize risks.
