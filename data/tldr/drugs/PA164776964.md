## Drug Summary
Desloratadine, also known by the brand name Claramax, is a second-generation tricyclic antihistamine primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, as well as pruritus and urticaria related to chronic idiopathic urticaria. As an active descarboethoxy metabolite of loratadine, desloratadine exhibits a selective and peripheral H1-antagonist action, effectively blocking histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors without penetrating the central nervous system, thereby avoiding the sedative effects typically associated with first-generation antihistamines. The drug demonstrates good oral absorption, with peak serum levels occurring around three hours post-administration, and maintains a mean steady-state concentration conducive to once-daily dosing without influence from food intake. Metabolically, it is processed into an active metabolite, 3-hydroxydesloratadine, which is then glucuronidated.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Desloratadine specifically targets the Histamine H1 receptor (HRH1), competing with histamine for binding at this receptor located in various tissues such as gastrointestinal tract, uterus, blood vessels, and bronchial smooth muscle. This competition inhibits the typical histamine-mediated allergic responses like nasal congestion and watery eyes. Regarding its transport mechanisms, desloratadine is known to interact with P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), a transporter protein that may play a role in the drug's bioavailability and distribution. The information on specific enzymes and other carriers involved in the metabolism and transport of desloratadine is not detailed, but its primary metabolite is facilitated through glucuronidation.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there is limited direct pharmacogenetic data available for desloratadine. However, its interaction with the P-glycoprotein transporter (ABCB1) suggests potential pharmacogenetic implications, as genetic variants in the gene encoding this transporter (i.e., ABCB1) have been associated with variations in the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of other drugs. Subsequently, these variants could hypothetically influence the absorption and clearance of desloratadine, impacting its efficacy and safety profile across different individuals. As this inference is based on the role of the transporter rather than specific genetic studies on desloratadine itself, further research explicitly targeting these pharmacogenetic associations would be necessary to validate and understand any significant clinical implications.
