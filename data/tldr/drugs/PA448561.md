## Drug Summary
Benazepril, marketed under various brand names including Lotensin, Cibacen, and Briem, is primarily used to manage hypertension and is also effective in treating congestive heart failure and chronic renal failure. As a prodrug, benazepril requires metabolic activation in the liver, where its ester group is cleaved to form the active metabolite, benazeprilat. This active form is a potent non-sulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Pharmacodynamically, benazepril, through its metabolite benazeprilat, inhibits the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, resulting in decreased blood pressure, reduced aldosterone secretion, and overall vasodilation. After oral administration, the drug has a bioavailability of about 37%, with peak plasma concentrations reached within 0.5 to 1.5 hours. Its metabolism primarily involves hydrolysis followed by conjugation to glucuronic acid, with subsequent urinary excretion.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Benazeprilat, as the effective agent of benazepril, targets the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), inhibiting the formation of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor and stimulator of aldosterone secretion. The major enzyme involved in benazepril's metabolism is MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase), although its role seems subsidiary to esterase activity in the liver, primarily responsible for the cleavage of benazepril to benazeprilat. Benazepril and its metabolite are also known to interact with certain transporters such as SLC15A1 and SLC15A2 (solute carrier family 15 members), which could influence the drug’s absorption or reabsorption dynamics. No specific carriers are implicated in its mechanism of action or transport according to the provided data.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of benazepril centres primarily on its conversion to the active form, benazeprilat, and how variations in genes involved may affect this process or the drug's effectiveness. Variants in the ACE gene itself might influence the responsiveness to benazepril, given that ACE inhibitors directly alter the enzyme’s activity. Additionally, polymorphisms in transporter genes (SLC15A1 and SLC15A2) could modify the pharmacokinetics of the drug, potentially altering absorption and efficacy. Variability in the MTHFR gene may also impact the metabolism of benazepril, albeit in a less direct manner compared to liver esterases. Detailed genomic data or a broader range of known pharmacogenomic interactions was not provided, suggesting further research could be beneficial in optimizing individual responses to benazepril based on genetic factors.
