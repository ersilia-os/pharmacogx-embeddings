## Drug Summary
Fluorouracil, known by various trade names such as Carzonal, Efudix, Efurix, and Ftoruracil, is a chemotherapeutic agent classified as an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It acts as a pyrimidine analog interfering with DNA synthesis primarily by inhibiting the enzyme thymidylate synthase, essential for DNA replication. Its pharmacokinetic profile shows varied absorption (28%-100%) and it undergoes hepatic metabolism with the major catabolic products being CO2, urea, and α-fluoro-ß-alanine, which are inactive. Fluorouracil is utilized both topically and systemically. Topically, it treats actinic keratoses and superficial basal cell carcinomas, whereas systemically, it is used in the palliative management of various cancers including those of the colon, breast, stomach, and head and neck.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Fluorouracil targets Thymidylate Synthase (TYMS), inhibiting DNA production in cancer cells. It is metabolized by enzymes including Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase (DPYD), which is crucial for its catabolism, and affected by the activity of other enzymes such as Uridine Phosphorylase (UPP1, UPP2), Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP1A2, CYP2C9), and Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (MTHFR). Transporters like Solute Carrier Family 22 (SLC22A7), Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1 (SLC29A1), and various ATP-binding cassette sub-family members (ABCG2, ABCC3, ABCC4, ABCC5) also play roles in its cellular uptake and efflux. Albumin (ALB) and Thyroxine-binding globulin (SERPINA7) function as carriers, impacting its distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
Fluorouracil demonstrates significant pharmacogenetic variability mainly associated with the DPYD gene, which encodes the enzyme Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase. Variants such as rs3918290, rs55886062, rs67376798, rs1801158, rs1801159, rs1801160, and rs1801265 in DPYD are linked to reduced enzyme activity, hence affecting drug metabolism and increasing the risk of severe toxicity. Moreover, polymorphisms in TYMS and GSTP1 have been associated with altered response and increased toxicity risk following fluorouracil therapy. Genetic testing prior to initiation of fluorouracil therapy can identify individuals at risk of severe adverse effects, allowing for dose adjustment or alternative therapy considerations.
