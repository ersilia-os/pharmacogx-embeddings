## Drug Summary
Prednisone is a synthetic glucocorticoid used to treat a variety of conditions, including allergic, dermatologic, gastrointestinal, hematologic, ophthalmologic, nervous system, renal, respiratory, rheumatologic, infectious, endocrine, and neoplastic disorders. It also plays a role in immunosuppression for organ transplant patients. Initially inert, prednisone is metabolized in the liver to its active form, prednisolone. It exhibits a pharmacodynamic profile characterized by binding to glucocorticoid receptors, leading to reduced inflammation and modulation of immune responses. The drug has a relatively short half-life of 2-3 hours, and its absorption and action vary based on the formulation taken.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Prednisone primarily targets the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), whereby its metabolite prednisolone binds and activates the receptor to exert anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. Key enzymes involved in its metabolism include cytochromes P450 such as CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and others, which facilitate the conversion of prednisone to prednisolone and various other metabolites. Transporters like ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1) and SLCO1A2 are involved in the drug's pharmacokinetics by mediating its cellular uptake and distribution. The carriers such as ALB (albumin) and SERPINA6 (corticosteroid-binding globulin) play roles in the plasma binding and transport of prednisone and its metabolites, affecting the drug's bioavailability and distribution in the body.

## Pharmacogenetics
Variations in genes encoding the metabolizing enzymes (CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP3A5) and transporters (ABCB1) can significantly impact the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of prednisone. Genetic polymorphisms in these genes may alter enzyme activity or transporter function, leading to variations in drug metabolism, efficacy, and safety. Patients with certain alleles may experience either increased toxicity or decreased effectiveness of prednisone, necessitating adjustments in dosage. Additionally, genetic factors can influence the risk of side effects, particularly those related to long-term use of glucocorticoids, such as osteoporosis or adrenal suppression. Due to these potential variations, pharmacogenetic testing may be considered to optimize prednisone therapy tailored to individual genetic profiles.
