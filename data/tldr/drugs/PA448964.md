## Drug Summary
Chlorpromazine, also known as Aminazine, Largactil, and several other names, is a prototypical phenothiazine antipsychotic drug. This drug is primarily used for the treatment of schizophrenia and exhibits diverse pharmacological effects, including antiemetic, sedative, and anti-adrenergic properties. Chlorpromazine acts by blocking a variety of neurotransmitter receptors across the brain and peripheral organ systems, which leads to its wide range of therapeutic effects and side effects. Pharmacodynamically, it antagonizes dopaminergic, serotonergic, adrenergic, histaminergic, and muscarinic receptors. This drug is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but has variable bioavailability due to extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver. It is extensively metabolized mainly by cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4, producing several metabolites.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Chlorpromazine targets multiple neurotransmitter receptor systems. It binds to dopamine receptors (DRD1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, DRD5), affecting various symptoms of psychosis and motor functions. It also influences serotonergic receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C) involved in mood and anxiety regulation and exerts effects on alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors (ADRA1A, ADRA1B, ADRA1D, ADRA2A, ADRA2B, ADRA2C) impacting blood pressure and reflex tachycardia. The drug interacts with histamine receptors (HRH1, HRH4), contributing to its antiemetic and sedative properties, and muscarinic cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3), linked to side effects such as dry mouth and blurred vision. Enzymatically, it is metabolized predominantly by CYP2D6, with CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 also involved. Transporter proteins like ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) and carriers such as ALB (albumin) are also important for its pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
Chlorpromazine's metabolism is significantly influenced by genetic polymorphisms, particularly those affecting CYP2D6 enzyme activity. Variants in the CYP2D6 gene can lead to different metabolizer statuses (poor, intermediate, extensive, and ultra-rapid), affecting drug plasma levels and response. Poor metabolizers might experience enhanced adverse effects, whereas ultra-rapid metabolizers may require higher doses for efficacy. Additionally, variants in ABCB1 could influence the drugâ€™s distribution and elimination, although specific clinical implications or guidelines in this context are less clearly established. The pharmacogenetics of drug response and side effects, such as extrapyramidal symptoms or tardive dyskinesia, may also be mediated through genetic variations in dopamine and serotonin receptors, though direct associations have not been unequivocally defined and require further investigation.
