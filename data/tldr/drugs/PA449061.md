## Drug Summary
Clozapine, marketed under various names such as Leponex, Clozaril, and many others, is a tricyclic dibenzodiazepine and is distinguished as an atypical antipsychotic agent. It is uniquely effective in treating treatment-resistant schizophrenia and is further indicated for reducing recurrent suicidal behaviors in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Unlike typical antipsychotics predominantly targeting dopamine receptors, clozapine binds to a myriad of receptors but displays a relatively low affinity for dopamine receptors. This receptor profile accounts for its effectiveness in conditions unresponsive to other antipsychotics and its distinctive side effect profile including fewer extrapyramidal symptoms. Clozapineâ€™s pharmacokinetics involves substantial metabolism predominantly by the enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, with the bioavailable formulation reaching peak plasma concentrations at roughly 2.5 hours post-administration.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Clozapine acts on an extensive array of neuroreceptors: it is an antagonist of multiple dopamine receptors (DRD1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, DRD5), various serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR1B, HTR1D, HTR1E, HTR2A, HTR2C, HTR3A, HTR6, HTR7), adrenergic receptors (ADRA1A, ADRA1B, ADRA2A, ADRA2B, ADRA2C), and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1-5), among others. This broad receptor antagonistic action likely underpins both its therapeutic effects and side effects such as sedation and cardiovascular impacts. Clozapine is metabolized by several cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, impacting its clearance and necessitating consideration of potential drug interactions. It is also transported by P-glycoprotein and other solute carriers which could influence its distribution and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of clozapine is crucial due to its complex pharmacodynamics and risk of severe side effects, such as agranulocytosis and myocarditis. Genetic variants in metabolic enzymes like CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 can significantly affect clozapine levels, influencing both efficacy and adverse event risk. Specifically, variants in CYP2D6 can alter metabolic rate, potentially necessitating dose adjustments. Additionally, the presence of the rs5443 SNP in the GNB3 gene has been linked to increased weight gain among patients taking clozapine. Given the severity of potential side effects, genetic testing prior to treatment initiation might be beneficial to tailor therapy and monitor for adverse effects more effectively.
