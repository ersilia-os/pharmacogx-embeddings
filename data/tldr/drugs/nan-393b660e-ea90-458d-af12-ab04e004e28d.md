## Drug Summary
Cycloserine, also known by its synonyms Oxamycin and Tisomycin, is an antibiotic primarily used in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections. It is produced by Streptomyces garyphalus and acts as a broad-spectrum antibiotic which can be either bactericidal or bacteriostatic depending on the concentration and susceptibility of the infecting organism. Cycloserine inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by structurally mimicking the amino acid D-alanine, crucial for peptidoglycan formation. It is rapidly and substantially absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration, although specific details on its metabolism are not provided.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Cycloserine targets bacterial enzymes involved in cell wall synthesis, specifically L-alanine racemase (identified as 'alr'), which converts L-alanine to D-alanine, and D-alanine--D-alanine ligase A (identified as 'ddlA'), which incorporates D-alanine into the peptidoglycan precursor. These targets are essential for the formation of a strong bacterial cell wall. In humans, the aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase (identified as ‘DDC’) is listed as an enzyme involved, likely affecting amino acid metabolism linked to neurotransmitter synthesis. Additionally, Cycloserine is transported via the proton-coupled amino acid transporter 2 (SLC36A2), indicating a specific pathway for the drug's cellular uptake and possibly its pharmacokinetic behavior. No carriers are reported in the available data.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, the specific pharmacogenetic data for Cycloserine are not detailed in the provided information. However, given the involvement of human enzymes like DDC and transporters like SLC36A2 in its pharmacological activity, genetic variations in these proteins could potentially influence the drug's efficacy and safety profile. Variants in the SLC36A2 gene could alter the efficiency of drug uptake, potentially leading to variability in drug levels and response among patients. Similarly, polymorphisms in DDC, which is integral to neurotransmitter synthesis, could influence the neurological side effects associated with Cycloserine, although direct correlations would require further clinical and genetic studies to substantiate these pharmacogenetic associations.
