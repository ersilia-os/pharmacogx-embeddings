## Drug Summary
Enflurane, known by various names including Alyrane, Compound 347, Endurane, and Enfluran, is a halogenated inhalational anesthetic initially approved by the FDA in 1972 but later withdrawn from the US market. It is distinguished from similar agents like isoflurane and halothane due to its propensity to induce seizure activity and its heightened cardio depressant effects. Enflurane can be used for both the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia and has specific applications in obstetrics, such as inducing analgesia for vaginal delivery and as adjunctive therapy in Cesarean sections. Its pharmacodynamics involve rapid induction of anesthesia through modulation of neural channels, notably depressing excitatory channels and enhancing inhibitory channels which facilitates muscle relaxation and reduces blood pressure. The drug is metabolized primarily by the enzyme CYP2E1 in the liver, producing inorganic fluoride ions as a major metabolite.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Enflurane interacts with several neural receptors and channels to achieve its pharmacological effects. Key targets include the GABA(A) receptors (GABRA1, GABRA2, GABRA3, GABRA4, GABRA5, GABRB1, GABRB2, GABRB3, GABRD, GABRE, GABRG1, GABRG2, GABRG3, GABRP, GABRQ) and various subunits of the Voltage-dependent calcium channels (CACNA1A, CACNA1B, CACNA1C, etc.). These interactions contribute to its central nervous system depressant effects and impact on cardiac muscle contractility. The metabolism of enflurane primarily involves the enzyme CYP2E1, and it is partially carried in the bloodstream by serum albumin (ALB).

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of enflurane is significantly impacted by the CYP2E1 enzyme, which is responsible for its metabolism in the liver. Variants in the CYP2E1 gene can affect the metabolic rate of enflurane, potentially altering its efficacy and toxicity. For instance, certain allelic variations may lead to slower metabolism, increasing the risk of accumulation and associated toxicities including hepatotoxicity, which has been noted at elevated levels of enflurane. Additionally, enflurane's effect on triggering malignant hyperthermia in susceptible individuals is a critical pharmacogenetic concern but genetic predispositions impacting this risk are currently not well characterized and could involve multiple genetic pathways related to calcium channel regulation and muscle metabolism.
