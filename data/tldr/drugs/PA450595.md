## Drug Summary
Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) widely used for its analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Approved initially in 1976 for prescription and in 1994 for over-the-counter use, naproxen is indicated for managing conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and acute gout, as well as for pain relief in various scenarios including primary dysmenorrhea. It operates by the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzymes, thereby reducing prostaglandin synthesis which is crucial in mediating inflammation and pain. Available in several formulations, including immediate and delayed-release, naproxen's absorption can be influenced by the formulation with peak plasma concentrations achieved differently across forms. It is extensively metabolized in the liver predominantly through CYP enzymes and by conjugation with glucuronides.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Naproxen primarily targets COX-1 (Prostaglandin G/H synthase 1) and COX-2 (Prostaglandin G/H synthase 2) enzymes, helping reduce the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in the inflammatory process. Besides, naproxen is metabolized by several cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP2C8 and CYP2C9, as well as CYP1A2, and undergoes extensive conjugation through various UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) including UGT2B7 and UGT1A3 among others. It also interacts with several transporters such as SLCO1A2, SLC22A6, and ABCB1 that influence its distribution and excretion. Naproxen binds significantly to serum albumin (ALB), which can affect its free concentration in the plasma and hence its pharmacological activity.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenomic variations in CYP2C8 and CYP2C9, which are involved in the metabolism of naproxen, can lead to variability in drug exposure and response among individuals, affecting both efficacy and risk of toxicity. Variants in these genes may influence the rate of drug metabolism, potentially requiring dosage adjustments to achieve optimal therapeutic effects. Additionally, genetic differences in UGT enzymes, which catalyze glucuronidation, could also impact the disposition of the drug. Although more conclusive data may be needed to uniformly apply genetic information in clinical practice for naproxen dosing, recognizing these genetic influences can be crucial in personalizing treatment plans to minimize adverse effects while maximizing therapeutic efficacy. Genetic testing may be considered in cases of unusual drug response or adverse effects, guided by clinical judgment and available pharmacogenetic information.
