## Drug Summary
Efavirenz is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), widely used in combination with other antiretrovirals for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. It is branded under various names such as Sustiva, Stocrin, and others listed like E.F., Efavir, Efcure, Efferven, Estiva, Evirenz, Viranz. Efavirenz acts by targeting the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase enzyme, thereby inhibiting viral replication. It was originally approved for patients failing on zidovudine therapy but is now commonly part of first-line regimens combined with drugs like lamivudine and tenofovir. Pharmacodynamically, efavirenz interferes with the transcription of viral RNA into DNA, acting as a virus-static agent rather than eradicating the virus. The drug is metabolized mainly by the cytochrome P450 system, turning into hydroxylated metabolites that are less effective against HIV and subsequently conjugated via glucuronidation.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Efavirenz primarily targets the HIV-1 enzyme reverse transcriptase. Its metabolism involves numerous cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP2C8, while UGT1A1 is involved in its glucuronidation pathway. Efavirenz is also affected by transporters such as ABCB11 (bile salt export pump) and SLC22A1 (solute carrier family 22 member 1). The serum albumin (ALB) acts as a carrier for the drug. These interactions contribute significantly to the disposition and pharmacological profile of efavirenz.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors significantly impact the metabolism and efficacy of efavirenz. Variability in enzyme activity, particularly CYP2B6, due to genetic polymorphisms, can affect drug levels and outcomes. A well-studied example is the CYP2B6 rs3745274 polymorphism, which leads to reduced metabolism of efavirenz. Patients with this polymorphism typically have higher plasma levels of the drug, which can increase the risk of drug toxicity and necessitates dosage adjustments. Such pharmacogenetic insights are instrumental in personalizing efavirenz therapy, ensuring both effectiveness in suppressing HIV viral loads and minimizing side effects.
