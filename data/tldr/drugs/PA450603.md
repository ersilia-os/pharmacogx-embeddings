## Drug Summary
Nefazodone, known under the brand names Serzone and Dutonin, is a phenylpiperazine antidepressant used primarily for the treatment of major depressive disorder. The drug operates by modulating the serotonergic system, predominantly acting as a 5-HT<sub>2</sub> antagonist while also inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. Unlike tricyclic antidepressants, it has a lower propensity for cardiovascular toxicity, and compared to SSRIs, it does not significantly disrupt sleep architecture. Nefazodone is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration, but it has a low bioavailability of about 20%. It undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism. The drug was discontinued in several countries including the United States due to its link with severe hepatic injury, which could necessitate a liver transplant or lead to death.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Nefazodone interacts with multiple targets; its primary actions are antagonism at the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors 2A (HTR2A) and 2C (HTR2C), and inhibitory effects on the sodium-dependent serotonin transporter (SLC6A4). Additionally, it exhibits minor inhibition of norepinephrine (via SLC6A2) and dopamine (via SLC6A3) transporters, contributing to its antidepressant effects. Nefazodone also antagonizes both alpha-1A (ADRA1A) and alpha-1B (ADRA1B) adrenergic receptors. Regarding metabolic processing, CYP3A4 along with other members of the CYP3A subfamily (CYP3A43, CYP3A5, CYP3A7) mainly catalyze nefazodone's metabolism. The drug is also a substrate for transporters such as P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1) and various solute carrier organic anion transporters including SLCO1B3 and SLCO2B1.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors heavily influence the efficacy and safety of nefazodone. Variants in the genes encoding for cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, impact the metabolic rate of nefazodone and predispose individuals to either increased drug toxicity or reduced therapeutic effect. For example, individuals with poor metabolizing variants of CYP3A4 may experience higher concentrations of nefazodone, increasing the risk of hepatic injury. Similarly, polymorphisms in SLC6A4, which encodes the primary serotonin transporter, could affect the drug's antidepressant efficacy. However, detailed genomic data and specific SNP associations for nefazodone's pharmacogenomic profile remain less explored compared to more contemporary antidepressants, partly due to its withdrawal from major markets.
