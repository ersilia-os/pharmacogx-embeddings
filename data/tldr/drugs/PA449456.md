## Drug Summary
Enalapril is an antihypertensive medication belonging to the class of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. It primarily acts on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) to regulate blood pressure and fluid balance. Enalapril is a prodrug, metabolized in the liver to enalaprilat, its active form that inhibits ACE and reduces angiotensin II and aldosterone levels, leading to vasodilation, reduced blood pressure, and decreased blood volume. Approved by the FDA in 1985, it is indicated for managing hypertension, heart failure, and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. Enalapril's pharmacokinetics involves absorption with a peak concentration of its metabolite enalaprilat within three to four hours post oral intake, achieving steady-state by the fourth dose without notable drug accumulation except in cases of severe renal impairment.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary target of enalapril is the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which plays a crucial role in the RAAS by converting angiotensin I to the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. Inhibition of ACE leads to decreased angiotensin II levels, resulting in vasodilation, increased natriuresis, and ultimately reduced arterial pressure. Enalapril's action also results in increased bradykinin levels, potentially enhancing its therapeutic effects. While no specific enzymes are noted for enalapril metabolism beyond its conversion to enalaprilat, transporters involved include ABCB1, SLC15A1, SLC22A6, SLC22A8, and SLC22A7, which may influence its absorption and renal clearance. Enalaprilat is also known to bind to serum albumin (ALB).

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics profile of enalapril, like other ACE inhibitors, can be influenced by variations in genes encoding for its targets and transporters. For example, polymorphisms in the ACE gene may affect the drug's efficacy and the risk of adverse effects such as cough or angioedema, commonly associated with increased bradykinin levels in response to ACE inhibition. Genetic variability in transporters such as ABCB1 may alter the absorption and distribution of enalapril, affecting its pharmacokinetics and overall therapeutic outcomes. Despite the potential impact of these genetic factors, specific pharmacogenetic guidelines for enalapril use are not extensively detailed, making individual patient management critical, particularly in populations with varying ACE polymorphisms or those possessing mutations in related transporters.
