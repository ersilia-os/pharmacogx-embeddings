## Drug Summary
Sofosbuvir, marketed under brand names like Hepcinat, Hepcvir, Resof, and SoviHep, is a direct acting antiviral agent (DAA) crucial in the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection. It is particularly effective against HCV genotypes 1 through 6. Sofosbuvir operates as a prodrug that metabolizes into its active form, GS-461203, which inhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B), essential for HCV RNA replication. This drug is usually prescribed in combination therapies involving other antivirals and shows high efficacy with minimal side effects, mainly headache and fatigue. American and Canadian guidelines recommend sofosbuvir as a first-line treatment, significantly altering the treatment landscape for HCV due to its high barrier to resistance and the potential to reduce severe long-term complications, including hepatocellular carcinoma.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Sofosbuvir targets the NS5B protein of HCV, acting as a chain terminator during viral replication. The drug's metabolic process involves several enzymes: Cathepsin A (CTSA) and carboxylesterase 1 (CES1A1a) are responsible for initial cleavage of the prodrug, followed by conversion steps involving histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1), uridine monophosphate-cytidine monophosphate (UMP-CMP) kinase (CMPK1), and nucleoside diphosphate kinase A (NME1), which together activate sofosbuvir. It is also a substrate for the transporters P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1) and ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2), influencing its absorption and distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of sofosbuvir involves insights primarily from the interactions of its metabolic enzymes and transport proteins and any genomic variations that may influence these interactions. Although specific genetic markers that significantly affect sofosbuvir's pharmacokinetics and patient response are not highlighted extensively, variations in genes encoding its metabolizing enzymes (CES1A1, CTSA) and transporters like ABCB1 and ABCG2 could potentially alter drug levels and effects. Concerns also exist regarding the mutation S282T in the HCV NS5B polymerase, which confers reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir. This highlights the necessity for ongoing genetic surveillance of HCV strains to manage resistance development effectively.
