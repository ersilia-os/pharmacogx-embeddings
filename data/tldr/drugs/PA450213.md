## Drug Summary
Levodopa, also known by brand names such as Bidopal, Dopar, Doparl, Dopasol, and Dopaston, is a prodrug of dopamine used primarily in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, post-encephalitic parkinsonism, and parkinsonism due to carbon monoxide or manganese intoxication. Administered because it can cross the blood-brain barrier (which dopamine cannot), levodopa is usually combined with a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor such as carbidopa to prevent its peripheral conversion to dopamine, ensuring more levodopa reaches the brain. Once crossed into the brain, levodopa is metabolically converted to dopamine, addressing the deficient dopamine levels responsible for Parkinson's symptoms. Levodopa has various formulations, including oral inhalation powders and tablets, with different bioavailability and absorption profiles.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Levodopa acts by crossing the blood-brain barrier and being converted into dopamine by the enzyme aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase (DDC). This additional dopamine then activates several dopamine receptors, including DRD1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and DRD5, which are involved in motor control and are usually underactive in Parkinson's disease. On its metabolic path, levodopa is also influenced by transporters such as SLC15A1, SLC16A10 (monocarboxylate transporter 10), SLC7A5, and SLC7A8, which are involved in the cellular uptake of levodopa and related metabolites. Additionally, serum albumin (ALB) acts as a carrier, potentially influencing the distribution and availability of levodopa in the blood.

## Pharmacogenetics
Although specific pharmacogenetic data was not provided in the original query, the metabolism and efficacy of levodopa can be influenced by genetic variations. Commonly, genetic variants affecting the enzyme DDC may impact the conversion efficiency of levodopa to dopamine, potentially modifying drug efficacy and side effect profiles in patients. Moreover, polymorphisms in genes encoding for dopamine receptors (DRD1-5) might influence individual responses to the drug, affecting clinical outcomes in therapies for Parkinson’s disease. Additionally, variations in COMT, the enzyme which O-methylates levodopa to 3-O-methyldopa (a metabolite that cannot be converted to dopamine), can alter the therapeutic levels of bioactive levodopa and thereby patient response. Genetic testing may identify these variants, potentially guiding more personalized treatment approaches in Parkinson’s management. However, more in-depth studies and clinical trials are needed to fully establish and utilize these pharmacogenetic associations in routine clinical practice.
