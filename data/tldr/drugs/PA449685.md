## Drug Summary
Flutamide, marketed under various names including Andraxan, Curestat, and Prostanon, is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen primarily used for the management of locally confined Stage B2-C and Stage D2 metastatic carcinoma of the prostate. Its main mechanism of action involves blocking the effect of both endogenous (naturally occurring) and exogenous (external) testosterone by binding to the androgen receptor (AR). Flutamide exhibits its antiandrogenic effects by inhibiting androgen uptake and nuclear binding in target tissues, particularly the prostate, which is sensitive to androgens. The drug is rapidly and completely absorbed when administered, and is extensively metabolized quickly, with only a small fraction remaining unchanged. It has been noted to elevate plasma testosterone and estradiol levels following administration.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Flutamide acts primarily through the androgen receptor (AR), to which it binds and blocks the action of androgens. Additional targets include the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and the nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 2 (NR1I2), potentially influencing various biochemical pathways. The metabolism of flutamide involves several cytochrome P450 enzymes: CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CYP3A5, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4, which play roles in its extensive metabolic processing. Its transport through the body involves the transporter ABCC1 (Multidrug resistance-associated protein 1), which may affect the drugâ€™s distribution and elimination. There are no specific carriers listed for flutamide.

## Pharmacogenetics
Flutamide's efficacy and safety may be influenced by genetic variations in genes encoding its target and metabolic enzymes. Polymorphisms in the AR gene could alter the binding efficiency of flutamide, potentially affecting its antiandrogenic efficacy. Moreover, the metabolic enzymes such as CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 are known to have genetic variants that can significantly affect their enzymatic activity. Variants in these CYP enzymes may lead to altered drug levels, impacting both the effectiveness and toxicity of flutamide. For instance, individuals with certain CYP3A4 alleles might metabolize flutamide more slowly, leading to higher plasma concentrations and increased risk of side effects. Although specific pharmacogenetic data for flutamide is not detailed in the provided information, these are critical considerations given the roles of these enzymes in drug metabolism. Further investigation into the pharmacogenetics of flutamide could enhance personalized medicine approaches for treating prostate cancer.
