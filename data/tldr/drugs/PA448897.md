## Drug Summary
Cerivastatin, also known by brand names Lipobay and Rivastatin, is a cholesterol-lowering medication that belongs to the class of drugs known as statins. It works primarily by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a crucial role in cholesterol synthesis in the liver. Cerivastatin was used to reduce elevated levels of total cholesterol and LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb). However, it was withdrawn from the market in 2001 by Bayer Pharmaceuticals due to severe side effects, notably fatal rhabdomyolysis. The drug had a mean oral bioavailability of 60% and underwent extensive hepatic metabolism.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Cerivastatin's primary target is the enzyme HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase), which it inhibits to lower cholesterol levels. The drug is metabolized predominantly in the liver by several cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, including CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, CYP2C8, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2B6. Additionally, it is subject to glucuronidation by UGT1A1. Cerivastatin also interacts with various transporters, including ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), ABCC2 (Canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter 1), ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2), SLCO1B1 (Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1), and ABCB11 (Bile salt export pump).

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of cerivastatin is crucial given its metabolism by multiple CYP enzymes and its severe adverse effects. Variants in the genes encoding these enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, can influence the drug's metabolism and consequently its toxicity profile. Patients carrying certain alleles of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 may also experience different metabolic rates, affecting both efficacy and risk of adverse effects. Additionally, polymorphisms in transporter genes such as SLCO1B1 are associated with statin-induced myopathy, suggesting that genetic variations could influence cerivastatin's transport and toxicity. Enhanced pharmacogenetic screening could have potentially mitigated some risks associated with cerivastatin, emphasizing the importance of genetic considerations in drug prescribing and management.
