## Drug Summary
Zileuton is an asthma medication that functions primarily through the inhibition of the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme, pivotal in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes from arachidonic acid. These leukotrienes are key mediators in inflammatory processes notably exacerbating asthma symptoms such as airway edema, mucus secretion, and bronchoconstriction. Zileuton is specifically used for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in adults and children aged 12 years and older. Pharmacokinetically, it is rapidly and almost completely absorbed following oral administration, albeit with an undefined absolute bioavailability. It undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism principally through the cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Zileuton acts by selectively inhibiting the enzyme ALOX5 (Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase), which is critical in the leukotriene synthesis pathway, contributing to its anti-inflammatory effects by preventing the formation of leukotrienes LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4. Hepatic metabolism of zileuton involves several enzymes, notably CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, PTGS1 (Prostaglandin G/H synthase 1), and UGT1A9 (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-9). Moreover, zileuton and its metabolites partially bind to serum albumin (ALB), which acts as a carrier, potentially affecting its bioavailability and distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors affecting zileuton's efficacy and safety primarily involve genetic variability in the enzymes responsible for its metabolism. Polymorphisms in CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 can significantly influence the drug's plasma levels and overall therapeutic outcomes. For instance, individuals with certain genetic variants of CYP1A2 or CYP2C9 may exhibit altered enzyme activity, potentially requiring dose adjustments to mitigate increased risks of side effects or therapeutic failure. Although detailed pharmacogenetic guidelines for zileuton are not well-defined compared to other medications, understanding these genetic influences is crucial for optimizing asthma management and personalizing treatment plans. It should be noted that these inferences on pharmacogenetics are based on typical associations seen with enzyme polymorphisms and may not be explicitly documented for zileuton.
