## Drug Summary
Amisulpride, known by brand names such as Deniban and Solian, is an atypical antipsychotic medication predominantly used to manage schizophrenia. It exhibits efficacy in relieving both positive symptoms (e.g., delusions, hallucinations) and negative symptoms (e.g., emotional and social withdrawal) of schizophrenia. Amisulpride operates through selective antagonism of dopamine D2 and D3 receptors, particularly in the limbic system, which minimizes the risk of extrapyramidal side effects commonly associated with other antipsychotics. The drug is also employed as an antiemetic, particularly in its intravenous form under the brand name Barhemsys in the US, to prevent and treat postoperative nausea and vomiting. Amisulpride is characterized by a bioavailability of 48%, and its pharmacokinetics displays two peak plasma concentrations following oral administration.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Amisulpride acts primarily by antagonizing dopamine receptors, specifically the D2 and D3 subtypes, which are heavily implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and in the regulation of mood. Additionally, it has some action on serotonin receptors (5-HT2A and 5-HT7), which may contribute to its antidepressant properties. Amisulpride is minimally metabolized, with about 4% of it undergoing transformations to inactive metabolites. This drug does not significantly involve cytochrome P450 enzymes in its metabolism. In terms of transport, Amisulpride interacts with several transporters including Multidrug and Toxin Extrusion protein (MATE1 - SLC47A1 and MATE2 - SLC47A2), P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2), and the solute carrier family 22 member 1 (SLC22A1).

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of amisulpride is not extensively documented, but involvement of drug transporters such as ABCB1 and ABCG2 suggests potential genetic variations in these genes could influence drug disposition and response. For example, variants in ABCB1 and ABCG2 have been linked with altered function or expression of these proteins, potentially affecting the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of amisulpride. Moreover, since amisulpride's therapeutic action hinges on dopamine receptor antagonism, genetic variability in the DRD2 and DRD3 genes might modify patient responses and susceptibility to side effects. It is inferred that variations in genes encoding these receptors or in pathways affecting dopamine neurotransmission could be relevant to the efficacy and safety profile of amisulpride, although specific pharmacogenetic markers have yet to be formally established and utilized in clinical practice.
