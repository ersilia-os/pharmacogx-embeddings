## Drug Summary
Digoxin, also known by various names such as Agoxin, Lanoxin, and Cardioxin, is a classical cardiac glycoside derived from the Digitalis plant. It plays a significant role in the management of conditions such as mild to moderate heart failure and chronic atrial fibrillation. Approved by the FDA in 1954, digoxin enhances myocardial contraction and is therefore useful in heart failure by improving symptoms and exercise capacity. The pharmacodynamics of digoxin involves its action as a positive inotropic (increasing heart muscle contractility) and negative chronotropic (reducing heart rate) agent. This is achieved through the inhibition of the Na-K ATPase enzyme, which indirectly increases intracellular calcium levels in myocardial cells, enhancing contractility. The drug has a relatively narrow therapeutic window, which necessitates careful dosing and monitoring.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Digoxin's primary mechanism of action targets the ATP1A1 gene, which encodes the sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit alpha-1. This inhibition leads to increased intracellular sodium levels that boost cardiac contractility. The drug is predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine, and metabolism plays a minimal role, with about 13% undergoing metabolic processes such as hydrolysis, oxidation, and conjugation. Digoxin does not significantly interact with the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. However, it is a substrate for several transporters including P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), which affects its intestinal absorption and renal excretion, along with other solute carriers like SLCO4C1, ABCB11, SLCO1A2, SLC51A, and SLCO1B1 that may influence its pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of digoxin revolves around its interaction with P-glycoprotein, encoded by the ABCB1 gene. Variations in ABCB1 can affect the absorption, distribution, and elimination of digoxin, thereby influencing its efficacy and toxicity profile. For example, certain ABCB1 polymorphisms lead to altered transporter activity, which can modify plasma levels of digoxin and risk of toxicity. Noteworthy is that digoxin has a narrow therapeutic index, making understanding these genetic influences particularly important to avoid adverse effects like digoxin toxicity, which manifests as nausea, arrhythmias, and visual disturbances. Pharmacogenetic testing may guide dosage adjustments and reduce the risk of adverse effects in patients with high-risk genotypes, although specific guidelines for routine testing in digoxin therapy are still under discussion.
