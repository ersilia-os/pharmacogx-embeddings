## Drug Summary
Topiramate is an antiepileptic drug (AED) used primarily to treat seizure disorders, including both partial onset and primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and for the management of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. It is also approved for migraine prophylaxis in adults and children aged 12 and older, as well as for weight management in combination with phentermine. Topiramate acts primarily through its unique chemical structure that enhances inhibitory neurotransmission and suppresses excitatory mechanisms. This includes effects on ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors that regulate neuronal excitability. The pharmacokinetics of topiramate show it has a good oral bioavailability of about 80%, and its metabolism mainly involves glucuronidation and hydroxylation to produce minor inactive metabolites. Its absorption is not significantly affected by food, but its peak can be delayed.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Topiramate interacts with a broad range of molecular targets including multiple subunits of voltage-gated sodium channels (e.g., SCN1A, SCN2A through SCN11A), GABA-A receptors, and glutamate receptors, particularly the kainate types (GRIK1-GRIK5). It also inhibits carbonic anhydrases such as CA1, CA2, CA3, and CA4, which may contribute to its effects but are not the primary therapeutic targets. In the domain of pharmacokinetics, topiramate is metabolized predominately by CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 enzymes, and interactions at these enzymes can affect its plasma levels. It affects AMP-activated protein kinase signaling pathways, as shown by its interaction with multiple subunits (PRKAA1/2, PRKAB1/2, PRKAG1/3). Additionally, it has interaction with serum albumin (ALB), which can influence its distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of topiramate includes interactions with genotypes affecting CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, which are responsible for its metabolic clearance. Specific genetic variants in these genes can lead to altered enzyme activity resulting in significant variability in drug exposure among individuals, potentially impacting both efficacy and toxicity. Patients with certain CYP2C19 polymorphisms may exhibit either reduced or increased metabolism of topiramate, necessitating dose adjustments. Moreover, the efficacy and risk of adverse effects with topiramate may also be influenced by genetic variations in the targets it interacts with, such as SCN1A and GABRA1, though these associations are currently not well-characterized in the clinical context and require further investigation to guide personalized therapy.
