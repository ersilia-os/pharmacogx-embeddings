## Drug Summary
Caffeine, marketed under various names including Caffedrine, Dexitac, Durvitan, and others, belongs to the methylxanthine class. It is used for multiple purposes ranging from pain relief, combating drowsiness, to more specific medical applications such as treating apnea of prematurity in neonates and enhancing athletic performance. The drug works by stimulating the central nervous system, enhancing alertness, and promoting both gastric acid secretion and diuretic effects. Its therapeutic effects in the neonatal population involve the stimulation of respiratory centers and diaphragmatic movements. Caffeine has a rapid absorption profile with peak plasma concentrations achieved between 30 minutes to 2 hours post-administration, and it undergoes extensive metabolism primarily via CYP1A2 in the liver, producing metabolites like paraxanthine, theobromine, and theophylline.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Caffeine exerts its effects largely through antagonism of adenosine receptors (ADORA1, ADORA2A, ADORA2B, and ADORA3) and inhibition of various phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes, including PDE1B, PDE4D, and others, which play a role in cellular messaging and metabolic regulation. Additionally, caffeine impacts several phosphatidylinositol and ryanodine receptors, influencing intracellular calcium dynamics. In terms of metabolism, caffeine is primarily processed by CYP1A2, with contributions from CYP3A4, CYP2E1, and others, which are responsible for its biotransformation to demethylated metabolites. The drug also interacts with the transporter ABCG2, impacting its distribution and excretion.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of caffeine is notably influenced by polymorphisms in CYP1A2. For example, individuals carrying the rs762551 allele in CYP1A2 have variations in caffeine metabolism rates, which can affect both therapeutic and adverse effects, such as an increased risk for non-fatal myocardial infarction with caffeine intake. Genetic variability in CYP1A2 can lead to differences in response to caffeine, highlighting the importance of genetic factors in its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. This genetic influence necessitates consideration in both clinical settings regarding dosing and in public health advisories related to caffeine consumption.
