## Drug Summary
Leflunomide is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) approved by the FDA and other regulatory bodies since 1999 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It functions as a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor, particularly targeting the autoimmune processes characteristic of RA. Leflunomide is absorbed efficiently, with peak plasma concentrations occurring between 6-12 hours after oral administration. It is metabolized primarily in the liver, converting into its active form A77 1726. This metabolite is mainly responsible for the drug's activity, inhibiting cell proliferation and autoimmune activity by arresting T-cell cycling and reducing DNA and RNA synthesis. Leflunomide is also being used off-label for preventing rejection in organ transplantation.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Leflunomide's primary mechanism involves inhibiting the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a mitochondrial enzyme essential for the de novo pathway of pyrimidine synthesis. This inhibition leads to a reduction in ribonucleotide uridine monophosphate (rUMP), necessary for nucleic acid synthesis, thus impairing the proliferation of activated lymphocytes. Additionally, leflunomide interacts with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and protein-tyrosine kinase 2-beta (PTK2B), which play roles in immune response modulation and cellular signaling, respectively. The drug's metabolism involves cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2C9 and CYP1A2. Transport wise, leflunomide or its metabolites interact with ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2), influencing drug disposition across cellular barriers.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of leflunomide involves its interaction with genetic variants of enzymes critical in its metabolism and transport. It has been specifically reported that a genotype in CYP1A2 (rs762551) is associated with an increased risk of drug-related toxicity in patients treated with leflunomide. This suggests that individuals carrying this variant may experience higher plasma concentrations of the drug, leading to potential toxicity. Understanding this genetic influence can be crucial for tailoring leflunomide treatment to individual patient needs and improving therapeutic outcomes by minimizing adverse effects. Genetic variants of CYP2C9 might also affect the metabolism and hence the pharmacokinetics of leflunomide, although specific associations with clinical outcomes require further investigation.
