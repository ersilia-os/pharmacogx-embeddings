## Drug Summary
Acarbose, commercially known as Glucobay, Prandase, and previously Precose, is an oligosaccharide used to manage blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It belongs to the class of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors and functions by inhibiting enzymes such as pancreatic alpha-amylase and intestinal alpha-glucosidases (glucoamylase, sucrase, maltase, isomaltase). These enzymes are crucial in the breakdown of complex starches into absorbable sugars, thus acarbose reduces blood sugar spikes following meals. Acarbose is minimally absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, with less than 1-2% bioavailability. It is mainly metabolized in the gut by bacteria and digestive enzymes, producing several metabolites, some having similar inhibitory properties. The drug is primarily used as an adjunct to diet and exercise, but it is noted for its modest efficacy on A1c levels, need for multiple daily doses, and potential gastrointestinal side effects.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Acarbose's targets include several enzymes involved in the digestion of carbohydrates: MGAM (Maltase-glucoamylase which is present in the intestine), SI (sucrase-isomaltase, also in the intestine), AMY2A (pancreatic alpha-amylase), and GAA (lysosomal alpha-glucosidase). By inhibiting these targets, acarbose effectively reduces the breakdown and absorption of dietary carbohydrates, lowering postprandial glucose levels. No specific transporters or carriers are implicated in its function. The drug lacks significant systemic enzyme interactions since it acts locally in the gastrointestinal tract and has minimal systemic circulation.

## Pharmacogenetics
As of the current knowledge and the provided data, including the absence of specific genomic data in the DrugBank entry, there are no well-established pharmacogenetic factors directly influencing the efficacy or safety of acarbose. However, considering its mechanism involving carbohydrate metabolism enzymes, genetic variations in these enzymes or in genes influencing intestinal flora could hypothetically affect drug effectiveness or susceptibility to side effects. Further research into the pharmacogenetics of acarbose could provide insights into personalized dosing or risk mitigation, especially in view of the gastrointestinal side effects linked to its use.
