## Drug Summary
L-Methylfolate, also referred to as Levomefolic acid, is the biologically active form of folate used in the management of hyperhomocysteinemia and as an adjunct to antidepressants. It bypasses the steps requiring the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) in the conversion process from folic acid to its active form. This is particularly useful in individuals with genetic polymorphisms that decrease the efficiency of these enzymatic conversions. L-Methylfolate plays a crucial role in DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation, as well as neurotransmitter synthesis. It is used therapeutically both in depression, where it is believed to enhance the synthesis of monoamine neurotransmitters, and in patients with elevated homocysteine levels, which are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
As the active form of folate, L-Methylfolate primarily targets the metabolic pathways involving folate and homocysteine. It does not require activation by DHFR, thus acting independently of this enzyme. Its primary role is as a cofactor in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine by the enzyme methionine synthase (MTR), which requires Vitamin B12 as a cofactor. The pivotal role of L-Methylfolate in this metabolic pathway showcases its central involvement without the need for complex interactions with additional enzymes or transporters.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetics plays a significant role in the efficacy of L-Methylfolate, especially concerning polymorphisms in genes like MTHFR, which encodes methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase. Variants such as MTHFR C677T can lead to reduced activity of this enzyme, impairing the conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to L-Methylfolate. Individuals with the MTHFR C677T polymorphism may thus benefit from L-Methylfolate supplementation as an alternative to folic acid, which requires conversion by MTHFR. Importantly, understanding an individual's MTHFR genotype can guide the clinical use of L-Methylfolate, particularly in optimizing folate levels, managing homocysteine concentrations, and potentially enhancing the effectiveness of antidepressants in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Pharmacogenomic insights can therefore significantly impact the therapeutic strategies involving L-Methylfolate.
