## Drug Summary
Edoxaban, marketed under the DrugBank identifier DB09075, is a novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) and a selective inhibitor of factor Xa, which plays a crucial role in the coagulation cascade. It is used primarily to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Additionally, it is indicated for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) following initial therapy with a parenteral anticoagulant. Unlike warfarin, edoxaban offers advantages such as once-daily dosing and a reduced need for regular monitoring, as well as fewer interactions with food and drugs. It achieves peak plasma concentrations within 1-2 hours of oral administration, and its absolute bioavailability is 62%. The drug is not extensively metabolized by CYP3A4, resulting in minimal drug-drug interactions. However, its interaction with drugs that inhibit p-glycoprotein must be considered due to its importance in edoxaban transport across the intestinal wall.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Edoxaban functions chiefly by inhibiting factor X (F10) of the coagulation cascade, preventing the conversion of prothrombin into thrombin which is essential for clot formation. This singular target recognition underscores its specific action within the cascade. It is not metabolized significantly by hepatic enzymes, reducing potential hepatic drug-drug interactions; however, minimal metabolism occurs via hydrolysis (mainly by carboxylesterase 1), conjugation, and slight oxidation by CYP3A4. In terms of transport, edoxaban's absorption and disposition are influenced by P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), which facilitates its transport across the intestinal barrier, indicating a crucial role for this transporter in its pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, specific pharmacogenetic data related to edoxaban are not extensively detailed in the provided information or widely studied. However, known interactions with drugs that affect the activity of P-glycoprotein (ABCB1 gene product) suggest a possible area for pharmacogenetic influence. Variations in the ABCB1 gene could potentially affect the transport and, consequently, the plasma levels of edoxaban, altering its efficacy and safety profile. Despite the absence of detailed genomic data in this summary, further investigation into ABCB1 gene polymorphisms could provide significant insights into individualized patient responses to edoxaban treatment, particularly concerning drug absorption and risk of bleeding. As of now, prescribing Edoxaban generally involves consideration of renal function rather than genetic testing but understanding genetic variations could be crucial for optimizing therapy and minimizing adverse effects in the future.
