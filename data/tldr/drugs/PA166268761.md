## Drug Summary
Belzutifan, marketed under the brand name Welireg, is an inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α) primarily used in the treatment of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated cancers, such as renal cell carcinoma (RCC), central nervous system hemangioblastomas, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET) that do not require immediate surgery. Approved by the FDA in August 2021, Belzutifan functions by inhibiting the complexation of HIF-2α with HIF-1β, crucial for its activation. This mechanism helps slow or halt the growth of VHL-associated tumors. Belzutifan is administered orally once daily, showing a peak plasma concentration within one to two hours post-administration. The drug achieves steady-state pharmacokinetics after roughly three days, with its metabolism primarily via UGT2B17 and CYP2C19 enzymes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Belzutifan directly targets Endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1 (EPAS1 or HIF-2α), hindering its interaction with HIF-1β, which is vital for the transcriptional activation processes that drive tumor growth and vascularization in hypoxic conditions typical of VHL-related tumors. The drug's metabolism involves several enzymes, predominantly UGT2B17 and CYP2C19, with a lesser extent by CYP3A4, which are important for its glucuronidation and oxidation processes, respectively. Regarding transporters, Belzutifan is affected by P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), solute carrier organic anion transporter family members SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3, and Multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 2 (SLC47A2), which can influence the drug’s absorption and elimination from the body.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of Belzutifan involves enzymes UGT2B17 and CYP2C19, known to have genetic variants that can impact drug metabolism efficiency and potentially the drug’s efficacy and safety. For instance, variations in CYP2C19, which is highly polymorphic, can categorize patients as poor or extensive metabolizers, affecting the drug's plasma levels and therapeutic outcomes. Given the involvement of CYP3A4, albeit to a lesser extent, genetic variants in this enzyme could also modulate belzutifan's metabolism. Similarly, genetic variants in drug transporters like ABCB1, SLCO1B1, and SLCO1B3 could influence drug disposition and response. The pharmacogenetic aspects of Belzutifan's interaction with these proteins suggest a potential for personalized dosing strategies, although specific guidelines and clinical trials focusing on these aspects should be consulted for more precise therapeutic adjustments.
