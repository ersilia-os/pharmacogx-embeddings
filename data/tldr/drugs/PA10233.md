## Drug Summary
Voriconazole, marketed under the trade name Vfend by Pfizer, is a triazole antifungal medication primarily used to combat serious fungal infections in immunocompromised patients. The drug has proven effective against invasive candidiasis, invasive aspergillosis, and infections caused by *Scedosporium apiospermum* and *Fusarium* spp. Voriconazole operates as a fungistatic by interrupting the synthesis of ergosterol, a crucial component of the fungal cell membrane. It exhibits high oral bioavailability and undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism, predominantly involving the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. The drug's absorption can be influenced by factors such as diet, co-administered medications, and patient demographics (e.g., gender and pediatric status).

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Voriconazole targets fungal 14-alpha sterol demethylase (ERG11 or CYP51), inhibiting ergosterol synthesis essential for fungal cell membrane stability. Its extensive metabolism in humans involves several cytochrome P450 enzymes, primarily CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, with minor contributions from CYP3A5 and CYP3A7. Additionally, enzymes like FMO1 and FMO3 also participate in its metabolism. Voriconazoleâ€™s primary circulating metabolite is the N-oxide form, which results mostly from the action of these enzymes. The drug has no significant reliance on identified specific transporters or carriers.

## Pharmacogenetics
Voriconazole's effectiveness and safety are significantly influenced by genetic variations in the CYP2C19 enzyme. Variants such as rs12248560, rs4244285, and rs4986893 in CYP2C19 affect the metabolic rate of voriconazole. Carriers of the rs12248560 allele are classified as ultra-rapid metabolizers, necessitating higher doses for therapeutic effectiveness. Conversely, alleles such as rs4244285 and rs4986893 are associated with poor metabolism, which can lead to increased drug exposure and potential toxicity. Such genetic differences necessitate genotype-based dosing to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects, underlining the importance of pharmacogenetic testing in the clinical use of voriconazole.
