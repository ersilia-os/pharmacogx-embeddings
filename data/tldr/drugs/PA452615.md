## Drug Summary
Moclobemide, also marketed under the brand name Aurorix, is a reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) specifically selective for the isoform A (RIMA), primarily used in the treatment of major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. It differentiates itself from traditional irreversible MAOIs by its selective inhibition mechanism and favorable side-effect profile. By inhibiting the enzyme monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), moclobemide reduces the metabolism of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, thereby increasing their levels in the brain and improving depressive symptoms. Moclobemide is well absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract with a bioavailability of 56% which rises to about 90% at steady state due to saturation of first-pass hepatic metabolism. It has negligible anticholinergic and antihistaminic effects, which contributes to its better tolerability compared to tricyclic and other heterocyclic antidepressants.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Moclobemide primarily targets monoamine oxidase enzymes, specifically MAOA and MAOB. These enzymes play a critical role in the catabolism of monoamines, important neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. The drug's selectivity towards MAOA makes it particularly effective in elevating levels of norepinephrine and serotonin while producing fewer side effects related to tyramine intolerance, which is a common issue with non-selective MAOIs. The metabolism of moclobemide is significantly mediated by hepatic enzymes, including CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, with the drug also acting as an inhibitor of these isoenzymes as well as CYP1A2. It does not interact significantly with any transporters or carriers.

## Pharmacogenetics
Moclobemide's interaction with CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 suggests that its pharmacokinetics could be influenced by genetic variations in these enzymes. Polymorphisms in CYP2C19 can lead to varying levels of enzyme activity, typically classified into poor, intermediate, and extensive metabolizers. For individuals with reduced activity variants (poor metabolizers), moclobemide bioavailability might increase, possibly requiring dosage adjustments to mitigate the risk of adverse effects. Conversely, individuals with increased CYP2C19 activity (ultra-rapid metabolizers) may metabolize the drug too quickly, potentially reducing its efficacy. Similarly, genetic polymorphisms affecting CYP2D6 activity could alter the metabolic profile of moclobemide, impacting its therapeutic outcomes and side effects. However, specific guidelines for dose adjustment based on genetic makeup are not ubiquitously established, highlighting a potential area for personalized medicine approaches in the treatment based on the patient's genetic profile.
