## Drug Summary
Maralixibat, also known by its brand name Livmarli, is an inhibitor of the ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT). It is specifically indicated for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with Alagille syndrome. Approved by the FDA in September 2021, maralixibat was the first treatment for this indication, a welcomed development considering previous interventions consisted of non-specific symptomatic treatments or surgical options. Pharmacodynamically, maralixibat functions by reducing the reabsorption of bile acids in the intestine, which helps to decrease serum bile acids believed to contribute to pruritus in Alagille syndrome. This drug is administered orally once daily and has demonstrated moderate duration and a wide therapeutic index, where high single doses have been tolerated without serious adverse effects.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Maralixibat specifically targets the SLC10A2, also known as the ileal sodium/bile acid cotransporter (IBAT), inhibiting the reabsorption of bile acids. This is central to its mechanism in reducing the symptoms of cholestatic pruritus. Additionally, maralixibat involves interaction with the enzyme cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), suggesting that it may be subject to metabolism by this widespread enzyme, which is known to metabolize many other drugs. The drug also interacts with the transporter SLCO2B1, a solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 2B1, which could influence its transport within the body. No specific carriers were mentioned in the available data.

## Pharmacogenetics
Given the interactions with prominent metabolic pathways such as CYP3A4, maralixibat might exhibit pharmacogenetic variability based on individual differences in the expression or activity of this enzyme, although specific pharmacogenetic data were not provided in the summary. Generally, variations in CYP3A4 activity can significantly affect the metabolism and efficacy of drugs, suggesting potential individual differences in responses to maralixibat that could be explored in further research. Additionally, since transport proteins like SLCO2B1 are involved, genetic variants affecting these proteins could also influence the drugâ€™s pharmacokinetics and overall therapeutic outcomes. Such pharmacogenetic considerations could be important for optimizing treatment regimens and managing side effects more effectively in the future.
