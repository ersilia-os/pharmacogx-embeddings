## Drug Summary
Lorazepam, marketed under various names such as Almazine, Anxiedin, and Temesta, is a short-acting benzodiazepine primarily used as a sedative and anxiolytic. Introduced in the United States in 1977 by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals and first approved by the FDA in 1985, lorazepam acts quickly and is cleared from the body rapidly. It is primarily indicated for the short-term relief of anxiety symptoms and for use as a premedication for anesthesia to induce relaxation and amnesia. Additionally, lorazepam is employed in controlling status epilepticus and has several off-label uses including the management of alcohol withdrawal symptoms and in chemotherapy-induced nausea. The pharmacodynamics of lorazepam involve potentiation of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) neurotransmission, which has widespread inhibitory effects on the nervous system, thereby enhancing sedation, conferring anti-anxiety, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxing properties. Lorazepam is well-absorbed orally with an absolute bioavailability of 90% and undergoes extensive metabolism mainly in the liver.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Lorazepam acts on the central nervous system primarily by enhancing the effects of GABA, a major inhibitory neurotransmitter, through allosteric modulation of the GABA-A receptors. These receptors are composed of different subunits (such as GABRA1 through GABRA6, GABRB1 through GABRB3, GABRD, GABRE, GABRG1 through GABRG3, GABRP, and GABRQ), and lorazepam specifically binds to these receptors' benzodiazepine sites, thereby increasing the frequency of chloride ion-channels opening, leading to hyperpolarization and stabilization of the neuronal membrane. In metabolism, lorazepam is processed by hepatic enzymes including CYP3A4 and is extensively conjugated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B15 (UGT2B15), leading to the formation of a glucuronide which is an inactive metabolite eliminated predominantly via the kidneys. No significant transporter or carrier-mediated processes are noted in the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses to lorazepam can vary based on genetic differences, although specific high-impact variations in pharmacogenomic profiles aren't very pronounced with benzodiazepines as compared to other classes of drugs. However, genetic polymorphisms in CYP3A4 and UGT2B15 enzymes, which are involved in the metabolism of lorazepam, can influence its clearance and, consequently, its dosing and risk of side effects. For instance, individuals with certain polymorphic variants of CYP3A4 that lead to reduced enzyme activity may experience prolonged sedative effects. However, currently, there is no standardized genetic testing recommended in clinical settings specifically tailored for lorazepam treatment. Recommendations for clinical use still largely rely on observing patient response and adjusting doses accordingly rather than the genetic makeup guiding initial prescription practices.
