## Drug Summary
Glipizide, marketed under various names including Glucotrol® and Metaglip®, is a second-generation oral hypoglycemic agent in the sulfonylurea class, essential for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus. Introduced in 1984 and FDA approved in 1994, it enhances glycemic control in conjunction with diet and exercise. Glipizide operates predominantly by stimulating insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells, a process heavily reliant on the functioning of these cells. Pharmacokinetically, it is characterized by a rapid and complete gastrointestinal absorption, a factor contributing to its quick onset of action, usually within 30 minutes post-administration. Metabolized primarily in the liver, its major metabolites are pharmacologically inactive. The drug's action not only promotes increased peripheral glucose utilization but also reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis, which combined with its short half-life, minimizes the risks of prolonged hypoglycemia.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Residing at the core of glipizide's mechanism are its interactions primarily with ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 8 (ABCC8), which impacts pancreatic beta-cell plasma membranes facilitating insulin secretion. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) is another significant target involved in glucose metabolism. Metabolically, glipizide is primarily broken down by hepatic enzymes including cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-1 (UGT1A1). The drug also interacts with specific transporters and carriers: the bile salt export pump (ABCB11) and serum albumin (ALB), respectively, which may influence its distribution and excretion.

## Pharmacogenetics
Glipizide pharmacogenetics primarily centers on the genomic variant in CYP2C9 (rs1057910). This allele impacts enzyme activity attributed to CYP2C9, with variant carriers demonstrating a reduced metabolism of glipizide. This pharmacokinetic alteration could necessitate dosage adjustments to prevent adverse effects like hypoglycemia. Although the pharmacogenomic landscape for glipizide isn't extensively mapped compared to other drugs, understanding the influence of specific genetic variations like that in CYP2C9 is pivotal for optimizing therapeutic outcomes and personalizing treatment plans for patients with type 2 diabetes.
