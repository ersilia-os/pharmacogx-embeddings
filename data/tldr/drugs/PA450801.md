## Drug Summary
Paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used to manage various psychiatric conditions such as depression, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It is also prescribed for the vasomotor symptoms of menopause. Paroxetine functions primarily by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin at the synaptic cleft, thus enhancing serotonergic neurotransmission, and has minimal effects on other neurotransmitters. The drug is quickly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but exhibits a reduced bioavailability of 30-60% due to first-pass metabolism. The onset of therapeutic effects typically appears after about 6 weeks of treatment.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Paroxetine's primary target is the serotonin transporter (SERT or SLC6A4), where it acts to inhibit serotonin reuptake, augmenting serotonin levels in the synaptic cleft. It also interacts with various other receptors at higher concentrations, including noradrenaline transporters (SLC6A2), multiple subtypes of adrenergic receptors (ADRA1A, ADRA1B, ADRA1D, ADRA2A, ADRA2B, ADRA2C, ADRB1, ADRB2, ADRB3), dopamine receptors (DRD2), histamine H1 receptors (HRH1), multiple serotonin receptor subtypes (e.g., HTR2A, HTR1A), and muscarinic cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM2, CHRM3, CHRM4, CHRM5). It is metabolized primarily in the liver, involving multiple enzymes, chiefly CYP2D6 and also CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2C9. The drug is a substrate of the P-glycoprotein transporter (ABCB1).

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic variability significantly influences paroxetine's efficacy and safety. Gene polymorphisms in CYP2D6, which metabolizes paroxetine, are particularly relevant. Individuals with reduced or poor metabolizer status due to alleles such as rs35742686, rs3892097, rs5030655, rs1135824, and rs28371733 potentially experience increased plasma concentrations of the drug, leading to heightened adverse effects and diminished therapeutic outcomes. Additionally, polymorphism in ABCB1 (rs2032583) has been associated with variable antidepressant response, indicating an increased likelihood of remission in major depressive disorder when treated with paroxetine. These genetic influences underscore the need for personalized approaches in prescribing paroxetine, considering specific genotypic profiles to optimize treatment efficacy and reduce adverse effects.
