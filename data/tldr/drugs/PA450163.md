## Drug Summary
Lamivudine, known under various brand names including Epivir and Zeffix, is a synthetic nucleoside analogue used primarily in the treatment of HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and chronic hepatitis B (HBV). It functions as a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, disrupting viral DNA synthesis essential for viral replication. Lamivudine is characterized by its mechanism where it is phosphorylated intracellularly to an active triphosphate metabolite, which competes for incorporation into viral DNA, thus terminating the DNA strand elongation. Pharmacokinetically, lamivudine shows high bioavailability and rapid absorption when administered orally, although its absorption rate decreases when taken with food. The drug undergoes minimal metabolism, primarily into a trans-sulfoxide metabolite, and renal clearance is the major elimination pathway.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Lamivudine acts specifically on the reverse transcriptase enzyme of HIV-1 and the HBV polymerase through its targets 'pol' for HIV-1 and 'Protein P' for HBV. The drug's active metabolite inhibits these enzymes, resulting in premature DNA chain termination. Enzymes involved in the phosphorylation of lamivudine include deoxycytidine kinase (DCK), UMP-CMP kinase (CMPK1), and others that facilitate its activation and function. Additionally, various transporters such as the Multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs, example ABCC1, ABCC2, ABCC3, and ABCC4), ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABCG2), and Solute Carrier Family proteins (SLC22A1, SLC22A2, SLC22A3, SLC22A6) are associated with the transport of lamivudine within the cell. Albumin (ALB) serves as a carrier protein, indicating interactions within the plasma.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is considerable interest in the pharmacogenetic aspects of lamivudine treatment, particularly relating to variations in drug metabolism and transport mechanisms that can affect drug efficacy and safety. Genetic polymorphisms in enzymes like DCK, which are crucial for the phosphorylation (activation) of the drug, can lead to variable therapeutic outcomes. Similarly, polymorphisms in transport proteins like ABCC1 or SLC22A1 might influence lamivudine's plasma levels and intracellular concentrations, potentially impacting its therapeutic effectiveness and toxicity profile. While specific guideline-informing alleles linked to lamivudine pharmacogenetics are not well-documented in the provided data, literature sources such as PharmGKB and various clinical studies could offer insights into how genomic variations influence responses to lamivudine.
