## Drug Summary
Flurbiprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAIA) of the propionic acid class, used mainly for its anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. Structurally and pharmacologically related to fenoprofen, ibuprofen, and ketoprofen, flurbiprofen is employed in the symptomatic treatment of conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, anklylosing spondylitis, and for pain relief in cases like dysmenorrhea and soft tissue trauma. Additionally, topical ophthalmic formulations are used pre-operatively to inhibit intraoperative miosis. Flurbiprofen, being a racemic mixture of (+)S- and (-)R-enantiomers, shows absorption peaks between 0.5 - 4 hours following oral administration with hepatic metabolism predominately by CYP2C9 into a major, less active metabolite, 4'-hydroxy-flurbiprofen.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary mechanism of flurbiprofen involves the inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, COX-1 (PTGS1) and COX-2 (PTGS2), thereby reducing the synthesis of prostaglandins that are key in the mediation of inflammation and pain. Metabolism of flurbiprofen is largely facilitated by cytochrome P450 enzyme, CYP2C9, along with several UDP-glucuronosyltransferases including UGT2B7, UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B4, aiding in its glucuronidation. Transporters such as Multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (ABCC4) and Solute carrier family 22 member 6 (SLC22A6) are involved in its cellular transport. The drug is also known to bind to serum albumin (ALB), impacting its distribution within the body.

## Pharmacogenetics
Flurbiprofenâ€™s metabolism involving CYP2C9 is of particular pharmacogenetic interest because genetic polymorphisms in this enzyme can significantly affect the drug's pharmacokinetics and overall patient response. Variants in the CYP2C9 gene can lead to reduced enzymatic activity, thus potentially increasing the risk of adverse effects due to higher plasma concentrations of flurbiprofen in individuals with such genotypes. Furthermore, inter-individual variations in UGT enzymes could also influence the extent of flurbiprofen glucuronidation, thereby altering its elimination. Although specific pharmacogenetic guidelines for flurbiprofen are not well-established, understanding of these genetic factors can assist in optimizing individual dosing and minimizing toxicity risks, especially in poly-medicated or vulnerable populations.
