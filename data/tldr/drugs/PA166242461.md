## Drug Summary
Dihydrostreptomycin, also known by its trade name Panstreptin, is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. Although aminoglycosides are generally used to combat a wide range of bacterial infections, the use of dihydrostreptomycin in human medicine is restricted due to its association with ototoxicity, which can lead to hearing loss and balance issues. The FDA has withdrawn approval for all drug products containing dihydrostreptomycin sulfate, which underscores the significance of its adverse effects. Details on its pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics specific to humans are not typically emphasized, given its limited clinical use.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The specific molecular targets, enzymes, transporters, and carriers associated with dihydrostreptomycin are not detailed in the provided DrugBank entry. Typically, aminoglycosides like dihydrostreptomycin function by binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, interfering with protein synthesis and eventually leading to bacterial cell death. However, further specifics on this drugâ€™s action at the molecular level, especially within humans, are not provided.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is no explicit pharmacogenetic data available for dihydrostreptomycin from the DrugBank entry provided. Aminoglycosides in general may have interactions based on genetic variability in their targets or in genes encoding metabolic enzymes, but specific interactions for dihydrostreptomycin are not well documented in the pharmacogenetics literature. Notably, ototoxicity, a major adverse effect of aminoglycosides, has been linked to genetic variants in mitochondrial DNA among other genes, though specific data linking these variants to dihydrostreptomycin is lacking. Further research might elucidate specific genetic predispositions that influence the risk and severity of ototoxicity or other adverse effects from dihydrostreptomycin.
