## Drug Summary
Amoxapine, known under various brand names like Asendin and Defanyl, is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) of the dibenzoxazepine class, distinct from other TCAs by its chemical structure. It is primarily used to treat various types of depression, including neurotic, reactive, and psychotic depression, often accompanied by anxiety or agitation. Amoxapine acts by inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin, thereby increasing their levels in the central nervous system. It has quick absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, achieving peak plasma concentrations within 1-2 hours after oral administration. Metabolism occurs almost entirely in the liver, yielding pharmacologically inactive metabolites. The drug can lead to severe toxicity in cases of overdose, notably causing grand mal convulsions and potentially coma or renal failure.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Amoxapine interacts with a variety of targets that contribute to its pharmacological effects. Key targets include the sodium-dependent serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) and the sodium-dependent noradrenaline transporter (SLC6A2), which are crucial for its antidepressant action. It also interacts with dopamine receptors (DRD1-D4), various subtypes of alpha-adrenergic (ADRA1A/D, ADRA2A/B/C), and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1-5). Additionally, it affects multiple histamine (HRH1/H4) and serotonin receptor subtypes (HTR1-7) along with a broad spectrum of GABA(A) receptor subunits (GABRA/B/D/E/G/P/Q). It is metabolized primarily by CYP2D6. Amoxapine does not appear to significantly interact with any specific transporters but binds to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (ORM1), which may influence its distribution and pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetics plays a crucial role in the efficacy and safety of amoxapine, particularly concerning its metabolism through CYP2D6, a highly polymorphic enzyme. Variations in CYP2D6 activity can significantly affect the drug's plasma levels and, consequently, its therapeutic outcomes and risk of adverse effects. Individuals with reduced CYP2D6 function ("poor metabolizers") may experience heightened exposure to amoxapine, increasing the likelihood of toxic effects, whereas those with enhanced enzyme activity ("ultra-rapid metabolizers") may require higher doses to achieve efficacy. Currently, no specific pharmacogenetic guidelines exist for amoxapine's use, but monitoring its effects and adjusting doses based on clinical response and side effects is advisable, particularly in populations known to have a higher prevalence of CYP2D6 variants.
