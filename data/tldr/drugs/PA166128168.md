## Drug Summary
Asunaprevir, known as BMS-650032, is a potent inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protease, crucial for viral replication. Approved by Health Canada in 2016, it targets HCV genotypes 1 and 4 in adult patients with compensated liver cirrhosis. Asunaprevir is used in combination therapies, notably with daclatasvir, especially effective in genotypes predominant in the United States. It was briefly marketed but discontinued in 2017. Following oral administration, asunaprevir is rapidly absorbed, showing a high liver-to-plasma concentration ratio. Its pharmacokinetics are dose-proportional, with variable bioavailability enhanced by food intake.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Asunaprevir specifically inhibits the NS3 protease enzyme in HCV, preventing the cleavage of viral polyprotein into functional units necessary for viral replication. The drug metabolizes predominantly in the liver through oxidative reactions mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, with minor involvement from CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 enzymes. In terms of transport, asunaprevir interacts with solute carrier organic anion transporters (SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, SLCO2B1) and the P-glycoprotein transporter (ABCB1).

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic aspects of asunaprevir involve its metabolism, primarily via CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes. Variants in these genes can affect the drug's metabolism, potentially altering its efficacy and safety profile. For example, individuals with polymorphisms in CYP3A5 may exhibit different metabolic rates, influencing drug concentrations and response. Transporters such as SLCO1B1 and ABCB1 also play roles in pharmacogenetics; variants in these genes might impact the drug's absorption and distribution, which could necessitate dosage adjustments. Although there is no direct clinical data linking specific genetic variants with asunaprevir response in the provided details, these genes are known to be relevant in the pharmacogenetics of other similar agents, suggesting potential implications for asunaprevir.
