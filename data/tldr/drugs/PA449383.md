## Drug Summary
Docetaxel is an anti-mitotic chemotherapy drug extensively used to treat various cancers such as breast, non-small cell lung, prostate, gastric adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. It belongs to the taxoid class of antineoplastic agents. Docetaxel works by promoting microtubule assembly from tubulin dimers and stabilizing them, which inhibits their normal dynamic reorganization necessary for cell functions and division, leading to cell death. Its mechanism involves binding to the Î²-subunit of tubulin, essentially freezing microtubules in place, disrupting cellular functions and inducing apoptosis, particularly through interfering with the function of the Bcl-2 protein. Administered intravenously, docetaxel exhibits a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model with metabolism primarily occurring in the liver via CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Docetaxel interacts with several cellular targets including Tubulin beta-1 chain (TUBB1), Microtubule-associated proteins MAP2, MAP4, and MAPT, and the apoptosis regulator Bcl-2 (BCL2). It is metabolized predominantly by the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes, with minor involvement from CYP3A7 and CYP1B1. Docetaxel is also a substrate for various transporters including P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), multiple drug resistance-associated proteins like ABCC10, ABCC2, and ABCC1, and solute carriers such as SLCO1B3 and SLC22A7. Its interaction with these proteins affects both the efficacy and toxicity profile of the drug.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of docetaxel has shown significant associations between genetic variations and patient responses. Importantly, polymorphisms in the ABCC2 gene, such as rs12762549, have been linked to increased risks of drug-induced leukopenia and neutropenia. This underscores the importance of considering genetic screening prior to docetaxel therapy to anticipate adverse effects and adjust dosages accordingly. The drug's metabolism by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 further suggests that variations in these genes might affect docetaxel's pharmacokinetics and toxicity, potentially impacting therapeutic outcomes. However, detailed pharmacogenomic profiling is recommended to optimize personalized treatment plans and mitigate risks.
