## Drug Summary
Sotorasib, marketed under the brand name Lumakras, is a small molecule KRAS inhibitor specifically targeting the KRAS G12C mutation. This mutation is present in about 13% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) as well as lower frequencies in other solid tumors such as colorectal cancer. Sotorasib acts by binding to a mutated cysteine residue on KRAS G12C, effectively locking KRAS in its inactive GDP-bound state, which inhibits downstream signaling through the MAP kinase pathway critical for cell proliferation and survival. It is approved for the treatment of KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in adults who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. Sotorasib has a moderate duration of action, requiring daily administration. Its systemic exposure at 960 mg doses exhibits a peak concentration of 7.5 µg/mL after approximately 2 hours, and its metabolism is primarily via conjugation and several cytochrome P450 enzymes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Sotorasib specifically targets the GTPase KRas protein, which is a key component of the MAP kinase signaling pathway. Alterations in KRAS are implicated in numerous cancers, making it a significant therapeutic target. The biotransformation of Sotorasib occurs predominantly through certain cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and others, such as CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2B6. Additionally, transport proteins like ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2) and ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1) are involved in the pharmacokinetics of Sotorasib, possibly affecting its distribution and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of Sotorasib emphasizes its efficacy in tumors harboring the KRAS G12C mutation, a genetic alteration that predisposes the protein to constant activation, promoting oncogenesis. The specific targeting by Sotorasib highlights the importance of genetic testing for appropriate patient selection in NSCLC therapy. While no specific genetic markers have been mentioned for variability in its metabolism or transport, the involvement of multiple CYP450 enzymes suggests potential pharmacogenetic considerations regarding drug levels and safety based on individual genetic variability in these enzymes. Variants in these genes like CYP3A5*3 or CYP2C8*3 could influence drug metabolism, affecting both efficacy and toxicity profiles, although direct references and clinical guidelines regarding these pathways’ influence on Sotorasib pharmacokinetics and response currently require further empirical validation and research literature support.
