## Drug Summary
Butorphanol, marketed under names such as Butaro and Butrum, belongs to the class of synthetic opioid analgesics, particularly functioning as an agonist-antagonist. This drug is commonly utilized for the management and relief of moderate to severe pain. It was first introduced for parenteral use in 1978, and recently, a transnasal formulation has been developed. This alternative route of administration provides advantages by bypassing first-pass metabolism, a significant factor since the drug is heavily metabolized in the liver after oral intake. Rapid absorption characterizes butorphanol after intramuscular injection, with peak plasma levels achieved within 20-40 minutes. The oral bioavailability of butorphanol is notably low (5-17%) due to extensive first-pass metabolism.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Butorphanol interacts with opioid receptors in the central nervous system, predominantly involving the μ-opioid receptor (OPRM1), κ-opioid receptor (OPRK1), and less so with the δ-opioid receptor (OPRD1). These interactions are believed to modulate its analgesic and narcotic antagonist activities, where butorphanol exhibits both agonist and antagonist effects at these receptors. The drug does not specifically target enzymes, transporters, or carriers according to the provided data.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of butorphanol is largely underexplored in human studies, and no specific genomic data from DrugBank is provided. However, general pharmacogenetic principles suggest variability in butorphanol's efficacy and safety could be influenced by genetic variations in opioid receptors (such as OPRM1, OPRK1, and OPRD1) and in metabolic enzymes. Although not directly documented for butorphanol, polymorphisms in the genes encoding these receptors and metabolic enzymes like cytochrome P450s could potentially alter drug response, including effects on analgesia or risk of adverse effects. These interactions represent areas for future research and are currently inferred based on broader opioid pharmacogenetics knowledge. Further research could help tailor butorphanol use to individual genetic profiles, potentially improving therapeutic outcomes and reducing the risk of toxicity.
