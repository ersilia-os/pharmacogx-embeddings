## Drug Summary
Oxcarbazepine is an anticonvulsant medication primarily used to treat partial-onset seizures in both adults and children. Approved in the United States in 2000, it acts mainly through its metabolite, MHD (10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxy-carbamazepine), which is more pharmacologically active. Oxcarbazepine has a structural similarity to carbamazepine but is distinguished by its unique metabolism primarily via reduction, rather than through the cytochrome P450 system, reducing its drug-drug interaction profile. It demonstrates effectiveness by targeting voltage-gated sodium channels, stabilizing hyperexcited nerve membranes, and reducing repetitive neuronal firing and propagation of seizure activity.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Oxcarbazepine and its active metabolite MHD exert their antiepileptic effects primarily through the inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels, including various subtypes (SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN3A, SCN4A, SCN5A, SCN8A, SCN9A, and others). This action aids in the stabilization of neuronal membranes and dampening of excessive neural activity typical in seizure conditions. Metabolism of oxcarbazepine is principally facilitated by aldo-keto reductases (AKR1C1, AKR1C2, AKR1C3, AKR1C4, CBR1, and CBR3), producing the active MHD. The drug and its metabolites are also substrates for transport proteins like P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and are bound in the plasma by carriers such as serum albumin (ALB).

## Pharmacogenetics
Genetic variants particularly within the HLA gene locus such as HLA-B*1502 and HLA-A*3101 have been associated with increased risk of severe dermatological reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis) in patients treated with oxcarbazepine. These alleles are more prevalent in certain ethnic groups, suggesting a genotypic influence on the risk for these adverse effects. Patients carrying these alleles should be monitored closely or alternative treatments should be considered. Moreover, while oxcarbazepine is less affected by cytochrome P450 polymorphisms due to its unique metabolism, variations in aldo-keto reductases and other metabolic enzymes could potentially influence drug efficacy and safety, though specific interactions are less documented and warrant further research.
