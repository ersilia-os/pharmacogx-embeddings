## Drug Summary
Rocuronium, also known under the brand names Esmeron and Zemuron, is an aminosteroid non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker used in modern anesthesia. It facilitates rapid sequence and routine tracheal intubation and provides skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation. Introduced in 1994, Rocuronium has a rapid to intermediate onset and duration of action depending on the dose. It operates by competing with acetylcholine for nicotinic cholinergic receptors at the motor end-plate, thus inhibiting depolarization and muscle contraction. Rocuronium is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is primarily metabolized in the liver to a less active metabolite, 17-desacetyl-rocuronium.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Rocuronium targets several receptors, including the neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-2 (CHRNA2), muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2 (CHRM2), and the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3A (HTR3A). These receptors are involved in muscle contraction and neurotransmitter release. The drug is not significantly metabolized by any specific enzymes but is transported by solute carrier family 22 member 1 (SLC22A1) and solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1A2 (SLCO1A2), which may involve in its distribution and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
No specific genomic data or pharmacogenetic associations are provided for Rocuronium from the provided DrugBank information, and there is currently limited research directly linking genetic variations with Rocuronium pharmacokinetics and dynamics. However, considering its mechanism of action involving cholinergic receptors, genetic variants in corresponding receptor genes (e.g., CHRNA2, CHRM2) could hypothetically influence the drug's efficacy or safety profile. Pharmacogenetic research in this area could potentially reveal important predictors of patient response to Rocuronium.
