## Drug Summary
Fluvastatin, marketed under the names Canef and Cranoc, is a synthetic statin class medication primarily used to manage hypercholesterolemia and prevent cardiovascular diseases. As an antilipemic agent, Fluvastatin competitively inhibits hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, a key enzyme in the hepatic synthesis of cholesterol. This drug is distinct in its complete synthesis and structural uniqueness compared to other statins which are typically derivatives of fungal compounds. The pharmacodynamics of Fluvastatin involve a reduction in cholesterol and triglycerides, particularly targeting LDL cholesterol by blocking the conversion of HMG-CoA into mevalonate, a cholesterol precursor. It is characterized by high absorption with more than 90% initially absorbed but with a low bioavailability (around 24%) due to significant first-pass metabolism. Fluvastatin is predominantly metabolized in the liver mainly via CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4 and CYP2C8.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Fluvastatin primarily targets HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), inhibiting this enzyme to reduce cholesterol biosynthesis. Additionally, it has interactions with histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), although the clinical significance of this interaction is less understood. It is metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and CYP2C8, with lesser contributions from CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and others. Phase II metabolism involves UGT enzymes such as UGT1A1 and UGT2B7. Important transporters involved with Fluvastatin include SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3, which are part of the solute carrier organic anion transporter family, crucial for its hepatic uptake and biliary excretion.

## Pharmacogenetics
Fluvastatinâ€™s pharmacogenomics is especially pertinent due to its metabolism largely by CYP2C9, with known genetic polymorphisms affecting this enzyme's activity. Variants in CYP2C9 can lead to altered metabolism rates, influencing both the efficacy and toxicity of Fluvastatin. Patients with reduced function alleles may have higher plasma levels, increasing the risk of adverse effects like myopathy. SLCO1B1 polymorphisms also play a role in the pharmacokinetics of Fluvastatin. Specific variants in SLCO1B1 can affect the transporter's efficiency, impacting drug levels and potentially leading to an increased risk of statin-induced side effects. It is recommended that genetic testing be considered in cases of unexpected therapeutic outcomes or adverse reactions to personalize Fluvastatin therapy, though clear guidelines on genotyping prior to initiation are not universally established.
