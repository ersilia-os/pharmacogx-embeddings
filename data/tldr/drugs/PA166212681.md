## Drug Summary
Piritramide, also known by brand names Dipidolor and Piridolan, is a synthetic opioid analgesic. It is primarily used for the management of severe pain, particularly in the postoperative setting. Although the details on its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the provided DrugBank information are not available, piritramide is known to exert its analgesic effects through opioid receptors, similar to other opioids. Piritramide has been investigated not only for postoperative pain but also for postoperative nausea and vomiting. Furthermore, there are investigations into its potential applications in the treatment of colon cancer and addressing minimal residual disease, although these are still under research with no concrete indications provided yet.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The specific targets, enzymes, transporters, and carriers associated with piritramide are not detailed in the provided DrugBank information. Generally, opioids function by binding to and activating the mu-opioid receptor, leading to an inhibition of ascending pain pathways, alteration in the perception of pain, and an increase in pain tolerance. The metabolism pathway, major enzymes involved in its biotransformation, and any key transporters or carriers that might influence its distribution or excretion remain unspecified and would require further detailing from additional sources or research.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of piritramide is not explicitly detailed in the available info from DrugBank. In general, the efficacy and safety of opioids can be influenced by genetic variations, especially in genes encoding opioid receptors and enzymes involved in opioid metabolism such as CYP450 enzymes. For instance, variations in the OPRM1 gene, which encodes the mu-opioid receptor, can alter receptor binding and influence analgesic effects as well as side effects profile. Additionally, genetic differences in drug-metabolizing enzymes such as CYP2D6 can affect the rates of drug metabolism, leading to variability in drug levels and responses. However, specific pharmacogenetics data for piritramide would need to be confirmed through targeted genetic studies or clinical pharmacogenetic testing.
