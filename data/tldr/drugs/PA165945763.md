## Drug Summary
Cangrelor is an intravenous antiplatelet medication specifically used as an adjunct in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to mitigate risks such as periprocedural myocardial infarction, repeat coronary revascularization, and stent thrombosis, particularly in patients who have not previously received P2Y12 platelet inhibitor treatment. Approved by the FDA in June 2015, Cangrelor distinguishes itself from oral P2Y12 inhibitors like clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor by being a directly-acting, reversible agent that doesn't require metabolic activation. This quality enables Cangrelor to provide rapid onset and offset of its antiplatelet effects, which is crucial in acute settings such as during PCI.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Cangrelor exerts its antiplatelet effect by targeting the P2Y12 receptor, a critical component in the ADP-induced platelet aggregation pathway. The drug operates as a selective and reversible antagonist at this site, effectively blocking the binding of ADP, which is a potent platelet activator released by damaged blood vessels and platelets. This mechanism is akin to that of other irreversible P2Y12 inhibitors, but Cangrelor's reversibility allows for quick cessation of its effects, which is advantageous in managing bleeding risks post-PCI. There are no significant interactions involving metabolic enzymes, transporters, or carriers, as Cangrelor is deactivated rapidly in the circulation through dephosphorylation, leading to a metabolite with negligible anti-platelet activity.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, specific pharmacogenetic data regarding Cangrelor is not extensively documented or available. However, it is known that the drugâ€™s action and metabolism do not depend on the hepatic enzymes typically involved in the metabolism of other drugs, suggesting a lower likelihood of pharmacogenetic variations commonly seen with other medications where hepatic enzymes like CYP450 play a significant role. Furthermore, as it is a direct P2Y12 inhibitor, genetic variations influencing the receptor's structure or expression could theoretically alter the drug's efficacy or safety profile, although such associations have not yet been robustly established or reported in literature.
