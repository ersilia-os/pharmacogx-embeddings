## Drug Summary
Dolasetron, also known under brand names Anemet and Zamanon, is an antinauseant and antiemetic medication primarily used to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy and postoperative recovery. It functions as a highly specific and selective antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor. Chemotherapeutic agents and surgical procedures may trigger the release of serotonin, which stimulates the 5-HT3 receptors in both the peripheral (enterochromaffin cells in the GI tract) and central (area postrema and chemoreceptor trigger zone of the medulla) locations, initiating nausea and vomiting. Dolasetron, by blocking these receptors, effectively prevents these symptoms. The oral form of dolasetron is well-absorbed, and its pharmacological effects are mainly due to its major active metabolite, hydrodolasetron, which is produced through rapid hepatic metabolism.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Dolasetron acts by targeting and antagonizing the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3A (HTR3A), effectively blocking the receptor’s action in the chemoreceptor trigger zone and the peripheral nervous system, thereby mitigating nausea and vomiting reflexes. The metabolism of dolasetron involves several cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4. These enzymes are responsible for the hepatic conversion of dolasetron into its active metabolite, hydrodolasetron, which then exerts the therapeutic effects. There are no significant interactions involving transporters or carriers listed for dolasetron, indicating that its primary pharmacological interactions occur at the level of receptor antagonism and hepatic metabolism.

## Pharmacogenetics
While comprehensive genomic data specific to dolasetron were not reported, the involvement of enzymes such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 in its metabolism suggests potential pharmacogenetic considerations. Variability in these genes can influence the metabolic rate and, consequently, the efficacy and toxicity of dolasetron. For instance, individuals with certain polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 gene that result in poor metabolizer phenotypes may have altered processing of dolasetron, potentially leading to differences in drug levels and effects. Similarly, variations in CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 could affect the drug’s metabolism and its therapeutic outcomes. These pharmacogenetic factors can be crucial in personalizing dolasetron dosing to maximize efficacy and minimize adverse effects, although specific guidelines for genotyping prior to dolasetron use are not currently established.
