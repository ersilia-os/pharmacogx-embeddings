## Drug Summary
Zafirlukast is an oral leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) used primarily in the maintenance treatment of asthma. It functions by selectively antagonizing cysteinyl leukotriene receptors (specifically CysLT1), which play a significant role in the pathophysiology of asthma including bronchoconstriction, mucus production, and airway inflammation. Zafirlukast is typically dosed twice daily and is indicated for both prophylaxis and chronic management of asthma. The drug is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, although its absorption is diminished by high-fat or high-protein meals. Metabolism occurs primarily in the liver via various cytochrome P450 enzymes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Zafirlukast specifically targets the Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CYSLTR1) which mediates the inflammatory actions of leukotrienes in the respiratory tract, essential for managing asthma symptoms. The metabolism of zafirlukast involves several cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and PTGS1, indicating extensive hepatic processing. Additionally, zafirlukast is influenced by transporters such as ABCG2, an ATP-binding cassette which potentially affects the drugâ€™s bioavailability, and SLC10A1, involved in bile acid transportation, possibly impacting drug disposition.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic considerations for zafirlukast largely involve its metabolism through pathways involving multiple CYP450 enzymes, which show genetic polymorphism across different individuals. For instance, genetic variations in CYP2C9, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4 can alter the metabolic rate of zafirlukast, potentially affecting both efficacy and toxicity. Decreased function alleles in these enzymes could hypothetically lead to increased plasma levels of zafirlukast, intensifying both therapeutic and adverse effects. As such, genotyping could be beneficial in optimizing zafirlukast dosing. However, specific genotype-guided recommendations for zafirlukast are not currently standard practice and would benefit from further clinical validation to clarify their relevance and necessity in clinical settings.
