## Drug Summary
Nitroglycerin, available under various brand names such as Deponit, Transderm-Nitro, and Nitrolingual Pump Spray, is an organic nitrate primarily used to manage angina pectoris and other heart-related conditions. Discovered in 1847 for industrial use, its medical application in treating angina was recognized in the late 19th century due to observed symptomatic relief in factory workers experiencing chest pain. Nitroglycerin operates as a vasodilator, promoting the relaxation of vascular smooth muscles thereby increasing blood flow to the myocardium and reducing cardiac preload and afterload. This results in decreased myocardial wall stress and amelioration of anginal symptoms. It has a rapid absorption profile which makes it suitable for acute management of angina attacks. Nitroglycerin is employed in various forms including sublingual tablets, transdermal patches, and intravenous infusions, each tailored to specific clinical situations ranging from acute angina relief to prophylaxis and management of peri-operative hypertension and congestive heart failure.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Nitroglycerin exerts its effects through metabolic conversion by mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) into nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator. Nitric oxide subsequently activates guanylate cyclase, which increases levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in vascular smooth muscle leading to vasodilation. Specifically, it has been identified to target the atrial natriuretic peptide receptor 1 (NPR1), enhancing its vasodilatory actions. Despite its notable efficacy, nitroglycerin's metabolism by ALDH2 is crucial as it also dictates the development of tolerance with prolonged use, where the vascular smooth muscle becomes desensitized to further nitroglycerin-induced vasorelaxation.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of nitroglycerin is significantly influenced by the activity of ALDH2, which is essential for its bioactivation to nitric oxide. Variants in the ALDH2 gene can alter enzyme activity, impacting the clinical efficacy and risk of tolerance to nitroglycerin. Individuals with inactive ALDH2 variants might experience reduced therapeutic effects from nitroglycerin, necessitating adjustments in dosage or alternative therapies. Furthermore, the genetic variability in the ALDH2 gene can influence the risk of developing tolerance, potentially requiring more frequent dosing intervals or the use of combination therapies to mitigate tolerance. Understanding these genetic factors is crucial in optimizing nitroglycerin therapy for individual patients, particularly in populations with a high prevalence of ALDH2 variants, such as East Asians.
