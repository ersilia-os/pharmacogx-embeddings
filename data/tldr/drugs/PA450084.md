## Drug Summary
Irbesartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) primarily used to manage hypertension and diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes patients displaying elevated serum creatinine and proteinuria. As an ARB, irbesartan specifically targets the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT<sub>1</sub>), inhibiting the typical angiotensin II effects such as vasoconstriction and aldosterone secretion, ultimately lowering blood pressure. Approved by the FDA in 1997, it offers advantages over angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, notably the absence of an associated dry cough. Irbesartan is known for its high bioavailability (60-80%), with maximal plasma concentrations achieved within 1.5–2 hours post-dosing, and it exhibits a prolonged half-life supporting once-daily dosing. Its metabolism predominantly involves glucuronidation and oxidation in the liver, facilitated by enzymes like CYP2C9.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Irbesartan primarily targets the AGTR1 (Type-1 angiotensin II receptor), preventing angiotensin II from inducing its cardiovascular effects. It binds with high affinity to AGTR1 and negligible affinity to the AT<sub>2</sub> receptor. It also has an interaction with JUN (transcription factor AP-1), suggesting potential broader biological effects. Liver enzymes metabolize irbesartan, including UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-3 (UGT1A3), CYP2C9, and to a lesser extent CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and PTGS1. The drug’s glucuronidation by UGT1A3 leads to the formation of the M8 metabolite, while hydroxylation by CYP2C9 produces several other metabolites (M4, M5, M7), which are further modified. In terms of carriers, irbesartan interacts with serum albumin (ALB) and alpha1-acid glycoprotein (ORM2), affecting its distribution and plasma binding.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of irbesartan primarily revolves around its metabolism mediated by CYP2C9 and UGT1A3. Variants in the CYP2C9 gene can influence the drug's pharmacokinetics by altering the rate of metabolism, potentially affecting both efficacy and toxicity profiles. For example, patients with reduced function alleles like CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 may exhibit slower metabolism, leading to higher plasma levels and prolonged drug action, which might necessitate dosage adjustments. UGT1A3 variants could also impact the glucuronidation efficiency, subsequently affecting the clearance of irbesartan. However, specific genetic polymorphisms’ impact on clinical outcomes requires further detailed studies to corroborate these interactions for tailored therapeutic strategies. The focus on such pharmacogenomic relationships could potentially enhance the personalized medical approach in treating hypertension with irbesartan based on individual genetic profiles.
