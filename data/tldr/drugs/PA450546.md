## Drug Summary
Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) approved by the US FDA in 1998, primarily utilized in the management of asthma and allergic rhinitis. It shows high efficacy in preventing asthma attacks by blocking the action of leukotrienes, substances in the body that can trigger asthma and allergic rhinitis symptoms. It is beneficial as both monotherapy and in combination with other agents such as inhaled corticosteroids and beta-agonists. Montelukast is also indicated for the prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) and for relieving symptoms of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis. Despite concerns over neuropsychiatric effects, montelukast remains widely used, available as a generic and under various brand names. Its pharmacokinetics reveal rapid oral absorption and extensive metabolism predominantly by the cytochrome P450 system.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Montelukast exerts its therapeutic effects primarily through high-affinity binding to the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CYSLTR1), which inhibits leukotriene (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) activities responsible for asthma and rhinitis symptoms. It additionally affects arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5), although this is not its primary mode of action. The drug is metabolized largely by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and CYP2C9. Montelukast's absorption and systemic bioavailability do not appear to be significantly influenced by food intake. Interestingly, the solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 2B1 (SLCO2B1) is also involved in its pharmacokinetics, potentially influencing its distribution or excretion.

## Pharmacogenetics
Montelukast pharmacogenetics focuses heavily on its metabolism involving cytochrome P450 enzymes, which could vary significantly between individuals due to genetic differences. Variants in genes such as **CYP2C8** and **CYP2C9** might affect drug levels and hence efficacy and safety profiles. While specific allelic variations affecting montelukast metabolism and response are not comprehensively documented, it is inferred that polymorphisms in these enzymes could lead to variable patient responses. Due to montelukast's link with neuropsychiatric effects, genetic factors influencing neurotransmitter pathways may also be relevant, though explicit gene-drug interactions in this area remain to be fully clarified. A deeper understanding of these genetic variables could lead to more tailored and effective asthma and allergic rhinitis management strategies using montelukast.
