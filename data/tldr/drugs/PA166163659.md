## Drug Summary
N-desmethylclozapine, also known as norclozapine, is the primary active metabolite of the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine. Although its parent drug, clozapine, is reserved primarily for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, norclozapine contributes to the overall pharmacological effects seen in patients on clozapine therapy. This metabolite has a similar but distinct pharmacological profile compared to clozapine, including binding to various neurotransmitter receptors. Norclozapine exhibits its antipsychotic effects through dopaminergic, serotonergic, adrenergic, and muscarinic receptors. Its metabolism is mainly hepatic, and it possesses some pharmacokinetic characteristics that differ from those of clozapine, potentially involving different metabolic pathways and enzymes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Although specific targets, enzymes, transporters, and carriers directly associated with norclozapine are not detailed within the provided DrugBank information, it is known from other sources that n-desmethylclozapine influences several neurotransmitter systems. Like clozapine, it likely interacts with dopamine D2, serotonin 5-HT2A, and various other receptor subtypes which contribute to its antipsychotic properties. The metabolic transformation from clozapine to norclozapine is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes, notably CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. The activity of these enzymes can influence the plasma levels and effect profile of norclozapine.

## Pharmacogenetics
In terms of pharmacogenetics, the metabolism of clozapine to norclozapine is significantly influenced by the genetic polymorphisms in the CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 genes. Variants in these genes can lead to differences in the metabolic rate and, consequently, the therapeutic efficacy and side-effect profile of norclozapine. Since norclozapine retains considerable pharmacological activity, genetic variations that affect its concentration indirectly impact clinical outcomes in patients treated with clozapine. Moreover, pharmacogenetic testing might help in personalizing clozapine therapy, optimizing dose adjustments to achieve effective norclozapine levels while minimizing adverse effects. Lower or higher activity variants in these genes might necessitate dosage alterations or closer monitoring. However, prospective studies directly linking norclozapine levels with specific genetic polymorphisms would enhance the understanding and clinical integration of such data.
