## Drug Summary
Sildenafil, marketed commonly under the brand name Viagra among others, is primarily known for its use in treating erectile dysfunction (ED) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). As a selective phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, sildenafil enhances the effects of nitric oxide (NO) released during sexual stimulation by inhibiting the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the corpus cavernosum. This action promotes blood flow into the penis resulting in an erection, while also benefiting patients with PAH by promoting vasodilation in the pulmonary vasculature. It has a relatively quick absorption rate and its bioavailability is influenced by food intake. The metabolism of sildenafil is primarily mediated by CYP3A4 with its major circulating metabolite possessing about half the potency of the parent drug with regards to PDE5 inhibition.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Sildenafil acts predominantly on the enzyme PDE5A found in the corpus cavernosum, enhancing the vasodilatory effects of NO by maintaining cGMP levels. It also has lesser affinity for PDE6, involved in the phototransduction pathway in the retina, which explains side effects related to color vision. Apart from PDE5A, its action on other phosphodiesterases like PDE6G and PDE6H is less significant clinically. The drug is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9, and is also known to interact with various transport proteins such as P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and SLCO1B1 which can affect its distribution and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
Sildenafil's effects can vary depending on the individual's genetic makeup. Variants in the ACE gene (rs1799752) and the GNB3 gene (rs5443) have been associated with a better erectile response in users treated with sildenafil. These pharmacogenetic implications suggest that individuals carrying certain genotypes may experience more profound therapeutic effects, underlining the importance of personalized medicine in optimizing treatment outcomes with sildenafil. Moreover, as metabolism of sildenafil is significantly mediated by CYP3A4, genetic variations affecting CYP3A4 activity might influence the drug's pharmacokinetics and thus its efficacy and safety profile, although specific allele-related effects need deeper clinical validation.
