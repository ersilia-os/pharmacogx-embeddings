## Drug Summary
Rabeprazole, also known by its brand name Pariet, is an antiulcer medication belonging to the class of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). It functions as a prodrug that transforms into its active sulphenamide form within the acidic environment of the gastric parietal cells. Rabeprazole is specifically designed to inhibit the H<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase enzyme, pivotal in the gastric acid secretion process. This results in a dose-dependent suppression of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion. Indications for rabeprazole include the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, eradication of H. pylori infections, and the prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with NSAID use. Rabeprazole’s absolute bioavailability is approximately 52%, with metabolism primarily occurring in the liver.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary target of rabeprazole is the ATP4A, or the potassium-transporting ATPase alpha chain 1, which plays a crucial role in gastric acid secretion by parietal cells. Rabeprazole binds to and inhibits this enzyme, effectively reducing acid secretion. Metabolism of rabeprazole involves various cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, CYP3A4, and significantly CYP2C19, which influences its breakdown and clearance. The drug’s interaction with transporters involves ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2), which could affect its absorption and distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
Rabeprazole's metabolism involves multiple cytochrome P450 isoenzymes with CYP2C19 playing a prominent role, making it subject to pharmacogenetic variability. Individuals with different CYP2C19 genotypes may exhibit variations in the metabolic rate of rabeprazole, affecting both efficacy and safety. Poor metabolizers with less active CYP2C19 might experience higher plasma levels of rabeprazole, potentially leading to enhanced therapeutic effects but also increased risk of adverse effects. Conversely, extensive metabolizers may have reduced drug levels and possible under-treatment. Pharmacogenetic testing can guide dosage adjustments and improve therapeutic outcomes, particularly in populations with a high prevalence of CYP2C19 polymorphisms.
