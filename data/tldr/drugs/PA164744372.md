## Drug Summary
Amikacin, sold under various brand names like Amukin, Biklin, and Selaxa, is a semi-synthetic aminoglycoside antibiotic derived from kanamycin A. It is primarily used to treat serious bacterial infections caused by susceptible strains of gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas species, Escherichia coli, and various others. Amikacin binds to the 30S ribosomal subunits of bacteria, disrupting protein synthesis, which is essential for bacterial growth. The drug is indicated for several infections including septicemia, respiratory, urinary, and intra-abdominal infections, as well as certain mycobacterial infections. Amikacin is administered via intravenous or intramuscular injections, and more recently, as a liposomal inhalation suspension for certain lung diseases. Despite its effectiveness, it must be used cautiously due to its potential nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Amikacin acts by binding specifically to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, particularly the rpsL gene product, which is the 30S ribosomal protein S12, causing misreading of mRNA. This interaction inhibits the proper translation and production of proteins that are vital for bacterial survival and replication. This mechanism is one of the key factors in its broad activity against aerobic gram-negative bacteria and some gram-positive ones. No specific human enzymes, transporters, or carriers that interact with amikacin are listed, emphasizing that its action is primarily extracellular and targets bacterial components.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of amikacin have not been extensively characterized in terms of patient genetic variability impacting drug response and toxicity. However, considering the class of aminoglycosides, it is known that genetic variants in mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (e.g., MT-RNR1) may influence susceptibility to ototoxicity, though specific studies or variant data for amikacin may not be detailed. Additionally, genetic variations that affect kidney function might indirectly influence amikacin's toxicity profile, given its nephrotoxic potential. Therefore, while direct pharmacogenetic data for amikacin are not extensively documented, inferences based on its pharmacological class suggest areas where genetics might play a role in individuating therapy risks and benefits.
