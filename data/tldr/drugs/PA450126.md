## Drug Summary
Isosorbide mononitrate, available under various brand names such as ISMO, Monoket, and Imdur, is an organic nitrate used primarily for the prevention and management of angina pectoris resulting from coronary artery disease. As a prodrug, its therapeutic effects are mediated through its metabolism into nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator. Isosorbide mononitrate facilitates the reduction of cardiac preload and afterload by dilating blood vessels, thus decreasing myocardial oxygen demand and improving blood flow to the ischemic heart muscle. The drug is characterized by a rapid and complete absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, achieving peak plasma concentrations within 30 to 60 minutes post-administration. It bypasses hepatic first-pass metabolism, resulting in nearly 100% bioavailability, with inactive metabolites including isosorbide, sorbitol, and mononitrate glucuronide.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary mechanism of action of isosorbide mononitrate involves its conversion to NO, which subsequently activates soluble guanylate cyclase, particularly the alpha-2 subunit (GUCY1A2). This activation enhances intracellular cGMP levels, leading to vascular smooth muscle relaxation. Pharmacodynamically, the drug also reduces the intracellular calcium concentrations, facilitating the relaxation of smooth muscle tissues beyond the vascular system, including esophageal and biliary muscles. The enzyme profile involved in its metabolism includes glutathione S-transferase Mu 1 (GSTM1), xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase (XDH), and alcohol dehydrogenase class-3 (ADH5). This metabolic process, however, does not involve meaningful interactions with major drug transporters or carriers, leading to straightforward pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
Isosorbide mononitrate's pharmacogenetics interactions primarily involve its metabolism by GSTM1, XDH, and ADH5. Genetic polymorphisms in these enzymes might influence the drug's pharmacokinetic profile and the individual's response to therapy. For instance, variants in GSTM1 might affect the detoxification capacity for the metabolites of isosorbide mononitrate, potentially impacting drug efficacy and safety. However, specific pharmacogenetic guidelines or recommendations for dose adjustments based on genetic variations are not yet well established in clinical practice for this drug. Further research is necessary to elucidate definitive impacts of genetic variations on the pharmacodynamics and effectiveness of isosorbide mononitrate in treating angina pectoris.
