## Drug Summary
Venlafaxine, also marketed under the name Elafax, is an antidepressant belonging to the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) class. It is utilized primarily for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), and panic disorder. Introduced in 1993 as Effexor and later as Effexor XR, an extended-release formulation, venlafaxine functions by increasing neurotransmitter levels in the synapse, specifically serotonin and norepinephrine, enhancing their mood-regulating effects. The drug demonstrates higher selectivity for serotonin reuptake inhibition at lower doses, with additional norepinephrine reuptake inhibition at higher doses. Venlafaxine is well absorbed orally, achieving peak concentrations within 2 to 9 hours, depending on the formulation. It undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver, primarily via the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6, to its active metabolite desvenlafaxine (ODV).

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Venlafaxineâ€™s primary mechanisms involve the inhibition of the sodium-dependent serotonin transporter (SLC6A4), noradrenaline transporter (SLC6A2), and to a lesser extent, the dopamine transporter (SLC6A3). This blockade increases the synaptic levels of these neurotransmitters. Metabolically, venlafaxine is extensively processed in the liver predominantly by CYP2D6, and also by CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP2C9. The formed metabolite, ODV, is further metabolized, leading to various secondary metabolites. Additionally, venlafaxine and its metabolites interact with transporters like P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1) and ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2), which may influence both the distribution and elimination of the drug.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of venlafaxine is significantly influenced by variations in the CYP2D6 gene. Certain polymorphisms in CYP2D6 (e.g., rs3892097, rs5030655) result in reduced enzymatic activity leading to decreased metabolism of venlafaxine. This can affect both drug efficacy and the risk of adverse effects. Patients with these genotypes may accumulate higher levels of venlafaxine and may require dose adjustments. Moreover, polymorphisms in the ABCB1 gene, such as rs2032583, have been associated with differential responses to venlafaxine. Those with specific variants of this gene are more likely to achieve remission from major depressive disorder when treated with venlafaxine and might also have an increased risk of adverse events. This highlights the importance of considering genetic makeup when prescribing venlafaxine to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize risks.
