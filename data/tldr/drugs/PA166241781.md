## Drug Summary
Isepamicin, a semisynthetic aminoglycoside antibiotic derived from gentamicin, is used primarily for treating infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. It closely resembles other aminoglycosides in terms of its bactericidal activity, working by binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, interfering with protein synthesis and thus inhibiting bacterial growth. The pharmacokinetics of isepamicin allows it to remain active longer than some other aminoglycosides, providing a dosing advantage. The information regarding its absorption, metabolism, and other pharmacokinetic details are not specified in the provided DrugBank data.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The specific molecular targets, as well as the enzymes, transporters, and carriers associated with isepamicin, are not detailed in the provided DrugBank information. However, like other aminoglycosides, its main action is typically against the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, causing inhibition of protein synthesis. No human enzymes, transporters, or carriers are typically implicated in the action or disposition of isepamicin based on general knowledge of the aminoglycoside class.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of isepamicin is not well-established or documented in the provided DrugBank data or widely in the literature. Although aminoglycosides, as a group, have some pharmacogenetic considerations—such as genetic variations influencing ototoxicity or nephrotoxicity—the specific genomic associations for isepamicin have not been robustly described. This lack of detailed genomic data limits the ability to predict patient-specific responses or risks based on genetic factors for this particular antibiotic. Future studies could potentially reveal relevant pharmacogenetic markers that impact the efficacy or safety of isepamicin.
