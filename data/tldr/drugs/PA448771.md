## Drug Summary
Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent primarily used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. It belongs to the class of antimetabolites and acts as a prodrug, which is enzymatically converted to its active form, fluorouracil (5-FU), within the tumor cells. This conversion preferentially occurs in tumor tissues due to the higher concentration of converting enzymes present in these cells compared to normal tissues. Capecitabine is intended for various types of cancer treatments, often as part of a combination therapy, and its action involves interfering with DNA synthesis, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. It is crucial to note that the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and its metabolites show variable absorption and conversion rates, which can significantly affect its efficacy and toxicity.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Capecitabine targets Thymidylate Synthase (TYMS), a critical enzyme in DNA synthesis, thus exerting its anticancer effects. The drug metabolization pathway begins with its conversion by carboxylesterase (CES1) to 5’-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine (5’-DFCR), followed by transformation to 5’-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5’-DFUR) by cytidine deaminase (CDA). Thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP) further converts 5’-DFUR to the active fluorouracil. Additional enzymes such as Uridine Phosphorylase 1 and 2 (UPP1, UPP2) and CYP2C9 are involved in the drug's metabolic pathways leading to various metabolites that contribute to the drug’s mechanism of action. The drug also interacts with carriers like Serum Albumin (ALB), which can impact its bioavailability and distribution within the body.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors significantly influence capecitabine’s metabolism and the patient's response to treatment. Notably, variations in the DPYD gene, which encodes dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) involved in fluorouracil metabolism, are critical. Several SNPs in DPYD, such as rs3918290, rs55886062, rs67376798, and others, are associated with increased toxicity risk. These genetic variants can lead to reduced DPD activity, resulting in higher levels of active fluorouracil, thus increasing the risk of severe side effects. Assessment of DPYD genotype before initiating capecitabine therapy can help identify patients at risk of toxicity, allowing for dosage adjustments or alternative treatments to enhance safety and therapeutic efficacy.
