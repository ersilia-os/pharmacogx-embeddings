## Drug Summary
Noroxycodone is a major metabolite of the opioid drug oxycodone. Oxycodone is widely used for the management of moderate to severe pain and operates primarily through its action on the opioid receptors in the brain and body. Noroxycodone maintains some of this pharmacological activity but is generally considered less potent than its parent compound. The drug exhibits typical opioid pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, characterized by its absorption, distribution, metabolism (primarily in the liver), and excretion profile.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
As a metabolite of oxycodone, noroxycodone interacts with the opioid receptors but with a lower affinity compared to oxycodone. These receptors include mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors which mediate the drug's analgesic effects. The enzymes involved in the metabolism of oxycodone to form noroxycodone primarily include CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP2D6. Noroxycodone might also be subject to further metabolism and elimination processes which involve various transporters and carriers, but specific interactions are less well-documented compared to oxycodone.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of noroxycodone are largely derived from studies on oxycodone, given it is a direct metabolite. The metabolism of oxycodone into noroxycodone is significantly influenced by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes. Variations in the genes encoding these enzymes, such as polymorphisms in CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, can affect the rate of metabolism and consequently the levels and effects of noroxycodone. For instance, individuals with certain CYP2D6 variant alleles that result in reduced enzyme activity may experience different pharmacokinetic profiles and possibly altered pain management outcomes. However, specific pharmacogenetic interactions directly involving noroxycodone have not been as extensively studied or documented compared to the parent drug, oxycodone.
