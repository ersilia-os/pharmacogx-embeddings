## Drug Summary
Odevixibat, also known by its brand name Bylvay, is an ileal sodium/bile acid cotransporter inhibitor (IBAT inhibitor), specifically indicated for the treatment of pruritus in patients with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC), a group of autosomal recessive liver disorders that lead to liver damage and may necessitate liver transplantation. Odevixibat received FDA approval on July 20, 2021, and Health Canada approval on November 13, 2023. It represents a significant non-surgical treatment option for PFIC, offering an alternative to previous therapies like ursodeoxycholic acid. The drug is administered orally with a moderate duration of action, requiring once-daily dosing. Its pharmacokinetic profile shows low systemic absorption with minimal detectable plasma concentrations in both adults and children.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Odevixibat acts by inhibiting the ileal sodium/bile acid cotransporter (SLC10A2), which is primarily responsible for the reabsorption of bile acids from the ileum. By inhibiting this transporter, odevixibat decreases bile acid reabsorption, which in turn reduces liver bile acid concentrations and potentially alleviates pruritus associated with PFIC. Interestingly, the drug is also a substrate for the transporter protein P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), which could influence its distribution and excretion. The drug demonstrates little metabolism, with only minor amounts undergoing mono-hydroxylation, and no significant metabolites have been found at high concentrations. 

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of odevixibat may include considerations related to its interaction with the transporter protein ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), which could affect drug disposition in patients with variations in this transporter gene. Patients with PFIC type 2 who have variants in the ABCB11 gene leading to non-functional bile salt export pumps may not respond effectively to odevixibat, indicating a genotype-specific influence on treatment efficacy. While comprehensive genomic data directly related to odevixibat is currently unavailable, the drugâ€™s interaction with specific transport proteins suggests a potential area for pharmacogenetic research, particularly in optimizing dosing and anticipating responses based on genetic variability in transporters like ABCB1.
