## Drug Summary
Sulfapyridine is an antibacterial sulfonamide antibiotic, previously used for the treatment of dermatitis herpetiformis, benign mucous membrane pemphigoid, and pyoderma gangrenosum. This drug operates by inhibiting bacterial enzyme systems involved in folic acid synthesis, crucial for bacterial cell division and growth. Sulfapyridine has a bacteriostatic action against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. However, it has fallen out of regular prescription due to potential toxicity and the development of bacterial resistance. It has approximately 60-80% absorption when administered orally and is metabolized primarily in the liver. Its pharmacodynamics involve competitive inhibition of p-aminobenzoic acid, which is essential in the bacterial folic acid metabolism, thus preventing the synthesis of necessary nucleic acids.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Sulfapyridine specifically targets and inhibits the bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthase type-1 (sulI), predominantly found in Mycobacterium fortuitum. This inhibition blocks the synthesis of folic acid by processing the substrate para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), essential for bacterial growth and replication. In terms of metabolism, Sulfapyridine is primarily metabolized by Cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) in humans. Being hepatically metabolized, this enzyme's activity significantly impacts the drug's pharmacokinetic profile. The drug data does not list any specific transporters or carriers associated with Sulfapyridine, indicating its interaction within the body might be limited to metabolism and direct antibacterial action.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of Sulfapyridine are influenced primarily by its metabolism through the enzyme CYP2C9. Variability in CYP2C9 activity, due to genetic polymorphisms in the CYP2C9 gene, can significantly affect the drug's pharmacokinetics and, potentially, its efficacy and toxicity. For instance, individuals with reduced function alleles of CYP2C9 may experience slower metabolism of Sulfapyridine, leading to prolonged exposure and increased risk of adverse effects. This is a key consideration in personalized medicine when prescribing Sulfapyridine, although its clinical use has decreased significantly. The genomic data specifically impacting Sulfapyridine were not provided, but general CYP2C9 pharmacogenetics can be extrapolated to infer likely interactions.
