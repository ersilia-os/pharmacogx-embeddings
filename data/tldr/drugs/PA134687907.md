## Drug Summary
Formoterol, also known by brand names such as Foradil and Oxis Turbuhaler, is an inhaled beta-2 adrenergic agonist utilized primarily in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Approved in the United States in 2001, formoterol distinguishes itself by both a rapid onset of action, approximately 2-3 minutes after administration, and a prolonged duration of effect, lasting up to 12 hours. This dual benefit facilitates its recommendation for both immediate relief and maintenance treatment of bronchial conditions. In terms of formulation, formoterol is available as a single-agent inhaler and in combination with corticosteroids like budesonide and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) such as aclidinium and glycopyrronium, enhancing its utility in step-up therapy for more severe cases. Its pharmacokinetic properties include a pulmonary bioavailability of about 43% and a systemic bioavailability of approximately 60%, with metabolism predominantly via direct glucuronidation and O-demethylation.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Formoterol acts primarily through stimulating beta-2 adrenergic receptors (ADRB2), enhancing bronchodilation. Though it exhibits greater selectivity for these receptors, minor interactions occur with beta-1 (ADRB1) and beta-3 (ADRB3) adrenergic receptors, which slightly influences cardiac tissues and other non-pulmonary systems. It undergoes metabolism chiefly by glucuronidation and O-demethylation through several cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2A6) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT1A1, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, UGT2B7, UGT2B15). Additionally, formoterol interacts with various solute carrier family members (SLC22A1, SLC22A3, SLC22A4, SLC22A5) which may affect its disposition in cells, and the protein serum albumin (ALB) acts as a carrier, potentially influencing its bioavailability and distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
From a pharmacogenetic perspective, formoterol metabolism and response variability can be influenced by genetic variations in enzymes like CYP2D6 and the UGT family members, which dictate the rate of drug metabolism and might affect drug levels and side effects. Specifically, polymorphisms in these enzymes could lead to altered drug efficacy or increased risk of adverse effects, such as exaggerated beta-adrenergic responses including tachycardia or arrhythmias. While these inferred pharmacogenetic interactions highlight the importance of genetic factors in individual responses to formoterol, further clinical data and research are needed to fully utilize these insights in a personalized medicine approach, particularly regarding dosage adjustments or risk management in specific populations.
