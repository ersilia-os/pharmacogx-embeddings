## Drug Summary
Umeclidinium is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), also known as an anticholinergic drug, predominantly used in the maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Approved by the FDA in April 2014 under the brand name Incruse Ellipta and additionally as part of combination products, it alleviates symptoms like shortness of breath and cough by blocking the M3 muscarinic receptor to prevent bronchoconstriction. Umeclidinium exhibits a rapid onset of action with peak plasma levels occurring within 5-15 minutes post-inhalation. Its effects are extended, reaching steady state within 14 days. The bioavailability of inhaled umeclidinium is roughly 13%, with minimal oral absorption, indicating that its effects are primarily localized to the airway surface.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Umeclidinium targets several subtypes of muscarinic receptors, including M1 (CHRM1), M2 (CHRM2), M3 (CHRM3), M4 (CHRM4), and M5 (CHRM5), with its pharmacological action being mainly through the inhibition of M3 receptors which are pivotal in mediating bronchoconstrictive responses. It is metabolized predominantly by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), highlighting the specific breakdown pathway in which the drug undergoes oxidative and conjugative processes. Umeclidinium is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1) and the organic cation transporters SLC22A1 and SLC22A2, illustrating its complex interaction with bodyâ€™s transport systems. Additionally, it interacts with major plasma protein carriers such as serum albumin (ALB) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (ORM1), which may influence its distribution and pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of umeclidinium involves primarily its metabolism by CYP2D6, an enzyme known for its genetic polymorphism which can significantly affect the metabolism of drugs. Individuals with various CYP2D6 genotypes may exhibit different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, leading to variance in therapeutic outcomes or adverse effects. For instance, poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 could potentially experience increased exposure to umeclidinium, elevating the risk of side effects, although clinical relevance is yet to be fully established. No specific pharmacogenetic guidelines have been issued for umeclidinium based on CYP2D6 polymorphisms, but it remains an area of interest for personalized medicine approaches in the treatment of respiratory conditions.
