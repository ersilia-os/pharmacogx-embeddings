## Drug Summary
Oxaliplatin, marketed under the brand name Eloxatin®, is a platinum-based antineoplastic agent primarily used in combination with infusional fluorouracil and leucovorin for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer and adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer after complete resection of the primary tumor. It belongs to the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin but contains a diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group, enhancing its antitumor effects and altering its cytotoxic mechanisms compared to its relatives. The drug undergoes rapid non-enzymatic biotransformation, complicating its pharmacokinetics. Oxaliplatin shows in vivo antitumor activities and, alongside fluorouracil, exhibits significant antiproliferative efficacy against various tumor types. The platinum in oxaliplatin forms DNA crosslinks (both interstrand and intrastrand) that inhibit DNA replication and transcription, contributing to its cytotoxic effects.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
While explicit target information for Oxaliplatin is not provided, its cytotoxic effects are known to arise from the formation of DNA crosslinks. Oxaliplatin interacts with several enzymes including Glutathione S-transferase theta-1 (GSTT1), Metallothionein-1A (MT1A), Metallothionein-2 (MT2A), Myeloperoxidase (MPO), Superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn] (SOD1), Glutathione S-transferase P (GSTP1), Glutathione S-transferase Mu 1 (GSTM1), and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase [quinone] 1 (NQO1). In terms of transporters, it is associated with Solute carrier family 22 member 2 (SLC22A2), High affinity copper uptake protein 1 (SLC31A1), Solute carrier family 22 member 3 (SLC22A3), ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2), Canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter 1 (ABCC2), Copper-transporting ATPase 2 (ATP7B), and Copper-transporting ATPase 1 (ATP7A). Albumin (ALB) acts as a carrier protein for oxaliplatin in plasma.

## Pharmacogenetics
Oxaliplatin's efficacy and toxicity are influenced by genetic polymorphisms, particularly in the genes encoding for its metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Variants in GSTP1, GSTM1, and GSTT1, which code for glutathione S-transferases involved in detoxification, may alter the drug’s effectiveness and the patient's side effect profile. NQO1 polymorphisms could influence the detoxification of reactive oxaliplatin metabolites, affecting toxicity. Variations in the transporter genes like ABCG2 and ABCC2 have been associated with altered drug efflux, potentially impacting drug resistance and systemic exposure. Understanding these genetic interactions could be crucial for optimizing therapeutic regimens and minimizing adverse effects, making pharmacogenetic testing a valuable tool for personalized medicine approaches in cancer chemotherapy involving oxaliplatin.
