## Drug Summary
Aminosalicylic acid, also known as Pamisyl, Rexipas, and Rezipas (DrugBank ID: DB00233), is an antitubercular agent primarily used in the treatment of tuberculosis. This agent is often administered in conjunction with isoniazid and functions as a bacteriostatic drug against *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. Aminosalicylic acid inhibits the bacterium's ability to multiply by disrupting folic acid synthesis and the formation of mycobactin, which is essential for bacterial iron uptake. This drug has a relatively short serum half-life of approximately one hour and is metabolized in the liver. The sodium salt form is generally better tolerated than the free acid form.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Aminosalicylic acid works through the inhibition of folic acid synthesis by binding more effectively to pteridine synthetase than para-aminobenzoic acid, a precursor in folic acid synthesis pathway. Among its molecular targets are PTGS2 (Prostaglandin G/H synthase 2), CHUK (Inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit alpha), ALOX5 (Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase), and PLA2G2E (Group IIE secretory phospholipase A2). These interactions suggest a mechanism involving the interruption of inflammatory processes, although their direct relevance to the drug's antitubercular action could be limited. Additionally, aminosalicylic acid is metabolized by the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO). There is no specific information provided about transporters or carriers.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there is no detailed pharmacogenetic data provided for aminosalicylic acid in the DrugBank entry. However, variations in the MPO gene, which metabolizes the drug, may influence the drug's efficacy and safety profile, though detailed studies or clinical correlates need to be examined to substantiate this hypothesis. Generally, for drugs undergoing hepatic metabolism such as aminosalicylic acid, genetic polymorphisms in liver enzymes might significantly affect drug levels and treatment outcomes. Monitoring and further research into the genetic factors affecting the metabolism and action of aminosalicylic acid could be beneficial in optimizing treatment regimens for tuberculosis, especially in reducing toxicity and preventing resistance.
