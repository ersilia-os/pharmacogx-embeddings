## Drug Summary
Cidofovir is an injectable antiviral medication primarily used in the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Classified as a nucleotide analogue, it exerts its antiviral effects by selectively inhibiting viral DNA synthesis, making it particularly effective against CMV in HIV-positive patients. Cidofovir was first approved by the FDA in 1996 but was later discontinued. Its pharmacodynamics involve suppression of CMV replication through selective inhibition of viral DNA polymerase. The drug is notable for its ability to reach full absorption upon administration, although specifics about its metabolism are not well documented. The primary concerns regarding its use include potential nephrotoxicity and hematologic effects, such as leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Cidofovir targets the viral DNA polymerase catalytic subunit (UL54) in HHV-5 (human cytomegalovirus), which plays a crucial role in the replication of viral DNA. Its active metabolite, cidofovir diphosphate, selectively inhibits this enzyme, thus disrupting viral DNA synthesis at much lower concentrations than those required to affect human DNA polymerases (alpha, beta, and gamma). Additionally, the drug is processed by human thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP), an enzyme involved in the pyrimidine nucleoside degradation pathway, which might play a role in drug activation or degradation. Cidofovir is also transported by the solute carrier family 22 member 6 (SLC22A6), which can influence its pharmacokinetics by affecting renal clearance.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there is limited specific pharmacogenetic data directly linked to cidofovir. However, considering its metabolism and transport mechanisms, genes like TYMP and SLC22A6 could potentially influence its pharmacokinetics and toxicity profile. Variations in TYMP could affect the activation or breakdown of cidofovir, potentially altering its efficacy and safety. Additionally, genetic variations in SLC22A6, which is known to mediate the renal uptake of organic anions, could affect the drug's renal clearance, thereby impacting its nephrotoxic potential. More research would be beneficial to fully understand these pharmacogenetic interactions and to inform potential personalized dosing strategies to minimize toxicity while maximizing therapeutic efficacy.
