## Drug Summary
Ondansetron, marketed under names such as Zophren, is a well-established antiemetic medication primarily used to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. It functions as a competitive serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist. Introduced in the 1980s and FDA-approved since January 1991, ondansetron is available in various forms, including oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets (ODT), injections, and orally soluble films. The drug is known for its effectiveness in controlling nausea induced by emetogenic chemotherapy, especially high doses of cisplatin. Ondansetron's absorption is about 56% to 60% after oral administration with lesser bioavailability due to first-pass metabolism; hence, it requires careful dosing to avoid excessive QT prolongation, which led to the restriction of its 32 mg IV dose.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Ondansetron acts primarily by inhibiting the serotonin 5-HT3 receptors, which are implicated in the initiation of the vomiting reflex through both peripheral (gastrointestinal tract) and central (chemoreceptor trigger zone in the brain) pathways. Pharmacologically, ondansetron shows high specificity for these receptors while exerting minimal effects on other serotonin receptors or dopamine receptors. The metabolism of ondansetron involves several cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly CYP3A4, with contributions from CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and others including CYP2D9, CYP2E1, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7. This extensive involvement of multiple metabolic pathways aids in the drug's breakdown and excretion, primarily via the liver and subsequently excreted in urine and feces as various metabolites.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of ondansetron reveals significant interactions, particularly revolving around the CYP2D6 enzyme. Variability in CYP2D6 activity due to genetic differences can affect the metabolism of ondansetron. Patients with certain CYP2D6 genotypes who are ultrarapid metabolizers may experience suboptimal therapeutic responses to ondansetron due to faster metabolism, leading to potentially inadequate drug levels to exert its antiemetic effect, thereby increasing the risk of vomiting. This genotype effect underscores the importance of considering individual genetic profiles when prescribing ondansetron for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting to optimize both efficacy and safety.
