## Drug Summary
Escitalopram, known under brand names such as Cipralex and Esertia, is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) primarily indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). As the S-enantiomer of citalopram, it offers high potency and selectivity for the serotonin transporter (SERT), responsible for its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. Escitalopram also exhibits a faster onset of action and heightened efficacy, which is partly attributed to its unique allosteric modulation of SERT, augmenting its serotonergic activity. Metabolism occurs via hepatic enzymes with CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 playing significant roles. The pharmacokinetics of escitalopram include an oral bioavailability of approximately 80%, with peak plasma concentrations occurring around 4-5 hours post-dose.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Escitalopram acts by binding to the primary and allosteric sites of the serotonin transporter (SERT), enhancing extracellular serotonin levels. Minor activity at receptors such as CHRM1, HRH1, HTR1A, and various adrenergic receptors (e.g., ADRA1A, ADRA1B, ADRA1D, ADRA2A, ADRA2B, ADRA2C) explains some of its off-target effects. Metabolism involves CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and prominently CYP2C19, along with monoamine oxidases MAOA and MAOB, and aldehyde oxidase (AOX1). ABCB1, a key transporter, also plays a role in the disposition of escitalopram, influencing its pharmacokinetic properties. There are no specific carriers noted for this drug.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic differences significantly affect the metabolism and efficacy of escitalopram. Polymorphisms in the CYP2C19 gene, such as rs4244285 and rs4986893, are associated with poor metabolism of escitalopram, potentially necessitating dose adjustments to achieve therapeutic effects while avoiding toxicity. Additionally, genetic variants in the SLC6A4 gene, particularly rs25531, may influence the risk of adverse events, affecting the drugâ€™s safety profile for certain individuals. Understanding these genetic interactions can guide personalized medicine approaches, optimizing treatment outcomes through tailored dosage and patient monitoring strategies.
