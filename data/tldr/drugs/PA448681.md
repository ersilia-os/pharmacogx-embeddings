## Drug Summary
Budesonide is a widely used glucocorticoid which exerts its therapeutic effects by reducing inflammation and modulating the immune response. Marketed under various brand names like Pulmicort, Rhinosol, and Spirocort, it is used mainly for the treatment of respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders including asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Crohnâ€™s disease, and ulcerative colitis. Budesonide functions by decreasing capillary permeability, reducing leukocyte migration, and inhibiting inflammatory mediators. It was first approved by the FDA in 1994 and often comes in formulations combined with other drugs such as formoterol. It exhibits varying pharmacokinetics like low oral bioavailability due to high first-pass metabolism, with inhalational routes showing better systemic availability.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Budesonide acts primarily through the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), modifying gene expressions to exert anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive actions. Annexin A1 (ANXA1) is another target that mediates some anti-inflammatory processes. Budesonide is metabolized predominantly by the cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent CYP3A5 and CYP3A7, alongside various other CYP enzymes. Notable transporters involved with budesonide include the P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and the bile salt export pump (ABCB11), which may influence its disposition. The main carriers for budesonide are SERPINA6, which binds corticosteroids, and serum albumin (ALB).

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors play a significant role in the variability of responses to budesonide among individuals, particularly in asthma treatment. The presence of certain polymorphisms in the gene TBX21, as per the genomic data from DrugBank (rs2240017), has been suggested to correlate with enhanced responsiveness to budesonide in asthma management. Moreover, variations in the cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, can significantly alter the metabolism of budesonide, influencing both efficacy and side-effect profiles across different patients. This individual variation underscores the importance of personalized medicine approaches in optimizing budesonide therapy, especially in disorders with complex inflammatory pathways like asthma and inflammatory bowel diseases.
