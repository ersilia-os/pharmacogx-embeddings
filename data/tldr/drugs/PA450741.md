## Drug Summary
Oxycodone, marketed under various names including Oxanest and OxyIR, is a semisynthetic opioid analgesic derived initially from thebaine in 1917. It has been used medically since 1950 when the FDA approved Percodan, an oxycodone-containing product. Oxycodone is indicated for moderate to severe pain management in an immediate-release format and for chronic pain in an extended-release version. It demonstrates a high oral bioavailability between 60% to 87%, and food does not affect its absorption. Oxycodone primarily undergoes hepatic metabolism involving CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2D6 enzymes leading to various metabolites, including noroxycodone and oxymorphone.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Oxycodone acts through opioid receptors, specifically the mu (OPRM1), kappa (OPRK1), and delta (OPRD1) opioid receptors, triggering analgesic effects by initiating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways which inhibit N-type voltage-gated calcium channels, modulating pain response. Major enzymes involved in its metabolism include CYP2D6, which performs O-demethylation to produce oxymorphone, and CYP3A4/CYP3A5, which perform N-demethylation to produce noroxycodone. Additionally, oxycodone and its metabolites are carried by serum albumin (ALB) and alpha1-acid glycoprotein (ORM2), enhancing their systemic circulation and stability.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic variations, particularly in the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 genes, significantly influence oxycodone metabolism and consequently its efficacy and safety profile. CYP2D6 polymorphisms can lead to varying metabolic rates where poor metabolizers may experience reduced efficacy of oxycodone due to diminished conversion to the more active metabolite oxymorphone, while ultra-rapid metabolizers might have increased effects and possibly an elevated risk of toxicity due to faster and more extensive metabolism. Variants in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 can also affect the clearance rate of oxycodone and its metabolites, potentially altering the drug's effectiveness and risk profile. Therefore, understanding these genetic variations could be beneficial in customizing pain management therapies with oxycodone to improve therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects.
