## Drug Summary
Neomycin, sold under various brand names including Myacyne, Mycifradin, Myciguent, Neo-Rx, Neobiotic, and Nivemycin, is a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic. It is derived from the bacterium *Streptomyces fradiae*. Neomycin complex consists of three components: neomycin A (neamine), neomycin B (framycetin), and neomycin C, where the latter two stereoisomers are the key active pharmacological agents. Neomycin functions by binding to bacterial ribosomes and inhibiting protein synthesis, crucial for bacterial survival. It is effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including *E. coli*. Neomycin sulfate, the most common pharmaceutical form, is used primarily in adjunct therapy for hepatic coma and as a component in topical or ophthalmic products for treating bacterial infections.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Neomycin primarily targets the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria, specifically binding to the protein called rpsL (30S ribosomal protein S12) in *E. coli*. This interaction disrupts the initiation and elongation steps of bacterial protein synthesis, leading to bactericidal effects. Another target of neomycin is the CASR (Extracellular calcium-sensing receptor) in humans, which may reflect secondary pharmacological interactions. There are no specific enzymes, transporters, or carriers associated with neomycin reported in the provided data. The absorption of neomycin is minimal when taken orally, as it is poorly absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, leading to predominantly local gastrointestinal effects when used for hepatic coma.

## Pharmacogenetics
There are no specific pharmacogenetic data provided for neomycin, suggesting limited exploration of genetic interactions or variations influencing response to this drug. However, traditional pharmacogenetic concerns with aminoglycosides, like neomycin, often include ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, potentially linked to genetic variations in genes encoding for mitochondrial ribosomal proteins via a mechanism of mitochondrial toxicity. Although no specific genes have been definitively linked to neomycin-induced toxicity in humans, variations in genes such as MT-RNR1 (which encodes a mitochondrial ribosomal RNA linked to aminoglycoside-induced deafness) could hypothetically predispose individuals to adverse effects. Further research would be required to delineate any specific pharmacogenetic interactions for neomycin.
