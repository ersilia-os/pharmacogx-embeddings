## Drug Summary
Ceftriaxone, commercially known as Acantex, Biotrakson, and Rocephine, is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic notable for its broad-spectrum activity. It is particularly effective against a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria and exhibits a longer half-life compared to earlier generations of cephalosporins. Ceftriaxone achieves high penetration into the meninges, eyes, and inner ear, making it suitable for treating infections in these areas. It is commonly used to manage infections such as respiratory, skin, soft tissue, urinary tract, and ear, nose, and throat (ENT) infections caused by susceptible organisms. Despite its broad activity, ceftriaxone has reduced efficacy against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. It is usually administered via intravenous or intramuscular injections as it has negligible oral bioavailability.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Ceftriaxone exerts its bactericidal effects by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which are essential for bacterial cell wall synthesis. Specifically, it targets penA (Penicillin-binding protein 2B) in Streptococcus pneumoniae, leading to defective cell walls and bacterial death. Ceftriaxone’s activity involves several transporters such as SLC22A11, SLC22A6, SLC22A8, SLC15A1, and SLC15A2, which may play roles in the drug’s distribution and excretion. Additionally, it interacts with ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1) potentially affecting its efflux from cells. The drug is metabolized minimally in humans, with enzymes such as GLUL (Glutamine synthetase) being identified, though its role in drug metabolism is not clearly defined. Serum albumin (ALB) acts as a carrier, possibly influencing its pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of ceftriaxone has not been extensively characterized in the literature. However, given the involvement of transporters such as SLC22A6 (OAT1), SLC22A8 (OAT3), SLC22A11 (OAT4), SLC15A1 (PEPT1), and SLC15A2 (PEPT2) in its pharmacokinetics, genetic variants in these genes could potentially influence the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the drug. For example, polymorphisms in SLC22A6 and SLC22A8 have been associated with altered transporter function, which might affect ceftriaxone levels and its efficacy or toxicity. However, direct clinical correlations and recommendations for genetic testing prior to ceftriaxone use are currently lacking and warrant further investigation.
