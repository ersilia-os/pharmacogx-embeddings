## Drug Summary
Neratinib, marketed under the tradename Nerlynx, is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved by the FDA in July 2017. It is primarily used as extended adjuvant therapy for adult patients with early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer following adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy. Neratinib exerts its therapeutic effects by irreversibly binding to and inhibiting the activity of several receptor tyrosine kinases, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), HER2, and HER4. These kinases are involved in the signaling pathways that lead to cell growth and proliferation. The inhibition of these receptors is crucial in reducing oncogenic signaling pathways such as those mediated via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT pathways. Neratinib is known to have significant interactions with food and gastric pH, where its absorption can be greatly enhanced by food and reduced by gastric acid-reducing agents.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Neratinib's antitumor activity targets primarily include EGFR, HER2, and HER4, which are critical in various signaling pathways for cell proliferation and survival. Its metabolism is predominantly mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) with minor contributions from flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). The drug’s pharmacokinetics are influenced by transporters such as P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), which can affect the drug's distribution and excretion. In terms of carriers, neratinib interacts with serum albumin (ALB) and alpha1-acid glycoprotein (ORM2), which can influence its solubility and distribution within the body.

## Pharmacogenetics
In the context of pharmacogenetics, the metabolism of neratinib by CYP3A4 is particularly notable. Genetic variations in the CYP3A4 gene can lead to different metabolic rates among patients, affecting the drug’s efficacy and toxicity. Individuals with polymorphisms that result in reduced CYP3A4 activity might experience increased exposure to neratinib, potentially leading to heightened side effects or toxicity. Similarly, polymorphisms or expression changes in ABCB1 could alter the pharmacokinetics of neratinib, affecting drug absorption and disposition. Currently, specific actionable pharmacogenetic markers for neratinib are not explicitly highlighted in prescribing information, but genetic testing for CYP3A4 and ABCB1 genotypes may be considered in the context of personalized medicine to optimize therapy and manage side effects, particularly severe diarrhea and hepatotoxicity that are associated with this drug.
