## Drug Summary
Lovastatin, marketed under brand names such as Altocor and Mevacor, is a lipid-lowering agent belonging to the statin class. It is derived synthetically from a fermentation product of _Aspergillus terreus_. Lovastatin functions primarily by competitively inhibiting the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in the liver. This enzyme catalyzes early steps in the biosynthesis of cholesterol, specifically the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate. By inhibiting this pathway, lovastatin effectively reduces the internal production of cholesterol, which in turn lowers plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglycerides while increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL). The drug is indicated for the prevention of cardiovascular disease by reducing cholesterol levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia and is part of a broader treatment strategy involving a diet restrictive of fat and cholesterol.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Lovastatin primarily targets HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), which is key in cholesterol synthesis. Other reported targets include Integrin alpha-L (ITGAL) and Histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), which suggests broader implications in immune response and epigenetic regulation, respectively. Lovastatin is metabolized by the Cytochrome P450 system, predominantly by CYP3A4, with significant involvement from CYP2C8, and CYP2C19, among others. It also interacts with serum paraoxonase (PON3), which plays a role in drug activation. The drug's uptake in the liver is facilitated by OATP1B1, a critical hepatic transporter, with additional transport mediated by SLCO1B3 and other members of the solute carrier (SLCO) family. Excretion pathways involve transporters like p-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and bile salt export pump (ABCB11). Lovastatin is also carried in the blood bound largely to albumin (ALB).

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors significantly affect lovastatin's efficacy and safety. Genetic variations in OATP1B1, particularly the c.521T>C SNP (encoded by the SLCO1B1 gene), substantially influence the pharmacokinetics of lovastatin, with homozygous carriers of the 521CC genotype experiencing higher drug exposure, which correlates with an increased risk of myopathy. These findings are crucial for dosage adjustment and monitoring for adverse effects such as rhabdomyolysis, especially in patients predisposed genetically. Moreover, variants in the genes encoding metabolizing enzymes like CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 may alter the metabolic rate of lovastatin, potentially affecting both therapeutic efficacy and the occurrence of side effects. There is ongoing interest in understanding more about how these genetic variants can guide personalized dosing schedules to optimize therapy while minimizing the risk of adverse effects.
