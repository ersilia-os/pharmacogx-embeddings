## Drug Summary
Regorafenib, known by its DrugBank identifier DB08896, is a multi-kinase inhibitor used orally for treating various cancers, including metastatic colorectal cancer, advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). FDA approved since September 2012, its indications were expanded in April 2017 to include HCC previously treated with sorafenib. Regorafenib works by inhibiting several kinases related to cancer progression, angiogenesis, and tumor environment maintenance. Pharmacokinetically, it shows a maximum concentration (Cmax) of 2.5 µg/mL at about 4 hours after administration, with steady-state conditions increasing this to 3.9 µg/mL. Common adverse effects include fatigue, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR), diarrhea, hypertension, and decreased appetite.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Regorafenib targets multiple membrane-bound and intracellular kinases crucial in oncogenesis and angiogenesis. Its primary targets include FLT1, KDR, FLT4, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1, FGFR2, TEK, DDR2, NTRK1, EPHA2, RAF1, BRAF, MAPK11, FRK, ABL1, and RET. It is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4, UGT1A9, and other enzymes such as CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, UGT1A1, and CYP2C19. The active metabolites, M-2 and M-5, exhibit similar pharmacological activity and are substrates of P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and the breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2). 

## Pharmacogenetics
Regorafenib's metabolism by CYP3A4 and interaction with other CYP enzymes suggest significant pharmacogenetic variability based on individual enzymatic activity. Variants in the CYP3A4 enzyme, known to vary widely among individuals, can influence drug metabolism rates, affecting both efficacy and toxicity. Furthermore, UGT1A1 variations, notably in relation to Gilbert’s syndrome, could impact drug metabolism and response. Although specific pharmacogenomic data for regorafenib are limited, these enzyme systems' genetic variability could lead to personalized dosing or increased monitoring in certain populations to manage adverse effects better and optimize therapy outcomes.
