## Drug Summary
Minocycline, known by multiple brand names like Aknemin, Apo-Minocycline, and Vectrin, is a second-generation tetracycline antibiotic. It was first described in the literature in 1966 and approved by the FDA in 1971. Minocycline is effective against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and is used in the treatment of various infections including acne vulgaris, periodontitis, and numerous bacterial infections like those caused by _Rickettsiae_, _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_, and _Chlamydia_ spp. Pharmacodynamically, it binds to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, interfering with protein synthesis. Its pharmacokinetics features a peak plasma concentration in 1.9 to 2.5 hours after oral administration, and it is primarily metabolized into 9-hydroxyminocycline and other demethylated metabolites.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Minocycline targets various components crucial to bacterial viability and human inflammatory processes. It binds to bacterial 30S ribosomal proteins (like S9 and S4 of _Escherichia coli_) to inhibit protein synthesis. In humans, it interacts with inflammatory and apoptotic regulators including interleukin-1 beta (IL1B), arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5), and various matrix metalloproteinases (e.g., MMP9). It also impacts a wide array of mitogen-activated protein kinases (e.g., MAPK1, MAPK3, MAPK8) that play roles in cell signaling. Regarding transporters, Minocycline utilizes bacterial OmpF and OmpC to enter gram-negative bacteria and is transported in humans partly by SLC22A6 and SLC22A7, which are part of the solute carrier family.

## Pharmacogenetics
Minocycline has not been extensively studied for specific pharmacogenetic interactions in the same way some other drugs have. However, considering its transport by human solute carriers like SLC22A6 and SLC22A7, genetic variations in these genes might affect its pharmacokinetics and possibly the drug response or risk of side effects in individuals. More broad pharmacogenomic studies may reveal additional interactions or susceptibilities based on genetic makeup, particularly concerning its impacts on inflammatory pathways involving IL1B, ALOX5, and MMP9, or the wide range of MAPKs which are crucial in numerous cellular processes including growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. Further research could provide more insights into how genetic variability influences efficacy and safety profiles of Minocycline in individual patients.
