## Drug Summary
Cotinine glucuronide is a major urinary metabolite of nicotine, which itself is a stimulant compound commonly found in tobacco. Cotinine is formed from nicotine by the action of the enzyme CYP2A6. Upon further metabolism, cotinine is conjugated with glucuronic acid to form cotinine glucuronide, primarily facilitated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes (UGTs). This metabolite is used as a biomarker to assess the exposure to nicotine, indicating not only the use of tobacco products but also exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Its pharmacokinetics involves rapid formation and renal excretion, and it reflects nicotine intake over several days due to its relatively long half-life compared to nicotine.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Cotinine glucuronide itself does not target any specific cellular receptors or molecular targets in the body, as it is primarily a metabolite used for excretion in the urine. The formation of cotinine glucuronide involves primarily UGT enzymes, which catalyze the glucuronidation process. The specific isoforms of UGT involved in cotinine glucuronidation include UGT2B10, which is thought to be primarily responsible, and possibly UGT2B17. These enzymes facilitate its solubility and its eventual excretion via the kidneys.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic aspects of cotinine glucuronide metabolism predominantly involve genetic variations in the enzymes responsible for its formation from cotinine, particularly UGT2B10. Variations in the UGT2B10 gene can lead to different rates of metabolism, influencing the levels of cotinine glucuronide detectable in urine. This variability can affect the interpretation of urinary cotinine glucuronide levels as biomarkers of nicotine exposure. For instance, certain UGT2B10 genetic variants might result in slower metabolism, leading to lower concentrations of cotinine glucuronide. This is important for accurately assessing exposure in epidemiological studies and in clinical settings where tobacco smoke exposure needs to be quantified. No targeted pharmacogenomic guidelines exist specifically for cotinine glucuronide, but understanding these gene-enzyme relationships is crucial for interpreting metabolic biomarker data accurately.
