## Drug Summary
Tegafur is an anticancer prodrug of fluorouracil (5-FU), a widely used pyrimidine analogue functioning as a chemotherapeutic agent. Most effective in the treatment of advanced gastric and colorectal cancers, tegafur is often used in combination with other medications such as gimeracil and oteracil to modulate the biochemical pathways, improving the therapeutic effect while managing toxicity profiles. It acts by converting into 5-FU in the body after administration, with 5-FU inhibiting thymidylate synthaseâ€”a key enzyme in DNA synthesis. Tegafur is known for its dose-proportional pharmacokinetics and achieves peak concentrations in plasma 1-2 hours post oral administration. It undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism primarily mediated by CYP2A6 and other P450 enzymes to produce its active forms, which significantly affect the neoplastic cells.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Tegafur targets thymidylate synthase (TYMS), a crucial enzyme for DNA synthesis, where its active metabolite, FdUMP, inhibits the synthesis of thymidine monophosphate, a nucleotide essential for DNA replication. The metabolic conversion of tegafur to its active forms involves several cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP2A6, CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2E1, and CYP3A5. These enzymes orchestrate the initial steps of activating tegafur into 5-FU and further metabolites contributing to its antineoplastic actions. Tegafur itself does not prominently involve any specific transporters for its action or metabolism but binds to the carrier protein, thyroxine-binding globulin (SERPINA7), which might influence its distribution or excretion.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic responses to tegafur are significantly influenced by polymorphic variations in the gene DPYD which encodes dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, the primary enzyme responsible for 5-FU catabolism. Allelic variants such as rs3918290, rs55886062, rs67376798, rs1801158, rs1801159, rs1801160, and rs1801265 in DPYD have been associated with higher risks of severe toxicity when undergoing tegafur therapy. Patients harboring these variants may experience increased toxicity due to the reduced metabolic degradation of 5-FU, leading to higher systemic exposure to the drug. This underscores the importance of genotyping DPYD in individuals prior to initiating therapy with tegafur to personalize dosing and minimize adverse effects effectively.
