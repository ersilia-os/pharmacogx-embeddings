## Drug Summary
Vincristine, marketed under several brand names such as Oncovin and Marqibo, is a vinca alkaloid antineoplastic agent derived from the periwinkle plant *Catharanthus roseus*. It is used primarily in the treatment of various cancers including acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Wilmsâ€™ tumor, neuroblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. Its mechanism of action is through the inhibition of microtubule formation in the mitotic spindle, causing mitotic arrest or cell death. Vincristine is notable for its minimal bone marrow suppression at therapeutic doses but significant neurotoxicity. It undergoes hepatic metabolism predominantly by the CYP3A subfamily of cytochrome P450 enzymes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Vincristine acts primarily by binding to the tubulin proteins, specifically targeting the beta (TUBB) and alpha-4A (TUBA4A) chains. This binding disrupts the assembly of microtubules, essential components of the cell cycle mitotic spindle. Its metabolism is facilitated by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7. Vincristine is also associated with multiple transporters including P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), various subtypes of Multidrug resistance-associated proteins (e.g., ABCC1, ABCC2, ABCC3, ABCC10), and organic ion transporter families such as SLC22A3, which influence its distribution and elimination. Carriers for vincristine were not highlighted in the provided data.

## Pharmacogenetics
Vincristine pharmacogenetics predominantly involves its metabolism by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes. Variants in these genes may affect drug metabolism, leading to inter-individual differences in efficacy and toxicity. For instance, polymorphisms in CYP3A5 can lead to differential enzyme activity, influencing the drug's clearance and thus impacting susceptibility to neurotoxicity or therapeutic failure. Additionally, ABCB1 genetic variants influence the activity of P-glycoprotein, a critical transporter in the pharmacokinetics of vincristine, potentially altering drug efflux from cells and consequently modifying drug exposure and toxicity risks. The relationship between these genotypic variations and clinical outcomes can provide insights for dose adjustments and risk of adverse effects in different individuals.
