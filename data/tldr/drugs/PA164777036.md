## Drug Summary
Hydroxychloroquine, also known by trade names such as Dolquine, HCQS, Polirreumin, and Quensyl, is an aminoquinoline used primarily for the treatment and prophylaxis of malaria, as well as chronic discoid and systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis. Developed during WWII, it's a derivative of quinacrine with fewer side effects. The drug works by interfering with lysosomal activity and autophagy, altering the pH necessary for processes like antigen presentation and inflammation. Moreover, hydroxychloroquine impacts blood sugar levels, requiring monitoring in diabetic patients. It has a long duration of action, allowing for weekly dosing in some cases.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Hydroxychloroquine targets Toll-like receptors (TLR7 and TLR9) which play a role in the immune response, and ACE2, linked to its exploration as a treatment for COVID-19. The drug is metabolized primarily through cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP2C8, leading to the formation of active or inactive metabolites. Hydroxychloroquine is subject to transport mostly by proteins such as P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1) and the solute carrier family member SLCO1A2. Furthermore, serum albumin (ALB) and alpha1-acid glycoprotein (ORM2) serve as carriers, influencing its pharmacokinetic profiles.

## Pharmacogenetics
Regarding pharmacogenetic aspects, the metabolism of hydroxychloroquine via CYP3A4 and other enzymes suggests that genetic variability in these enzymes could affect drug levels and response. For example, variations in CYP3A4 activity due to genetic polymorphisms could alter the efficacy and toxicity of hydroxychloroquine. Additionally, transporters like ABCB1, which has well-documented genetic variants that affect function and expression, could also impact the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of the drug. However, specific pharmacogenetic guidelines for hydroxychloroquine are not well-established, suggesting that further research could provide more detailed recommendations for optimizing treatment based on genetic profiles.
