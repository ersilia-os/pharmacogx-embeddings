## Drug Summary
Doxorubicinol is the major active metabolite of the anthracycline drug doxorubicin, which is widely used for its antineoplastic properties. Doxorubicinol retains the anticancer activity of its parent compound doxorubicin but has a slightly different pharmacokinetic profile. Doxorubicin, and by extension doxorubicinol, interacts with DNA by intercalation and inhibition of macromolecular biosynthesis. This interaction can cause the disruption of DNA replication and transcription, leading to cell death via apoptosis in proliferating cancer cells. Doxorubicinol is primarily formed in the liver by the action of cytosolic enzymes, and its formation can significantly impact the pharmacological effectiveness and toxicity of doxorubicin.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
As the primary active metabolite of doxorubicin, doxorubicinol shares similar mechanisms of action, although detailed specific targets, enzymes, transporters, and carriers for doxorubicinol itself are less well-documented. Like doxorubicin, it is likely involved in targeting topoisomerase II, an essential enzyme for DNA replication and repair. The mechanism involves stabilizing the DNA-topoisomerase II complex, preventing the religation of the DNA strands and thereby leading to breaks in the double-strand DNA that trigger apoptosis. The transport and pharmacokinetics of doxorubicinol might be influenced by various cellular transporters and enzymes involved in doxorubicin metabolism, primarily in the liver.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of doxorubicinol predominantly parallels that of doxorubicin, given its role as a metabolite. Key genetic variations in genes encoding enzymes involved in the metabolism of doxorubicin, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP3A4 and carbonyl reductases (CBR), can influence the production and activity of doxorubicinol. Variants in these genes may affect both the effectiveness and the cardiotoxicity profile of the treatment. The pharmacogenetics of transporters such as MDR1 (gene symbol ABCB1), which mediates cellular efflux of doxorubicin, also affects doxorubicinol indirectly, as alterations in doxorubicin transport affect its availability for conversion to doxorubicinol. Clinically, genotyping these genes might help predict patient response to doxorubicin therapy and guide dosage to minimize toxicity while maximizing therapeutic efficacy.
