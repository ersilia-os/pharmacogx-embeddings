## Drug Summary
Rivastigmine, marketed under the name Exelon Patch, is a parasympathomimetic or cholinergic agent used primarily for treating mild to moderate dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. As a cholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine enhances cholinergic function by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine in the brain. This increased presence is achieved through the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE), enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis of acetylcholine. Although rivastigmine does not reverse the damage of dementia, it can improve cognitive function and retard the progression of symptoms temporarily. It is metabolized rapidly through cholinesterase-mediated hydrolysis, primarily in the liver.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary targets of rivastigmine are ACHE (Acetylcholinesterase) and BCHE (Cholinesterase), both key enzymes in the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Rivastigmine binds reversibly with these enzymes, inactivating them, which prevents acetylcholine breakdown and effectively increases its concentration at synaptic clefts in the brain. This action helps ameliorate the cholinergic deficits observed in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease-related dementia. The specificity of rivastigmine for brain cholinesterases over peripheral cholinesterases minimizes systemic side effects. There are no significant interactions involving transporters or carriers according to the provided data.

## Pharmacogenetics
As of the provided data, there are no specific pharmacogenetic details listed in the context of rivastigmine. However, the pharmacogenetic implications of dementia treatment suggest potential variability in drug metabolism and response linked to genetic differences in enzymes like ACHE and BCHE. Variants in these genes may affect the efficacy and safety of the drug, altering the rate at which acetylcholine is broken down and thus its availability in the brain. Although such inferences are not detailed here explicitly from clinical data, they could form an essential aspect of personalized medicine in dementia treatment. Additionally, research and further studies could provide more insights into how genetic variations influence treatment outcomes with rivastigmine.
