## Drug Summary
Etravirine is an antiretroviral medication classified as a Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI), specifically designed for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. It received FDA approval for this purpose in 2007, with subsequent approvals including pediatric use. Etravirine works by directly inhibiting the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase enzyme, integral to the viral replication process. This inhibition blocks both DNA-dependent and RNA-dependent polymerase activities. It does not affect human DNA polymerases, indicating a selective mechanism of action against the viral enzyme. For effective treatment, etravirine must be administered in combination with other antiretroviral agents. The drug is primarily metabolized by liver enzymes CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, with maximum oral absorption occurring between 2.5 and 4 hours post-administration. Its pharmacokinetics can be influenced by food, as fasting conditions can significantly reduce drug exposure.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Etravirine targets the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase enzyme, which is part of the Gag-Pol polyprotein, critical for the viral replication process. The drug binds directly to the reverse transcriptase component thereby inhibiting its function. Etravirine is metabolized predominantly by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 in the liver. This metabolic process primarily involves the methyl hydroxylation of the dimethylbenzonitrile moiety of etravirine, resulting in less active metabolites. Additionally, etravirine interacts with transport proteins, including ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1) and ABCB4 (Multidrug resistance protein 3), which may affect its distribution and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic aspects of etravirine involve primarily its metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Variations in genes encoding these enzymes, such as CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, can affect the drugâ€™s plasma levels, efficacy, and side effect profile. For instance, genetic polymorphisms in CYP3A4 may alter the rate of drug metabolism, leading to variable therapeutic outcomes or adverse effects. Similarly, mutations in transporter proteins like ABCB1 could influence drug distribution and the potential for drug-drug interactions. While specific pharmacogenetic testing guidelines for etravirine are not well-established, monitoring for genetic variations in these enzymes and transporters might be beneficial in optimizing therapy and minimizing toxicity, particularly in patients with unusual or severe side effects or those who fail therapy despite adherence.
