## Drug Summary
Fenoterol, marketed under names like Alveofen, Berotec, Berotec N, Cenfenol, and Partusisten, belongs to the class of drugs known as beta-2 adrenergic agonists. It is primarily used as a bronchodilator in the treatment of asthma and as a tocolytic agent for delaying preterm labor. The mechanism of Fenoterol involves stimulating beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the lungs, leading to the relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle, subsequent bronchodilation, and increased airflow. This action helps alleviate symptoms of bronchoconstriction in asthma patients. The drug is metabolized in the liver, but specific details on absorption are not provided in the summary.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Fenoterol acts primarily through engagement with the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2), promoting bronchodilation and airflow improvement. Although the drug also has affinity towards beta-1 (ADRB1) and beta-3 (ADRB3) adrenergic receptors, its primary clinical effects are attributed to ADRB2 activation. The interaction with ADRB1 and ADRB3 could potentially contribute to side effects involving the cardiovascular system. Fenoterol does not have specified interactions with any enzymes, transporters, or carriers according to the provided data, focusing its action mainly on receptor binding.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors influencing the efficacy and safety of Fenoterol largely relate to variations in the genes encoding its targetsâ€”specifically the ADRB2 gene. Variations in this gene may affect the individual's response to Fenoterol, altering bronchodilatory efficacy or the risk of adverse effects. For example, certain polymorphisms in the ADRB2 gene have been associated with differential beta-agonist response in asthma patients, suggesting that genetic testing might be valuable in optimizing therapy for specific individuals. However, detailed pharmacogenetic data specific to Fenoterol is not extensive, and further research may be needed to confirm these associations and to develop personalized asthma management strategies based on genetic profiles.
