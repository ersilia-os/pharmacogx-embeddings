## Drug Summary
Tafenoquine, an 8-aminoquinoline derivative discovered by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, was approved by the FDA in 2018. It is used primarily for the prevention and treatment of relapses in Vivax malaria. Tafenoquine differs from its counterpart primaquine by the presence of a 5-phenoxy group, which enhances its efficacy against relapsing malaria. The drug exhibits its pharmacodynamic properties by reducing the transmission of _Plasmodium vivax_, especially potent against chloroquine-resistant _P. falciparum_ strains. Pharmacokinetics data suggests a Tmax of 13.8 hours, with bioavailability improved by a high-fat meal. Tafenoquine’s mechanism of action purportedly involves the inhibition of heme polymerase and the production of reactive oxygen species that are toxic to the parasite.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The targets of tafenoquine have not been specifically listed, but the drug mechanism includes inhibition of heme polymerase and interaction with oxidative stress pathways in malaria parasites. It is metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) in humans, producing active metabolites that further attack the parasite. Additionally, the drug interacts with cellular transporters including SLC22A2, SLC47A1, and SLC47A2. These interactions involve transport processes that may affect the drug's distribution and excretion. 

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetics plays a significant role in the activity and safety of tafenoquine. The enzyme CYP2D6 is crucial for its activation, implying variability in drug efficacy and safety among individuals with different CYP2D6 genotypes. For instance, poor metabolizers may have reduced efficacy of the drug due to inadequate activation of tafenoquine. Moreover, tafenoquine can cause hemolysis in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, a genetic variant more prevalent in certain populations. This susceptibility is due to the increased oxidative stress generated by the drug’s metabolites, which G6PD-deficient individuals cannot sufficiently neutralize. Understanding these pharmacogenetic implications is vital for tailoring individual treatment plans and mitigating adverse effects.
