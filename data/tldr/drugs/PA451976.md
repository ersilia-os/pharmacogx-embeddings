## Drug Summary
Zolpidem, known commercially under various names including Ambien, Stilnox, and others, is a hypnotic drug approved for the short-term treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep initiation. Structurally distinct from benzodiazepines, zolpidem selectively binds to the benzodiazepine (BZ1) receptor subtype associated with the GABA_A receptor, promoting sleep without extensive effects on muscle relaxation or anticonvulsant activity. Zolpidem is rapidly absorbed, with its pharmacological effects manifesting quickly after administration. Generally, it is well tolerated when used as directed, though it carries risks of next-day psychomotor impairment and anterograde amnesia, particularly at higher doses. Zolpidem's capacity to reduce sleep latency and improve sleep maintenance with minimal rebound insomnia upon discontinuation makes it a prescribed choice for transient insomnia management.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Zolpidem primarily targets GABA_A receptor subunits GABRA1, GABRA2, GABRA3, and GABRG2, enhancing the inhibitory effect of GABA and contributing to its sedative effects. This action occurs via the selective affinity for the alpha subunits of the GABA_A receptor, focusing mainly on alpha1, involving less of the alpha5 subunit. Metabolism of zolpidem is predominantly carried out by hepatic enzymes, particularly CYP3A4, along with contributions from CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, leading to the formation of inactive metabolites. There are no significant transporters or carriers noted in the pharmacokinetics of zolpidem that would facilitate or inhibit its action.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic aspects of zolpidem involve its metabolism largely by the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Genetic variability in enzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 may influence the metabolism rate of zolpidem, affecting drug plasma levels and consequently, its efficacy and safety profile. For instance, individuals with reduced activity alleles of CYP3A4 might experience prolonged drug action, increasing the risk of next-day impairment. Similarly, variations in CYP2C9 could alter zolpidem clearance, potentially requiring dose adjustments to mitigate side effects or therapeutic failure. Further research and clinical validation are vital to establish precise pharmacogenetic guidelines to optimize zolpidem therapy based on these genetic factors.
