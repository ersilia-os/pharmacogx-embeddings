## Drug Summary
Lacidipine, marketed under various names such as Caldine, Lacimen, Lacipil, and Motens, belongs to the class of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. It is primarily used for the management of hypertension, either as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents like β-adrenoceptor antagonists, diuretics, and ACE inhibitors. Lacidipine inhibits voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle, which decreases calcium influx, leading to vasodilation, reduced peripheral vascular resistance, and lower blood pressure. The drug is known for its slow onset and long duration of action, which mitigates the risk of reflex tachycardia—a common side effect with other fast-acting dihydropyridines. Lacidipine also exhibits significant antioxidant properties which may contribute to potential antiatherosclerotic effects.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Lacidipine targets several subunits of the voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels, specifically CACNA1C, CACNA1D, CACNA1F, CACNA1S, CACNB1, CACNB2, CACNB3, CACNB4, and CACNA1A. This broad spectrum of activity reinforces its effectiveness in reducing vascular smooth muscle contraction and blood pressure. Metabolism of lacidipine is predominantly through CYP3A4-mediated hepatic pathways, with its metabolites displaying no significant pharmacological activity. Noteworthy is its absence in urine or feces, indicating comprehensive metabolic processing. Regarding transport and binding, lacidipine interacts with serum albumin (ALB) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1), which may influence its distribution and pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
Lacidipine's metabolism by CYP3A4 suggests potential pharmacogenetic variability in response and tolerability among individuals. Variations in CYP3A4 activity, which could be due to genetic polymorphisms or influence from other medications, might affect the drug’s efficacy and safety profile. Patients with genetic variations influencing CYP3A4 expression or function may experience altered therapeutic outcomes or side effects. Since precise pharmacogenetic data specific to lacidipine is not extensively documented, inference from other CYP3A4 substrates may guide anticipatory clinical adjustments. Nonetheless, monitoring for unusual responses in patients on lacidipine, potentially attributable to genetic differences, remains a prudent approach especially in polypharmacy contexts.
