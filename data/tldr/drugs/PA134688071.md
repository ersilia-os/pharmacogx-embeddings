## Drug Summary
Atomoxetine, known commercially as Strattera, is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) primarily used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in both children and adults. It serves an important role as a non-stimulant option in ADHD management, especially beneficial for patients where stimulants are contraindicated due to side effects or abuse potential. Atomoxetine enhances norepinephrine and dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex, crucial for managing ADHD symptoms without significantly affecting other areas like the nucleus accumbens or striatum, which reduces its abuse potential. The drug is absorbed variably based on genetic differences in metabolism (affected by CYP2D6 polymorphism) and has a bioavailability that differs markedly between extensive and poor metabolizers.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Atomoxetine acts by inhibiting the norepinephrine transporter (NET), primarily localized in the prefrontal cortex, represented by the target gene SLC6A2. This inhibition is critical for its effectiveness in ADHD. It also interacts with the serotonin transporter (SERT - SLC6A4) and blocks various NMDA receptor subunits (GRIN1, GRIN2A-D, GRIN3A-B), suggesting additional modulatory roles in neurotransmission. Atomoxetine's metabolism is predominantly through CYP2D6, with CYP2C19 also contributing. The genetic variability in these enzymes significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of the drug. Atomoxetine also binds to several protein carriers including serum albumin (ALB), alpha1-acid glycoprotein (ORM2), and the high affinity immunoglobulin gamma Fc receptor I (FCGR1A) which may influence its distribution and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic aspects of atomoxetine treatment are prominently influenced by the activity of the CYP2D6 enzyme. Variants such as rs35742686, rs3892097, rs5030655, rs1135824, and rs28371733 in CYP2D6 are associated with poor metabolism of the drug, leading to higher plasma levels and an increased likelihood of side effects. These genetic variations necessitate adjustments in dosing or careful monitoring for adverse effects. Understanding and testing for these CYP2D6 variants can be crucial in optimizing therapeutic outcomes and minimizing risks in patients prescribed atomoxetine for ADHD.
