## Drug Summary
Sirolimus, also known as rapamycin, is a macrocyclic lactone derived from *Streptomyces hygroscopicus*. Initially identified for its antifungal properties, its utility significantly expanded due to its immunosuppressive and antitumor effects. It acts primarily via the inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that regulates cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Sirolimus is approved by the FDA for prophylaxis of organ rejection in renal transplant patients over the age of 13, and in some contexts, itâ€™s used in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Additional indications include the treatment of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, facial angiofibroma in tuberous sclerosis, and certain advanced perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComa). It is administered both orally and intravenously, with notable differences in bioequivalence between its tablet and solution forms.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Sirolimus's primary target is mTOR, to which it binds after forming a complex with FKBP12 (FK506-binding protein), leading to inhibition of T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation. The drug undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver and intestinal walls mainly via CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 enzymes, playing a crucial role in its biotransformation into pharmacologically inactive metabolites. Transport is mediated by several proteins including ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), SLCO1B1, and SLC47A1, which influence its absorption and distribution. Additionally, sirolimus binds to various carriers such as serum albumin (ALB), alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (ORM1), and apolipoproteins (LPA), affecting its bioavailability and plasma distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors considerably influence sirolimus's effectiveness and safety profile. Variants in the genes encoding its metabolizing enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, can significantly affect its metabolism, leading to variability in drug levels and responses among individuals. For instance, CYP3A5 expressers typically require higher doses to achieve therapeutic levels due to faster drug metabolism. Similarly, genetic variations in the ABCB1 gene, encoding for P-glycoprotein, can alter the drug's absorption and distribution, thus impacting therapeutic outcomes and potential side effects. Although specific clinical guidelines for dosing based on genetic makeup are not universally standardized, individualized therapy considering these genetic variations could optimize efficacy and minimize toxicity in clinical settings.
