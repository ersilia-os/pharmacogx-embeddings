## Drug Summary
Deferiprone is an oral iron chelator primarily utilized as a second-line therapy in thalassemia syndromes associated with transfusional iron overload. This condition often arises as a consequence of multiple blood transfusions required to manage thalassemias, which are hereditary anemia disorders characterized by a defect in hemoglobin production. Deferiprone binds selectively to ferric ions (Fe3+) creating a 3:1 stable complex which facilitates iron excretion in the urine. This drug was approved by the FDA on October 14, 2011. Its absorption is rapid and efficient, occurring primarily in the upper gastrointestinal tract, with peak plasma concentrations reached within 1 to 2 hours (depending on fed or fasted state). Deferiprone is mainly metabolized by the enzyme UGT1A6 to its 3-O-glucuronide which is inactive for iron chelation.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Deferiprone acts through the mechanism of iron chelation, forming stable complexes with ferric iron which are then excreted. It does not target proteins directly for its primary therapeutic action, hence no specific drug targets like receptors or enzymes are involved in its direct mechanism of action. For its metabolism, deferiprone is processed predominantly by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-6 (UGT1A6), which transforms it into an inactive 3-O-glucuronide derivative that lacks iron-chelating capacity. There are no specific transporters or carriers indicated in the drug’s pharmacokinetic profile, focusing the action and disposition of the drug largely on its interaction with iron and the subsequent metabolic conversion by UGT1A6.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic insights into deferiprone primarily relate to the metabolism of the drug by the enzyme UGT1A6. Variability in the UGT1A6 gene could potentially influence the pharmacokinetics of deferiprone, affecting the rate and extent of metabolite formation and thus the drug’s efficiency or toxicity profiles. However, specific, actionable pharmacogenetic associations involving deferiprone have yet to be extensively characterized in the literature. Further research could elucidate more defined guidance on how genetic variations in UGT1A6 or other genes might impact deferiprone response or risk of side effects such as agranulocytosis or hepatotoxicity, which have been noted as significant concerns. As of now, clinical considerations of genotyping before deferiprone use are not specifically recommended or implemented in routine practice.
