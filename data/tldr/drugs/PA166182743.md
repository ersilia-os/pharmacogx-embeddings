## Drug Summary
Lorlatinib, commercially identified as DB12130 in DrugBank, is a third-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). It's specifically designed for the treatment of ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Lorlatinib gained FDA approval in November 2018 and EMA approval in 2019, rising to a first-line treatment option by 2022. This drug is administered orally, demonstrating high bioavailability (81%) and quick median Tmax post-dosage. Lorlatinib is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 and UGT1A4 and is distinguished by its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, effectively targeting brain metastases. It's particularly useful for patients who have progressed on other ALK inhibitors such as crizotinib, alectinib, or ceritinib.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Lorlatinib acts primary by inhibition of the ALK tyrosine kinase receptor, crucial in NSCLC cases driven by ALK gene rearrangement. Additionally, it exhibits activity against a range of tyrosine kinase receptors including ROS1 and others involved in neural development and cell proliferation. The absorption and systemic availability of lorlatinib are subject to metabolic processing predominantly via CYP3A4 and UGT1A4 along with lesser involvement from CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP3A5, and UGT1A3. No specific transporters or carriers are noted, and its distribution and pharmacokinetics underscore its central nervous system availability, significant for NSCLC with brain metastases.

## Pharmacogenetics
Lorlatinib's effectiveness and safety can be influenced by genetic variations primarily related to its metabolic pathways, notably CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Variants in these genes may affect lorlatinib plasma levels and, consequently, its efficacy and toxicity. Patients with CYP3A5 expressers might experience different pharmacokinetics due to the enzyme's role in lorlatinib metabolism. The substantial dependence on these pathways suggests a potential need for dose adjustments based on individual genetic makeup, although specific genotype-guided dosing recommendations are not currently detailed in the prescribing information. Further pharmacogenetic research could refine these aspects to optimize lorlatinib's therapeutic outcomes.
