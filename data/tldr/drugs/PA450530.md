## Drug Summary
Modafinil, also known by other names such as Alertex, Aspendos, and Provigil among others, is a stimulant primarily used to treat narcolepsy and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). It functions as a "wakefulness promoting agent," facilitating wakefulness by stimulating certain neurotransmitter systems in the brain. Notably, modafinil activates the orexin neurons, which are closely linked to wakefulness. Pharmacodynamically, it inhibits the dopamine reuptake pump leading to increased extracellular dopamine and has secondary effects on glutamatergic circuits and GABA inhibition. Furthermore, modafinil has been employed to assist in the recovery of cocaine addiction by reducing dependence symptoms. It exhibits rapid absorption when administered orally and undergoes hepatic metabolism.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Modafinil interacts with key targets such as the SLC6A3 (Sodium-dependent dopamine transporter) and ADRA1B (Alpha-1B adrenergic receptor), which respectively influence dopaminergic and adrenergic signaling pathways contributing to its stimulation and wake-promotion properties. It engages multiple hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, involved in its biotransformation and elimination. The interactions with these enzymes are crucial for understanding modafinil's pharmacokinetics and potential drug-drug interactions.

## Pharmacogenetics
Modafinil's effects can vary significantly with genetic variations, particularly those related to the COMT (catechol-O-methyltransferase) gene. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4680 in COMT can influence the therapeutic response to modafinil. Patients with certain genotypes at this SNP display differential improvements in vigor and well-being when using modafinil. For example, one variant might result in reduced improvements, whereas another leads to increased benefits from the drug. This genetic interaction underscores the importance of considering genetic makeup when prescribing modafinil and predicting its efficacy and safety among different individuals.
