## Drug Summary
Cytarabine, also known by its trade names Ara-C and Cytosar-U, is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog predominantly used in the treatment of various leukemias, including acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and blast phase chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML). It is frequently used in combination with other agents such as daunorubicin for treating newly-diagnosed therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC). Cytarabine functions as an antimetabolite antineoplastic agent, disrupting DNA synthesis by impersonating the nucleosides that form the building blocks of DNA during the S phase of the cell cycle, thereby inhibiting cellular replication and growth. It has a specific action on cells in the DNA synthesis (S) phase, and minor absorption when administered orally (less than 20% bioavailability), typically necessitating parenteral administration for effective therapy.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Cytarabine acts primarily by inhibiting DNA polymerases, such as DNA polymerase beta (POLB), and by incorporating into DNA, thereby stalling replication. The drug is metabolized intracellularly into active triphosphate form by enzymes including Deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) and Cytidine deaminase (CDA). These enzymes are critical in the activation and deactivation pathways of the drug. Metabolism also involves enzymes like Deoxycytidylate deaminase (DCTD) and 5'-nucleotidase (NT5E). Additionally, certain transporters, such as Equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (SLC29A1), solute carrier family 22 member 4 (SLC22A4), and Multidrug resistance-associated protein 7 (ABCC10), play essential roles in the transportation and efficacy of cytarabine within the body.

## Pharmacogenetics
Cytarabine's pharmacogenetics involves significant inter-individual variability in treatment response and toxicity, often due to genetic variations in the enzymes that metabolize the drug. Variations in the gene encoding Deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) - a key activating enzyme - can affect the drug's efficacy, as the active form of cytarabine (cytarabine triphosphate) is less available in cells when DCK activity is compromised. Cytidine deaminase (CDA) gene polymorphisms also influence cytarabine metabolism, potentially altering toxicity profiles and therapeutic outcomes. Patients with certain CDA variants might experience increased toxicity due to slower inactivation of the drug. Hence, pharmacogenetic testing might be beneficial in optimizing cytarabine dosing and minimizing adverse effects, although specific actionable genetic markers are still under investigation in the clinical and research settings.
