## Drug Summary
Methazolamide (also known as Naptazane) is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor primarily used in the treatment of glaucoma, particularly chronic open-angle glaucoma and acute angle-closure glaucoma. The drug operates by reducing the elevated intraocular pressure associated with these conditions. Methazolamide exerts its effects through the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye, leading to decreased aqueous humor secretion. This action is achieved by slowing the formation of bicarbonate ions, which in turn reduces sodium and fluid transport. Although methazolamide can also cause a diuretic effect, this is generally weak and transient. It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but does not undergo significant metabolism.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Methazolamide targets several isoforms of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, including CA1, CA2, CA3, CA4, and CA7. These target enzymes are primarily expressed in human tissues and are involved in the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide. Methazolamide’s inhibitory action on these enzymes underpins its therapeutic effects in reducing intraocular pressure. Although specific metabolic enzymes are not listed, methazolamide's interaction with transporters includes the solute carrier family 22 member 6 (SLC22A6), which may play a role in its renal excretion or absorption processes. No specific carriers are identified for methazolamide, and the drug’s primary pharmacological effects are related to its interaction with carbonic anhydrase enzymes.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there is limited direct pharmacogenetic data associated with methazolamide in the provided information. However, based on its pharmacological profile as a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, genetic variations in the carbonic anhydrase genes (e.g., CA1, CA2, CA3) could potentially influence the drug’s efficacy and safety profile in individual patients. Variants that alter the expression or activity of these enzymes might affect the therapeutic outcomes or risk of adverse effects. Additionally, the interaction with SLC22A6 suggests potential relevance of genetic variants in this transporter that could impact drug handling. Further research could help clarify these pharmacogenetic associations, potentially leading to more personalized approaches in the management of glaucoma with methazolamide.
