## Drug Summary
Pegaptanib, marketed under various names including Macugen, is a polynucleotide aptamer approved by the FDA in 2004 for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD). It functions primarily by antagonizing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a key molecule implicated in angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and inflammation associated with the progression of wet AMD. Pegaptanib selectively binds to the VEGF165 isoform, which is particularly involved in the pathological processes of wet AMD, thereby preventing its interaction with cellular receptors. This drug’s pharmacokinetics involves slow absorption into the systemic circulation from the eye after intravitreous (inside the vitreous humor of the eye) administration, and it is metabolized by endo- and exonucleases as evidenced from preclinical studies.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Pegaptanib’s mechanism of action revolves around its target, VEGF-A (vascular endothelial growth factor A), particularly its isoform VEGF165. It blocks this isoform’s activity, which is crucial in mediating the excessive angiogenesis and increased vascular permeability seen in wet AMD. There are no specific enzymes, transporters, or carriers listed for pegaptanib, which suggests that its metabolism and transport might follow generic cellular processes involving nucleases, rather than being mediated by specific proteins involved in drug metabolism or transport.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there is no direct pharmacogenetic data provided for pegaptanib, which implies that its efficacy and safety profile may not have established correlations with specific genetic variations in the general or patient population. However, given its target on VEGF, genetic variations in the VEGF gene or its pathway components could theoretically influence patient responses or adverse effects, although such associations would require further empirical validation. In pharmacogenetic practice, monitoring for genetic factors that affect VEGF levels or activity could potentially be relevant for predicting treatment outcomes with pegaptanib in wet AMD.
