## Drug Summary
Nevirapine, a member of the dipyridodiazepinone class, is a potent non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) utilized predominantly in combination treatments for HIV-1 infection and AIDS. It is specifically indicated for use with other antiretrovirals when the immune system has started to decline and signs of infection appear. Nevirapine functions by directly binding and inhibiting the reverse transcriptase enzyme of HIV-1, preventing viral RNA from being transcribed into DNA, a critical step in the viral replication cycle. It exhibits high bioavailability, achieving over 90% absorption following oral intake, and it is metabolized extensively in the liver primarily via cytochrome P450 3A4, forming various hydroxylated metabolites.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Nevirapine has a well-defined target: the reverse transcriptase enzyme from HIV-1, where it interferes with both the RNA-dependent and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase actions. This drug undergoes significant metabolism mediated by several enzymes, predominantly cytochromes P450 including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP3A5, CYP2C9, and CYP2A6. Nevirapine also involves a transporter, namely SLC22A1 (solute carrier family 22 member 1), and a major carrier protein, ALB (serum albumin), which may influence its distribution and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors significantly impact the efficacy and safety of nevirapine. Polymorphisms in CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 can notably influence the metabolic rate of nevirapine, affecting both drug levels and response. Specifically, certain allelic variants of CYP2B6 are associated with slower metabolism, potentially leading to higher drug exposure and increased risk of adverse effects like skin rashes and liver toxicity. Additionally, variations in genes encoding for the transporter SLC22A1 could modify the drug's pharmacokinetics. Screening for genetic variants in these enzymes before commencing therapy might guide dosage adjustments and improve therapeutic outcomes, mitigating potential adverse effects associated with nevirapine therapy.
