## Drug Summary
Estrone sulfate is an estrogenic hormone and a major estrogen in postmenopausal women, as well as a metabolic precursor to estradiol. Medically, estrone sulfate is utilized in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) primarily to combat and manage symptoms associated with menopause, such as hot flashes, osteoporosis, and vaginal atrophy. It is administered either orally or transdermally. Metabolically, estrone sulfate is converted to the more active estrogen, estradiol, when required by the body, which enables a steady-state reservoir of estrogenic activity. The pharmacokinetics of estrone sulfate includes its absorption from the intestinal tract when taken orally, followed by extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver, and elimination through renal and fecal pathways. 

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Although specific targets, enzymes, transporters, and carriers are not detailed in the provided dataset, estrone sulfate generally interacts with estrogen receptors (ERs), particularly ERα and ERβ, to exert its biological effects. These receptors are part of the nuclear receptor family and mediate the transcription of targeted genes responsible for various physiological functions, including reproductive system regulation and bone maintenance. Estrone and its transformations depend on key enzymes such as sulfatase, which converts estrone sulfate to the more active estradiol, and aromatase, which plays a role in the synthesis of estrogens from androgens.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of estrone sulfate involves genes that encode for estrogen receptors and enzymes like sulfatase and aromatase. Genetic variants in these genes can affect individual responses to hormone therapy. For instance, polymorphisms in the estrogen receptor genes (ESR1 and ESR2) may influence the efficacy and safety of estrone sulfate as a therapeutic agent, potentially impacting the therapeutic outcomes in hormone replacement therapy. Furthermore, genetic variations in enzymes like sulfatase (encoded by STS) and aromatase (CYP19A1) can modify the metabolism of estrone sulfate into estradiol, thereby influencing both circulating levels of active estrogens and associated risk profiles for certain conditions like estrogen-dependent cancers. However, specific pharmacogenetic guidelines or recommendations regarding estrone sulfate use based on genetic profiles are still under investigation and not fully established.
