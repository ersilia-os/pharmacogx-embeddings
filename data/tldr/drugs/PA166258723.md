## Drug Summary
Tenofovir alafenamide, marketed under the brand name Genvoya among others, is a prodrug of tenofovir, primarily used for the treatment of HIV-1 and chronic hepatitis B virus infections. Developed by Gilead Sciences Inc. with FDA approval in 2015, it offers a superior renal safety profile and increased potency at lower dosages compared to its predecessor, tenofovir disoproxil. The drug is designed for better intracellular delivery of the active metabolite tenofovir diphosphate, achieving lower systemic but higher intracellular concentrations due to its optimized absorption and metabolic activation. This pharmacokinetic profile minimizes systemic exposure, therby improving safety, particularly renal and bone safety.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Tenofovir alafenamide functions through the inhibition of viral reverse transcriptase enzymes (both in HIV and HBV), disrupting viral DNA synthesis. Key enzymes involved in the metabolic activation of tenofovir alafenamide include cathepsin A (CTSA) and carboxylesterase 1 (CES1), which convert the prodrug to the active drug. Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) also plays a minimal role in its metabolism. The drug's absorption and distribution are facilitated by various transporters such as P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), Multidrug resistance-associated proteins (ABCC4), and several members of the solute carrier family (e.g., SLC22A6, SLCO1B1, and SLCO1B3). Albumin (ALB) is noted as a carrier, possibly impacting its systemic circulation and distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of tenofovir alafenamide is an area of active research, especially focusing on variants within genes encoding for transporters and enzymes involved in its metabolism like SLCO1B1, ABCB1, and CES1. Several studies suggest that genetic variations in these genes could influence drug levels and response. For instance, polymorphisms in SLCO1B1 may affect the hepatic uptake of tenofovir alafenamide, thereby modifying drug effectiveness and safety profile. Moreover, variations in CES1 might alter hydrolysis rate, impacting the active drug concentration. However, specific actionable pharmacogenetic markers have yet to be fully established and standardized in clinical practice. Understanding the genetic influences on the drug's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics could be crucial for tailoring therapies to enhance efficacy and minimize adverse effects.
