## Drug Summary
Amlodipine, marketed under numerous brand names such as Amlocard, Amlodipine 5, and Amlovasc, is a widely used antihypertensive agent belonging to the dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers. Approved by the FDA in 1987, it is primarily indicated for the management of hypertension and various forms of angina, including chronic stable angina and vasospastic angina (Prinzmetal’s angina). Amlodipine is distinctive for its long-acting nature, which allows for once-daily dosing, contributing to patient adherence. It operates by inhibiting the influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle, leading to vasodilation and thereby lowering blood pressure. Amlodipine also has hemodynamic effects without significantly affecting heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with long-term use.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Amlodipine acts on several targets, primarily the voltage-dependent L-type calcium channel subunit alpha-1C (CACNA1C), among others like CACNA1I, CACNA1B, CACNB1, and CACNA2D3. These channels mediate the influx of calcium ions when they are activated, thus playing a pivotal role in the contraction of cardiac and vascular smooth muscle. The bioavailability and systemic effects of amlodipine are influenced by its metabolism mainly through hepatic enzymes including CYP3A4, CYP1A1, CYP2B6, CYP3A5, CYP2C8, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP2C9. Furthermore, it is associated with the transporter P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), which can influence drug disposition and effects.

## Pharmacogenetics
In terms of pharmacogenetics, variations in genes encoding the enzymes responsible for amlodipine metabolism, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, can influence its pharmacokinetics and subsequently its efficacy and toxicity. Polymorphisms in these genes may lead to variability in how different individuals process amlodipine. For example, individuals with variant alleles of CYP3A5 might exhibit different metabolic rates, impacting both drug levels and blood pressure control. Additionally, the transporter gene ABCB1 has polymorphisms that could affect the drug’s pharmacodynamics, potentially altering the response to therapy. Furthermore, there is a genomic association noted in DrugBank, where patients with the genotype rs5065 in NPPA have an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes when treated with diuretics, indicating potential interactive effects when used in combination therapies. This data bolsters the need for personalized medicine approaches in managing patients on amlodipine, especially when used in polypharmacy regimes.
