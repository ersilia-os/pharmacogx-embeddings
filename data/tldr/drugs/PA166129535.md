## Drug Summary
Mizolastine, also known by its brand name Mizollen, is an antihistamine that has been primarily used for the treatment of allergic conditions such as rhinitis. It has been under investigation to confirm its bioequivalence in different formulations, as illustrated by the clinical trial NCT01928316, which studies the bioequivalence of domestic (Made in China) versus imported mizolastine tablets in healthy volunteers. The therapeutic class of mizolastine involves histamine receptor antagonism, specifically targeting H1 receptors to mitigate allergic symptoms. Details on its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are not extensively documented in the provided data.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The specific molecular targets of mizolastine are not detailed in the provided DrugBank entry. However, like other antihistamines, it likely acts on histamine H1 receptors to exert its anti-allergic effects. According to the data, the drug is metabolized primarily by the enzyme Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). No specific transporters or carriers associated with mizolastine have been mentioned in the provided information.

## Pharmacogenetics
Mizolastine's metabolism by CYP2D6 suggests potential pharmacogenetic implications, as CYP2D6 is known for its genetic polymorphism with implications for drug metabolism variability among individuals. Patients with different CYP2D6 metabolizer statuses (poor, intermediate, extensive, or ultrarapid) may exhibit variations in the drug's pharmacokinetics and potentially its effects and side-effects. For instance, poor metabolizers might experience enhanced pharmacological effects or increased risk of toxicity due to slower metabolism of the drug. Conversely, ultrarapid metabolizers may require higher doses to achieve therapeutic effects. However, specific pharmacogenetic data on mizolastine itself is not provided and these implications are inferred based on the metabolism pathway. Further investigation and clinical consideration may be necessary to tailor mizolastine therapy according to individual genetic backgrounds.
