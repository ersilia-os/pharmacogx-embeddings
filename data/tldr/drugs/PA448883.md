## Drug Summary
Cephalexin is a widely used antibiotic belonging to the first generation of cephalosporins. It was approved by the FDA in 1971 and is primarily used to treat bacterial infections by inhibiting cell wall synthesis, leading to bacterial cell lysis and death. It is effective against a range of Gram-positive bacteria and is indicated for the treatment of respiratory tract infections, skin infections, bone infections, and genitourinary tract infections. Cephalexin is well absorbed in the upper intestine and boasts nearly 100% oral bioavailability. Notably, it is not metabolized in the body, and thus the unaltered drug is excreted in urine.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Cephalexin acts by targeting several penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in bacteria such as *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, including PBP3, PBP2A, PBP1B, PenA (PBP2B), and PbpA (PBP1A). These PBPs are crucial for bacterial cell wall synthesis, and their inhibition compromises cell wall integrity. Cephalexin is absorbed and potentially affected by various transporters including SLC22A5, SLC15A1, SLC15A2, SLC22A6, SLC47A1, and SLC22A8, which may impact its pharmacokinetics. Additionally, it is carried by serum albumin (ALB), which could influence its distribution in the body.

## Pharmacogenetics
As cephalexin is not metabolized and mainly excreted unchanged, the pharmacogenetics primarily focuses on variations in transporter proteins that may influence drug levels and efficacy. The involvement of specific transporters such as SLC22A6 (organic anion transporter) and SLC15A1 (peptide transporter) suggests that genetic variations in these transporter genes could affect the pharmacokinetics of cephalexin. Although specific pharmacogenetic guidelines are not established for cephalexin, variations in these transporters could potentially lead to differences in drug absorption and excretion rates among individuals, affecting drug effectiveness and safety. Further studies would be required to establish concrete pharmacogenetic associations.
