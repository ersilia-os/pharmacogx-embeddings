## Drug Summary
Dronabinol is a synthetic form of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ⁹-THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. It acts as a weak partial agonist at cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. Dronabinol is employed therapeutically to stimulate appetite in AIDS patients experiencing weight loss and to treat nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have not responded to standard antiemetic therapies. Pharmacokinetically, dronabinol shows high absorption rates, but due to significant first-pass hepatic metabolism and high lipid solubility, only a smaller percentage reaches systemic circulation. It is metabolized in the liver predominantly by cytochrome P450 enzymes, producing both active and inactive metabolites.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Dronabinol's mechanism of action primarily involves interaction with cannabinoid receptors. It targets Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and Cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2). A wide array of enzymes are involved in the metabolism of dronabinol, predominantly including CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2J2, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, CES1, PTGS1, UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT1A10. It is also a substrate for some key drug transporters like ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2), ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), and ABCC1 (Multidrug resistance-associated protein 1), which can affect its distribution and elimination from the body. There are no specific carriers mentioned for dronabinol.

## Pharmacogenetics
Dronabinol's pharmacogenetic implications involve several enzymes and transporters. Variations in the genes encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes, especially CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, could influence dronabinol's metabolism, thus affecting its efficacy and safety. Polymorphisms in these enzymes may lead to altered pharmacokinetic profiles resulting in either subtherapeutic effects or increased risk of adverse effects. Additionally, genetic variability in the ABC transporters like ABCB1 might affect the drug’s distribution and response. Currently, there’s limited direct clinical evidence linking specific genetic variants with dronabinol's pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetics. However, given the involvement of these enzymes and transporters, genetic variability could presumably be an important factor in individual responses to dronabinol, informing an area for further research to optimize dosing and minimize adverse effects based on genetic makeup.
