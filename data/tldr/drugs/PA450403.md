## Drug Summary
Metamfetamine, commonly known as methamphetamine, is a potent central nervous system (CNS) stimulant in the amphetamine class of drugs. It is medically used for the treatment of Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity (ADHD) and to manage exogenous obesity. Methamphetamine works by enhancing the release and inhibiting the reuptake of neurotransmitters like norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin, leading to increased alertness, energy, and focus, reduction in fatigue and appetite, and euphoria. It has a high potential for abuse and addiction, resulting in severe physical and psychological effects, and its non-medical use is highly regulated in many countries. Absorption is rapid via gastrointestinal and respiratory routes, distributed widely across body tissues, including the brain, and primarily metabolized in the liver, producing several active metabolites.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Metamfetamine's actions are mediated through several key targets including neurotransmitter transporters and receptors. It directly interacts with the sodium-dependent dopamine transporter (SLC6A3), serotonin transporter (SLC6A4), and noradrenaline transporter (SLC6A2), enhancing neurotransmitter availability in synaptic clefts. It also affects the synaptic vesicular amine transporter (SLC18A2), chromaffin granule amine transporter (SLC18A1), and various adrenergic receptors (ADRA2A, ADRA2B, ADRA2C). Additionally, it interacts with trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and both isoforms of monoamine oxidase (MAOA and MAOB). Metabolism primarily involves the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6. Transport mechanisms include solute carrier family members SLC22A3 and SLC22A5, though specific roles in pharmacokinetics are less clear.

## Pharmacogenetics
The genetic profile of an individual can influence their response to metamfetamine. Variation in the CYP2D6 enzyme, crucial for drug metabolism, can affect the drugâ€™s effectiveness and likelihood of adverse effects. Individuals with variations that result in poor metabolism may experience higher exposures to metamfetamine, potentially increasing adverse effects and toxicity. Moreover, a polymorphism in the PICK1 gene (rs713729) has been associated with an increased susceptibility to drug-related psychosis and addiction in methamphetamine users. This insight suggests that genetic testing may be valuable in predicting susceptibility to severe side effects and addiction potential, although further studies are needed to better understand and validate these associations.
