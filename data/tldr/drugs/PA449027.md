## Drug Summary
Cladribine, also marketed under the names Litak, Movectro, and Mylinax, is an anticancer medication primarily used in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia, indicated by its efficacy in managing symptoms such as anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or other disease-related symptoms. It additionally serves as an alternative treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Cladribine is a synthetic purine nucleoside analogue. Structurally similar to deoxyadenosine but with a chlorine atom at position 2, it is resistant to degradation by adenosine deaminase, extending its cytotoxic effect against lymphocytes. Its pharmacokinetics include an oral bioavailability of 34 to 48%, and the drug is metabolized into an active triphosphate form, 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine-5'-triphosphate, in cells that possess deoxycytidine kinase.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Cladribine influences several key cellular targets to exert its effects, including the ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase subunits RRM1, RRM2, and RRM2B, which play crucial roles in DNA synthesis. Other targets involve multiple subunits of DNA polymerase such as POLA1, POLE (catalytic subunit A through subunit 4), essential for DNA replication and repair mechanisms. Additionally, cladribine inhibits purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), though its exact impact through this inhibition is unclear. Cladribine's bioavailability and effect are also influenced by cellular transport and metabolism mediated by enzymes such as deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) and transporters including ABCG2 and SLC28A3, which alter the drug's uptake and distribution within cells.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of cladribine are influenced notably by the activity of the enzyme deoxycytidine kinase (DCK), which is pivotal in the activation of cladribine into its triphosphate form that integrates into DNA. Genetic variations in DCK could theoretically affect the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of cladribine, although specific clinical genetic data correlating DCK polymorphisms with cladribine response and toxicity have not been extensively studied in public databases. The transporters ABCG2 and SLC28A3 are involved in drug efflux and nucleoside transport; hence, genetic variations in these transporters could also modulate the distribution and efficacy of cladribine. Given the absence of detailed genomic data from the provided source, these pharmacogenetic interactions remain largely inferential and could be a potential area for further clinical research to optimize treatment outcomes and manage toxicity more effectively.
