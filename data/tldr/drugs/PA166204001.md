## Drug Summary
Zanubrutinib is a second-generation Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of various B-cell malignancies including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and in combination for refractory or relapsed follicular lymphoma. Developed to increase potency and selectivity over first-generation BTK inhibitors such as ibrutinib, zanubrutinib offers reduced off-target effects. It functions as an immunomodulating agent by covalently binding to the active site of BTK, an essential enzyme in B-cell receptor signaling pathways. This binding inhibits various downstream processes critical for the survival and multiplication of malignant B-cells. Zanubrutinib is administered orally and its pharmacokinetics include dose-proportional increases in peak plasma concentration and area under the curve, with a median time to maximum concentration of about 2 hours post-dose. It is primarily metabolized via the CYP3A4 pathway.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Zanubrutinib primarily targets BTK and has fewer, but significant, interactions with other tyrosine kinases like EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB4, and various others including JAK2 and ITK, which contributes to its therapeutic effects and side profile. It's metabolized predominantly by the enzyme CYP3A4, with minor contributions from other CYP3A subfamily enzymes, including CYP2B6, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7. Zanubrutinib's absorption and elimination could be influenced by the P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) transporter, which is crucial for drug bioavailability and distribution. No specific carriers have been noted to be directly associated with Zanubrutinib.

## Pharmacogenetics
The metabolism of Zanubrutinib being predominantly via CYP3A4 implies that genetic variants within the CYP3A4 gene might influence its pharmacokinetics and, consequently, its efficacy and safety profile. For example, individuals carrying CYP3A4*22 alleles may have altered enzyme activity which could impact zanubrutinib's plasma levels and treatment outcomes. The involvement of the ABCB1 transporter suggests that variants in the ABCB1 gene, like the C3435T polymorphism, might influence the drug's distribution and toxicity. Although currently no direct pharmacogenomic guidelines for Zanubrutinib exist, individual variations in these genes should be considered to optimize therapy, particularly in populations known to have differential expression or function of these proteins. Additionally, ongoing research may shed light on the importance of genomic variations impacting the efficacy of kinase inhibitors like zanubrutinib.
