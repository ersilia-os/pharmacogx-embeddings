## Drug Summary
Rifampicin, also known as Rifadine, Rifaldin, Rifoldin, Rimactan, Rimactane, Rofact, and Tubocin, is a semisynthetic antibiotic derived from Streptomyces mediterranei. It is primarily used for treating various forms of tuberculosis, including those resistant to other treatments. As a potent bactericidal agent, rifampicin inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase in bacterial cells, leading to suppression of RNA synthesis and cell death. This antibiotic has a broad antibacterial spectrum, but its use is primarily focused on mycobacterial infections because it quickly leads to resistance if used alone. Rifampicin is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, highly distributed across the body, including the CSF, metabolized mainly in the liver by deacetylation, and excreted through bile.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Rifampicin targets the bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunit beta (rpoB), crucial for RNA synthesis. It also interacts with the nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group I, member 2 (NR1I2) in humans, which plays a role in regulating genes involved in drug metabolism and transport. The metabolism of rifampicin involves several cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A43, CYP3A7, and also UDP-glucuronosyltransferases UGT1A1 and UGT1A9. It influences various transporters such as ABCB1, ABCC1-3, ABCC5, ABCB11, SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, SLCO1A2, SLCO2B1, SLC22A6, SLC22A7, and SLC22A8, which may affect its disposition and the disposal of other concurrently administered drugs. Carriers like ALB (serum albumin) and ORM2 (alpha1-acid glycoprotein) are involved in its systemic circulation.

## Pharmacogenetics
Rifampicin pharmacogenetics reveals significant interactions, particularly involving enzymes responsible for drug metabolism. The induction of CYP3A4 by rifampicin is well-documented, leading to reduced plasma concentrations of co-administered drugs metabolized by this enzyme, such as protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Moreover, the genetic variances in CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 can alter rifampicin's efficacy and safety, impacting individual responses significantly. Polymorphisms in ABCB1 and other drug transporters also potentially modify the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rifampicin, affecting drug absorption and resistance profiles. Genetic testing and personalized medicine approaches may optimize rifampicin therapy by tailoring dosages to achieve maximal efficacy with minimal adverse effects, particularly in multi-drug resistant tuberculosis treatments.
