## Drug Summary
Ritonavir, also known under brand names such as Busvir, Empetus, and Normune, is a protease inhibitor primarily used in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Initially developed to function autonomously as an antiviral, ritonavir has found greater utility as a pharmacokinetic enhancer (booster) for other protease inhibitors. The drug achieves this through potent inhibition of the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme, leading to increased plasma concentrations of co-administered protease inhibitors. Ritonavir is integral to combination regimens for both HIV and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, enhancing the effectiveness of other antivirals. Moreover, ritonavir participates in newly approved combination therapies such as with nirmatrelvir under emergency use for treating COVID-19 in high-risk patients.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Ritonavir functions chiefly by inhibiting the HIV-1 protease, an enzyme necessary for the viral polyprotein's cleavage into functional components, thus preventing the maturation of the virus. Besides the direct inhibition of the HIV-1 protease, ritonavir influences several metabolic pathways through its interaction with numerous enzymes and transporters. It is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6, along with other cytochrome P450 isoenzymes including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP1A2, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7. Additionally, it affects various transporters such as P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and several ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, thereby altering the bioavailability and excretion of co-administered drugs. Ritonavir also interacts with UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) and multiple solute carrier (SLCO) family members, impacting drug disposition.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of ritonavir is significant, predominantly due to its interaction with the CYP450 enzymes. Genetic variations in CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 can influence ritonavir’s metabolism, potentially affecting efficacy and toxicity. For instance, individuals with CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status might experience altered pharmacokinetics of ritonavir. Additionally, genetic differences in transporter genes like ABCB1 could modify the drug’s distribution and elimination, impacting therapeutic outcomes and adverse effects. While extensive pharmacogenetic data specifically for ritonavir may be limited, inferences about its interactions can be drawn from studies on CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 variant alleles. These interactions underscore the importance of considering genetic makeup when prescribing ritonavir-containing regimens, particularly in polypharmacy scenarios prevalent in HIV and HCV treatment protocols.
