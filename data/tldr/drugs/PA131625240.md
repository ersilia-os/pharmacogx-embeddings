## Drug Summary
Raltitrexed, marketed under the brand name TomudexÂ®, is a chemotherapy medication primarily used for the treatment of malignant neoplasms of the colon and rectum. It belongs to the class of antimetabolites and functions as a folic acid antagonist. Pharmacodynamically, Raltitrexed inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), an enzyme essential for DNA synthesis, leading to the disruption of DNA replication and subsequent cell death in cancer cells. It is noteworthy that Raltitrexed affects the growth of both cancerous and normal cells, which may result in side effects such as hair loss, myelosuppression, and gastrointestinal disturbances. The drug is transported into cells via the reduced folate carrier and is extensively polyglutamated once inside, which enhances its inhibitory effect on thymidylate synthase and duration of action.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary target of Raltitrexed is thymidylate synthase (TYMS), a crucial enzyme involved in the synthesis of thymidine triphosphate (TTP), a nucleotide required for DNA synthesis. The drug's action leads to decreased TTP levels, culminating in DNA fragmentation and cell death. Additionally, Raltitrexed is modified within the cell by folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS), an enzyme that converts it into its polyglutamate forms, enhancing its activity and retention in cells. There are no specific enzymes, transporters, or carriers listed other than the reduced folate carrier, which mediates the cell entry of Raltitrexed, and FPGS, which facilitates its intracellular metabolism.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there is no specific pharmacogenetic data available for Raltitrexed in the provided DrugBank information. However, given that TYMS is its primary target, genetic variations in the TYMS gene might hypothetically influence the drug's efficacy and toxicity. Polymorphisms in the TYMS gene can affect enzyme expression and function, potentially altering the response to Raltitrexed. For example, certain TYMS polymorphisms have been associated with altered enzyme levels and could hypothetically impact the therapeutic outcomes of therapies involving TYMS inhibition. Similarly, variations in genes encoding the reduced folate carrier might influence the cellular uptake of the drug. While these associations are inferential and require further clinical validation, they represent possible areas of interest for pharmacogenetic research regarding Raltitrexed.
