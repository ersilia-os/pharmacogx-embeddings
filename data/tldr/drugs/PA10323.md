## Drug Summary
Tryptophan, also known as Alti-Tryptophan, is classified as an essential amino acid critical for various physiological processes. It is utilized in both nutritional supplementation and therapeutic contexts. Tryptophan is a vital precursor for the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitters serotonin and melatonin, contributing to its role in regulating mood, sleep, and cognition. It is also involved in the synthesis of niacin (vitamin B3), although this pathway is generally inefficient in mammals. Tryptophan's pharmacodynamics highlight its utility in promoting healthy sleep, managing depression, pain tolerance, and potential effects on weight management. Metabolism of tryptophan primarily occurs in the liver through complex pathways involving various metabolites that have significant biological activities, including kynurenine and its derivatives.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Tryptophan interacts with several enzymatic targets crucial for its metabolic pathways. Key human enzymes include Tryptophan 5-hydroxylase 1 and 2 (TPH1, TPH2) which are involved in converting tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan, a precursor to serotonin. Tryptophan--tRNA ligase, both cytoplasmic (WARS) and mitochondrial (WARS2), are essential for protein synthesis. Tryptophan is also a substrate for Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2), initiating the kynurenine pathway, which has multiple physiological roles. Transport of tryptophan across cell membranes involves monocarboxylate transporters such as SLC16A2 and SLC16A10, facilitating its cellular uptake.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspect of tryptophan metabolism primarily involves its conversion through the serotonin and kynurenine pathways, influenced by genetic variations in enzymes like TPH1, TPH2, IDO1, and TDO2. Variants in these genes can affect individual responses to tryptophan supplementation, impacting serotonin production, and consequently mood and sleep patterns. Polymorphisms in the genes encoding serotonin transporter and receptors may further modulate the therapeutic effects of tryptophan on depression and other psychiatric conditions. Additionally, the interaction of tryptophan metabolism with immune system pathways through IDO1 highlights a pharmacogenetic intersection affecting immune response and inflammation, relevant in autoimmune disorders and cancer.
