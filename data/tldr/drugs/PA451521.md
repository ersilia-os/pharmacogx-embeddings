## Drug Summary
Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is primarily used as a chelating agent in the treatment of metal poisoning, particularly lead, mercury, and arsenic. Its chemical structure, featuring two sulfhydryl groups, allows it to bind to heavy metals, facilitating their excretion from the body. While substantial information from formal databases such as DrugBank may be lacking on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics details, clinical usage suggests that DMSA is generally well-absorbed and excreted primarily in the urine. Its efficiency in removing heavy metals from the bloodstream has positioned it as an essential drug in toxicology.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
As a chelating agent, the primary action of dimercaptosuccinic acid is to form stable complexes with heavy metals, which can then be excreted. This action is more physical-chemical in nature rather than involving specific biological targets like enzymes or receptors. Since detailed information on its interaction with specific enzymes, transporters, or carriers is not provided in the DrugBank entry and generally not emphasized in literature, it is predominantly understood through its chelation properties rather than interactions with biological molecules.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is limited specific information on pharmacogenetic associations with the use of dimercaptosuccinic acid. Given its role as a chelating agent, the pharmacogenetics would likely revolve around variations in genes related to its absorption, metabolism, or excretion rather than direct drug-gene interactions affecting efficacy or toxicity. Studies specifically investigating these aspects are sparse, implying a need for additional research to identify any significant pharmacogenetic factors that may influence the therapy outcomes with DMSA in different individuals.
