## Drug Summary
Sevoflurane, marketed under brand names such as Sevorane and Ultane, is a volatile, non-flammable ether inhalation anesthetic agent primarily used to induce and maintain general anesthesia in both adult and pediatric patients. It enjoys widespread use due to its lower solubility in blood, which facilitates a rapid onset and quick recovery from anesthesia â€“ characteristics that are particularly advantageous in outpatient surgery settings. Approved by the FDA in 1996, sevoflurane has a favorable safety profile, characterized by a low risk of airway irritation and relatively mild hemodynamic effects. However, it's not entirely without risks; potential adverse effects include renal injury, QT prolongation, and association with malignant hyperthermia especially in susceptible individuals.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Sevoflurane acts primarily by modulating the activity of central nervous system neurotransmitters through its effects on various ion channels and receptors. Its mechanism involves enhancing inhibitory neurotransmission via agonism at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (including several subunits like GABRA1, GABRA2, etc.) and glycine receptors, while inhibiting excitatory neurotransmission through effects on ion channels like glutamate and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In terms of metabolism, sevoflurane is predominantly handled by the liver enzyme CYP2E1, with minor contributions from CYP2B6, CYP2A6, and CYP3A4, producing metabolites such as hexafluoroisopropanol which are subsequently conjugated and excreted. The drug is poorly bound to plasma proteins, but it does interact with albumin to some extent.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of sevoflurane is not extensively detailed in literature compared to some other medications, likely due to its largely inhalational and exhalational elimination route minimizing common pharmacogenetic interactions seen with drugs that undergo extensive metabolic processing. However, variations in genes encoding the metabolizing enzymes, particularly CYP2E1, could influence individual responses to sevoflurane, affecting both the rate of metabolism and the potential for toxicity such as fluoride ion release which can impact renal function. Additionally, genetic variability in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors might influence the depth and duration of anesthesia, although specific alleles and their clinical significances remain to be fully elucidated. These areas represent potential avenues for further pharmacogenetic research, which could refine the personalized use of sevoflurane in anesthesia.
