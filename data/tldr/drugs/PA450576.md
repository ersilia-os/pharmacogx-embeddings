## Drug Summary
Nafcillin, commercially known as Nallpen or Unipen, is a semi-synthetic antibiotic that belongs to the beta-lactam class of antibiotics. It is closely related to penicillin and is specifically formulated to be resistant to beta-lactamase enzymes produced by certain staphylococci. Nafcillin is primarily indicated for infections caused by penicillinase-producing strains of Staphylococcus species that are susceptible to the drug, notably excluding Methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA). Nafcillin exhibits bactericidal activity, which is exerted via inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis during active multiplication by forming covalent bonds with penicillin-binding proteins. The absorption of nafcillin reveals that peak plasma concentrations are attained just minutes after intravenous administration. Metabolism of nafcillin occurs in the liver, though it accounts for less than 30% of the drug's biotransformation. 

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Nafcillin acts primarily through the inhibition of key penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) found in *Streptococcus pneumoniae*. These proteins, including PBP1b, PBP1a, PBP2a, PBP2b, and PBP3, are critical for bacterial cell wall synthesis. By targeting these proteins, nafcillin disrupts the final stages of bacterial cell wall assembly, leading to cell lysis. Furthermore, the drug is metabolized by human liver enzymes CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, although this accounts for only a minor portion of its overall metabolism. There is also interaction with human transporters such as SLC22A6, which affects its renal handling, and it is carried in the blood bound to albumin (ALB).

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of nafcillin specifically involves interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, which have individual variability based on genetic makeup. Genetic polymorphisms in these enzymes can lead to variations in drug metabolism rates among different individuals, potentially affecting drug efficacy and toxicity. However, detailed pharmacogenetic data specifically tailoring nafcillin dose based on these genetic differences is not extensively documented. Research in this area could help optimize nafcillin dosing, minimizing toxicity while enhancing therapeutic outcomes in treating susceptible staphylococcal infections.
