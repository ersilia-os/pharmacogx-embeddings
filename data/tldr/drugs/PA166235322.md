## Drug Summary
Risdiplam is an innovative oral medication indicated for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), specifically approved by the FDA in August 2020. It operates as an mRNA splicing modifier, targeting the _SMN2_ gene to increase the inclusion of exon 7 during splicing, thus boosting the production of functional survival motor neuron (SMN) proteins. SMA is characterized by genetic mutations in the _SMN1_ gene leading to deficient SMN protein production, essential for motor neuron survival and function. Risdiplam enhances these protein levels, critical in alleviating the symptoms of SMA. Its oral administration offers a more convenient alternative to other therapies such as nusinersen, which requires intrathecal delivery. The pharmacokinetics of risdiplam reveal a linear relationship across studied doses with a Tmax of 1-4 hours and steady-state achievement between 7-14 days when dosed daily with food.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Risdiplam does not specifically bind to conventional drug targets like receptors or enzymes; instead, it interacts directly with _SMN2_ pre-mRNA to modulate splicing. However, its metabolism involves several enzymes predominantly including flavin monooxygenases (FMO1 and FMO3) and several cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A1, CYP2J2, CYP3A4, CYP3A7). Metabolite M1, a pharmacologically inactive byproduct, has been observed to inhibit MATE1 and MATE2-K transporters. Also, risdiplam and its metabolites interact with transporters such as SLC47A1 (MATE1), SLC47A2 (MATE2-K), ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), and ABCG2. These interactions might influence the drug's pharmacokinetics and dynamics. Albumin (ALB) serves as a carrier, potentially influencing the distribution of risdiplam within the body.

## Pharmacogenetics
As a splicing modifier, risdiplamâ€™s efficacy hinges on its interaction with the _SMN2_ gene transcript, specifically enhancing the inclusion of exon 7 to produce functional SMN protein. Although there is no detailed association provided in the DrugBank entry regarding direct genomic implications, genetic variations within the _SMN2_ copy number, and potentially the splicing machinery, could impact treatment outcomes with risdiplam. Variabilities in the genes encoding FMOs and CYPs involved in its metabolism may also affect the pharmacokinetics and overall response to the drug. Further research and clinical data might reveal more about these pharmacogenetic associations, offering insights into personalized dosing regimens or risk mitigation strategies related to adverse effects or reduced efficacy in certain patient subgroups.
