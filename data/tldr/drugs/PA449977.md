## Drug Summary
Indinavir, marketed under the brand name Crixivan, is an antiretroviral medication used for the treatment of HIV infection. It belongs to the therapeutic class of protease inhibitors which target the protease enzyme of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Indinavir works by binding to the protease active site, inhibiting its activity which is crucial for the viral replication process. This leads to the production of immature, non-infectious viral particles. It is known for its good oral bioavailability and is typically used in combination with other antiretroviral agents to enhance efficacy. The drug undergoes rapid absorption and is metabolized primarily by hepatic enzymes, mainly through cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4).

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Indinavir specifically inhibits the HIV-1 protease, an enzyme required for the viral polyprotein cleavage into functional proteins necessary for the virus's infectivity. Key enzymes involved in its metabolism include CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, CYP2D6, and UGT1A1. These enzymes are responsible for oxidative and glucuronide conjugation metabolites of indinavir. It influences several transporters, including ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), which affects drug efflux and absorption across membranes, and several solute carriers such as SLCO1A2, SLCO1B1, and SLCO2B1, which assist in hepatic and possibly other tissue uptakes. Transporters such as ABCC1, ABCC2, and ABCB11 are also involved, which handle various aspects of drug and metabolite transport and may play roles in the excretion and toxicity profiles of indinavir.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetics play a significant role in the effectiveness and safety profile of indinavir. The metabolism of indinavir is predominantly mediated by CYP3A4, and genetic variations in this enzyme can affect the drug's plasma concentrations, potentially leading to variations in efficacy or risk of toxicity. Individuals with polymorphisms in CYP3A5 may also experience differences in drug metabolism. Furthermore, genetic variations in transporters like ABCB1 could alter the drug's distribution and excretion, impacting its therapeutic effectiveness and adverse effect profile. However, specific pharmacogenetic testing guidelines or recommendations for indinavir are not well-established and are generally inferred based on studies of the enzyme and transporter gene impacts on other similar protease inhibitors. These genetic factors are crucial considerations for personalized medicine and therapy optimization in HIV treatment.
