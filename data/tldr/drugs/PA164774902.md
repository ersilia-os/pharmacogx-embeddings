## Drug Summary
Tolazamide is a sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agent, used primarily to manage non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (Type II diabetes) as an adjunct to diet when diet alone is insufficient for controlling blood glucose levels. Tolazamide functions by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an action that depends on functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets. It demonstrates a rapid and robust absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Over time, some patients may grow less responsive to tolazamide, requiring adjustments in therapy or a switch to other drugs. Tolazamide is subject to metabolic breakdown, producing several metabolites with varying degrees of hypoglycemic activity, from 0 to 70%. Its use can be associated with severe hypoglycemic episodes in the case of overdosage, which necessitates immediate medical intervention.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Tolazamide primarily acts by binding to ATP-sensitive potassium-channel receptors, specifically the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (ABCC8) and the inwardly-rectifying potassium channel, Kir6.2 (KCNJ11), on pancreatic beta-cell surfaces. This action reduces potassium conductance, leading to cell membrane depolarization, which in turn stimulates calcium ion influx through voltage-sensitive channels. The increase in intracellular calcium facilitates the exocytosis and subsequent secretion of insulin. Tolazamide is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme, specifically CYP2C9, which is crucial for its clearance from the body. There are no significant interactions via transporters or carriers mentioned for this drug.

## Pharmacogenetics
While direct pharmacogenetic data specific to tolazamide was not provided, information can be inferred based on its metabolic pathway and drug class. CYP2C9 is known to have genetic polymorphisms that can affect the metabolism of sulfonylureas. Variants such as CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 result in reduced enzymatic activity, potentially leading to higher plasma levels of tolazamide, thereby increasing the risk of hypoglycemia in patients carrying these alleles. Patients with these variants might require dose adjustments or careful monitoring to mitigate the risk of severe hypoglycemic events. Further pharmacogenetic research could illuminate additional genetic factors influencing the efficacy and safety of tolazamide, especially pertaining to inter-individual variability in drug response.
