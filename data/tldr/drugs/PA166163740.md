## Drug Summary
Apixaban, marketed under the brand name Eliquis, is an oral anticoagulant that belongs to the class of direct factor Xa inhibitors. It is specifically designed to prevent and treat thromboembolic diseases such as stroke, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). Apixaban operates by selectively inhibiting both free and bound forms of factor Xa, as well as prothrombinase, independent of antithrombin III. This mechanism of action helps to prevent thrombus formation. Apixaban was approved by the FDA in December 2012 and has a bioavailability of approximately 50%. It is excreted partly as unchanged drug and partly as metabolites, with roughly 25% of the dose appearing as O-demethyl apixaban sulfate.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Apixaban primarily targets coagulation factor X (F10), effectively inhibiting its activity, which is crucial in the coagulation cascade to prevent thrombosis. The drug is metabolized mainly by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, including CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2J2, and to a lesser extent by CYP3A5. These enzymes play significant roles in the metabolism of apixaban, influencing its plasma levels and therapeutic effects. Apixaban is also a substrate for the transporters ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1) and ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2), which affect its absorption and secretion.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of apixaban involve interactions with enzymes and transporters that are influenced by genetic variations. Polymorphisms in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 can alter the metabolism of apixaban, potentially affecting its efficacy and safety. Similarly, genetic variants in ABCB1 and ABCG2 may impact the drug's pharmacokinetics by influencing its absorption and excretion. While comprehensive clinical guidelines on genotype-based dosing for apixaban are not fully established, these genetic factors are considered when evaluating the risk of bleeding or thrombosis in individual patients. Variations in these genes could potentially guide personalized dosing strategies to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects.
