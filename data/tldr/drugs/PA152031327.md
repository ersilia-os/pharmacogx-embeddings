## Drug Summary
Geldanamycin is an ansamycin antibiotic that was first isolated from the bacterium *Streptomyces hygroscopicus*. It exhibits potent antitumor properties primarily due to its ability to bind to Heat Shock Proteins 90 (HSP90), which are molecular chaperone proteins crucial for the functional stability of several key proteins that drive growth and survival of cancer cells. Geldanamycin acts by inhibiting the protein folding activity of HSP90, leading to the degradation of its client proteins. The drug was an early prototype in the development of HSP90 inhibitors, which are under investigation for cancer therapy. The actual pharmacokinetic properties of geldanamycin including absorption, metabolism, and its route of excretion are not well established in publicly available databases.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Geldanamycin targets multiple isoforms of Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90). It interacts primarily with HSP90B1 (endoplasmin), which functions mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum, and HSP90AA1 and HSP90AB1, which are the cytosolic forms known respectively as heat shock protein HSP 90-alpha and 90-beta. These interactions disrupt the function of HSP90, leading to the degradation of several client proteins important in tumor growth and survival. There are no specific enzymes, transporters, or carriers detailed in the DrugBank information provided for geldanamycin.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there is limited specific pharmacogenetic data available for geldanamycin. However, the pharmacogenetics of HSP90 inhibitors, in general, focuses on the variability in treatment responses based on genetic differences in HSP90 client proteins or proteins in related pathways that impact drug efficacy and toxicity. Studies generally would involve looking at genetic variations in cancer-related genes which are client proteins of HSP90 and their impact on the pharmacodynamics of geldanamycin. Further research could reveal specific genetic markers that could predict responsiveness or adverse reactions to geldanamycin therapy, enhancing personalized treatment approaches in oncology.
