## Drug Summary
Acamprosate, marketed under the brand names Campral and Regtect, is a medication specifically used to maintain abstinence in patients with alcohol dependence after undergoing detoxification. As a structural analogue of the neurotransmitter Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA), acamprosate modifies the neural activities disrupted by chronic alcohol exposure. The drug was first approved by the FDA in 2004. It operates predominantly in the central nervous system (CNS), helping to restore the balance between excitation and inhibition in the neurons. The pharmacodynamics involve likely interactions with NMDA receptors and calcium channels, aiding in reducing alcohol intake and maintaining abstinence. Acamprosate has an absorption rate in the gastrointestinal tract with about 11% bioavailability, reaching steady-state concentrations within 5 to 7 days.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Acamprosate primarily targets the glutamate (NMDA) receptor subunits GRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN2C, GRIN2D, GRIN3A, and GRIN3B, and the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (GRM5). It has been suggested to bind and inhibit the Gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 1 (GABBR1) while having indirect effects on GABA A receptors. This interaction indicates a broad mechanism where acamprosate affects both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission pathways pivotal in alcohol dependence. The drug's primary transporter involved in its pharmacokinetics is the solute carrier family 22 member 6 (SLC22A6). Acamprosate is not metabolized by enzymes and therefore lacks metabolizers that could affect its pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
While the DrugBank entry does not provide specific genomic data related to acamprosate, the drug's target on NMDA and GABA receptors suggests possible pharmacogenetic implications worth exploring. Variations in genes encoding components of the glutamate pathway or GABAergic systems (like GRIN or GABBR genes) could hypothetically influence the response to acamprosate. However, these interactions are speculative as there is no direct clinical data linking genetic variations with the efficacy or toxicity of acamprosate in the summary provided. Existing literature does not robustly establish genetic associations but understanding potential genomic impacts on the pharmacodynamics of acamprosate could enhance personalized treatment approaches in alcohol dependence management.
