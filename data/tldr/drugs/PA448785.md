## Drug Summary
Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing drug primarily used for the treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain, particularly trigeminal neuralgia. It is also employed to manage bipolar disorder, specifically for controlling manic episodes. Approved by the FDA in 1965, carbamazepine acts by inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels which helps in reducing neuronal excitability and thus preventing seizure activity. Its efficacy extends to various types of epileptic seizures such as mixed, partial with complex symptoms, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Additionally, carbamazepine has been utilized off-label for conditions like alcohol withdrawal syndrome and restless leg syndrome. This drug exhibits a narrow therapeutic index and undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism predominantly via the CYP3A4 enzyme, creating an active metabolite, carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Carbamazepine targets multiple voltage-gated sodium channel alpha subunits including SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN3A, SCN8A, and several others, thereby modulating neuronal excitability and threshold for firing. It also interacts with the neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-4 (CHRNA4) and nuclear receptor NR1I2. Metabolically, it is primarily metabolized by hepatic enzymes such as CYP3A4, along with contributions from CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, and CYP3A5. Besides, CYP1A2, UGT2B7, and other UGT enzymes participate in its metabolism. Carbamazepine is known to induce its own metabolism via enzyme induction, which may cause variations in drug levels. Moreover, it interacts with transporters like P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1) and canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter 1 (ABCC2), affecting its pharmacokinetic profile.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors significantly influence the response and adverse reactions to carbamazepine. In particular, the presence of HLA-B*1502 allele in individuals of Han Chinese, Taiwanese, and other Asian descent is associated with a markedly increased risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Other alleles including HLA-A*3101 have also been linked to hypersensitivity reactions in various populations. Additionally, variability in SCN1A gene affects the drugâ€™s efficacy in controlling epileptic seizures. Carbamazepine metabolism can be affected by polymorphisms in CYP3A4 and CYP2C8, impacting drug levels and response. Given these associations, genetic testing prior to therapy initiation is recommended in certain populations to mitigate the risk of severe adverse reactions and to tailor therapeutic strategies effectively.
