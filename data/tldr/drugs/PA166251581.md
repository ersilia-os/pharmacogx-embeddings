## Drug Summary

Viloxazine, sold under the brand names Emovit and Qelbree, is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) primarily indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults and children aged 6 years and older. Initially launched as an antidepressant in Europe in 1974, viloxazine has more recently been repurposed for ADHD management. It operates by increasing norepinephrine and serotonin neurotransmitter activity in the brain, contributing to its therapeutic effects. Despite its stimulant-like actions, viloxazine is noted for not causing drug dependency or abuse. The drug is orally administered, with rapid absorption, and reaches steady state in the blood after two days of administration. After ingestion, viloxazine is metabolized primarily via the CYP2D6 pathway, forming various metabolites.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers

Viloxazine interacts with multiple targets crucial for its mechanism of action. It inhibits the norepinephrine transporter (SLC6A2) which enhances the level of norepinephrine. It also antagonizes the 5-HT_2B receptor and activates the 5-HT_2C receptor, which potentially enhances serotonin activity while modulating dopaminergic transmission, particularly in brain areas related to ADHD. Other interactions include modulation of various adrenergic and muscarinic receptors (e.g., ADRA1B, ADRB2, HRH1, HRH2, CHRM1-4), potentially contributing to its broader CNS effects. The drug's enzymes include CYP2D6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B15, pivotal in its metabolic pathway to produce the major metabolite detected in plasma. Transport-wise, viloxazine is a substrate for the SLC47A1 transporter, affecting its excretion.

## Pharmacogenetics

Viloxazine's metabolization by CYP2D6 plays a crucial role in its pharmacokinetics. Variation in the CYP2D6 gene can lead to different metabolic rates among individuals, which might influence the drug's efficacy and safety profile. For example, individuals with reduced CYP2D6 activity (poor metabolizers) could have higher concentrations of viloxazine, leading to increased exposure and potentially more side effects or heightened therapeutic effect. Conversely, rapid metabolizers might require higher doses to achieve therapeutic levels. Such pharmacogenetic factors are key considerations in personalized medicine, guiding dose adjustments based on genetic makeup to optimize therapy and minimize adverse effects, though specific guidelines in clinical practice for viloxazine are yet to be fully established based on these genetic differences.
