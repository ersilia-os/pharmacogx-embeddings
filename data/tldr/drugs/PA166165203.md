## Drug Summary
Carfilzomib is an injectable proteasome inhibitor used primarily in the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Approved by the FDA in July 2012, it is chemically a modified tetrapeptidyl epoxide and an analog of epoxomicin. Carfilzomib acts by irreversibly binding to the N-terminal threonine-containing active sites of the 20S proteasome, particularly inhibiting the chymotrypsin-like activity which leads to reduced cellular proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis of cancer cells. The drug exhibits dose-dependent pharmacokinetics with a rapid and extensive metabolism predominantly in the liver through peptidase cleavage and epoxide hydrolysis, involving minimal action of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Carfilzomib's common adverse effects include fatigue, anemia, nausea, and thrombocytopenia, with thrombocytopenia and febrile neutropenia recognized as dose-limiting toxicities.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Carfilzomib specifically targets various subunits of the proteasome which include PSMB5, PSMB8, PSMB1, PSMB9, PSMB2, and PSMB10. These subunits form part of the 20S core of the 26S proteasome and are crucial for its proteolytic functions. Carfilzomib's inhibition of these subunits disrupts the regulated degradation of proteins involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis, which is critical in cancer therapy. The drug is also known to interact with transporters such as ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), where its up-regulation has been proposed as a potential mechanism of resistance to carfilzomib therapy, although this is not fully confirmed.

## Pharmacogenetics
As of now, detailed pharmacogenetic data specific to carfilzomib are limited. The involvement of ABCB1 in resistance mechanisms suggests a pharmacogenetic angle, where genetic variants in the ABCB1 gene could potentially influence the drug's efficacy and patient's response to treatment. Generally, polymorphisms in genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters could affect drug disposition and toxicity profiles. However, given that cytochrome P450 enzymes are minimally involved in carfilzomib's metabolism, the impact of pharmacogenetics might be more pronounced in its pharmacodynamics and interactions with transport proteins, rather than its metabolic pathways. Further studies and clinical trials would be beneficial to elucidate more concrete pharmacogenetic relationships for carfilzomib.
