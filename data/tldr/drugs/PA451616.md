## Drug Summary
Terbutaline, known under various brand names including Brethaire, Brethine, Bricanyl, and others, is a selective beta-2 adrenergic agonist primarily used as a bronchodilator. Synthesized in 1966 and FDA approved in 1974, terbutaline treats reversible bronchospasm associated with asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema in patients aged 12 and older. It functions by stimulating beta-2 adrenergic receptors, enhancing bronchial muscle relaxation and airflow. Terbutalineâ€™s pharmacokinetics reveal that it is quickly absorbed with a peak concentration following subcutaneous administration in about 0.5 hours. Oral bioavailability is low (approx. 14-15%), and the drug is metabolized predominantly through sulfation and glucuronidation pathways before elimination.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Terbutaline targets the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) most significantly, enhancing cyclic AMP levels in bronchial smooth muscle cells to promote relaxation and bronchodilation. Though less significant, it can also interact with beta-3 (ADRB3) and beta-1 (ADRB1) adrenergic receptors. Metabolic clearance of terbutaline involves various sulfotransferase enzymes (like SULT2A1, SULT1A1, and others) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), which include UGT1A1, UGT1A4, and others. These enzymes play key roles in conjugating terbutaline into more water-soluble forms for renal and biliary excretion. The drug is also transported by solute carrier proteins SLC22A5 and SLC22A2, affecting its cellular uptake and distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
Genetic variability in the enzymes responsible for terbutaline metabolism, particularly the sulfotransferases and UGTs, can influence both the therapeutic effects and side effect profiles of the drug. For instance, polymorphisms in genes encoding these enzymes could modulate drug levels, potentially altering efficacy and toxicity. Although specific pharmacogenetic guidelines for terbutaline prescribing based on these genetic variations are not well-established, studies might reveal significant influences. For example, variations in SULT1A1 or UGT1A1 could hypothetically affect the sulfation and glucuronidation processes, respectively, altering drug metabolism speeds and might necessitate dosage adjustments in certain populations. Continual research in this area is vital for personalized medicine approaches in asthmatic treatment using terbutaline.
