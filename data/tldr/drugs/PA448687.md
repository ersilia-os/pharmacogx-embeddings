## Drug Summary
Bupropion, marketed under various brand names such as Wellbutrin®, Elontril, Forfivo, Prexaton, and Voxra, is a norepinephrine/dopamine-reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) primarily used to treat Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), and as an aid for smoking cessation. Unique among antidepressants, bupropion lacks serotonergic, histamine, or adrenaline receptor activity, which contributes to its minimal sexual side effects, absence of sedation, and lack of weight gain, making it a favorable option compared to SSRIs or TCAs. Additionally, bupropion is used off-label for ADHD in adults with bipolar disorder to minimize mood destabilization risk and as a component of the product Contrave® (alongside naltrexone) for chronic weight management in adults. 

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Bupropion acts by inhibiting the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and the dopamine transporter (DAT), reducing the reuptake of these neurotransmitters and prolonging their action in the synapse. The drug also interacts with the neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-3 (CHRNA3) and the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3A (HTR3A). Metabolism of bupropion is predominantly facilitated by CYP2B6, with additional involvement from CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. Moreover, bupropion and its metabolites interact with transporters and carriers including the solute carrier family 22 member 2 (SLC22A2) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1). 

## Pharmacogenetics
The genetic profile of an individual can affect their response to bupropion. A notable pharmacogenetic aspect of bupropion involves the CYP2B6 enzyme, where genetic variants can influence the drug's metabolism and efficacy. The variant allele CYP2B6*6, associated with reduced enzyme activity, could potentially lead to higher plasma levels of bupropion, affecting both efficacy and toxicity. Furthermore, the presence of a specific allele in the dopamine receptor D2 gene (DRD2), denoted by the rs1800497 genotype, has been linked to an improved therapeutic response to bupropion. This suggests variations in DRD2 might influence the clinical outcome of bupropion therapy, particularly in depression and smoking cessation contexts.
