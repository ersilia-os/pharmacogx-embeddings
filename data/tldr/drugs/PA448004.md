## Drug Summary
Abacavir is a nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) used primarily to treat HIV-1 infection. As a synthetic carbocyclic nucleoside, it exhibits its antiretroviral effects by interfering with viral DNA synthesis. Abacavir is notably effective when combined with other antiretroviral drugs, such as dolutegravir and lamivudine, proving beneficial in both adult and pediatric patients who weigh more than 10 kg. This drug is rapidly and extensively absorbed after oral administration, with an 83% bioavailability when taken as a tablet. Its metabolism primarily occurs in the liver, facilitated by alcohol dehydrogenase and glucuronyltransferase, leading to metabolites that lack antiviral activity. While abacavir does not significantly undergo metabolism via cytochrome P450 enzymes, its pharmacokinetics can be influenced by various factors including the presence of specific genetic polymorphisms.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Abacavir targets the reverse transcriptase enzyme of HIV-1, inhibiting viral replication by interfering with viral DNA chain elongation. The active metabolite of abacavir, carbovir triphosphate, competes with the natural substrate and once incorporated into viral DNA, prevents its elongation due to absence of a 3'-OH group. Enzymatically, abacavir is processed by adenosine kinase (ADK), alcohol dehydrogenase 6 (ADH6), and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-1 (UGT1A1), which are involved in its metabolic breakdown into non-active forms. There are no significant interactions of abacavir with drug transporters or carriers listed, focusing the metabolic interactions predominantly within hepatic pathways.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of abacavir is highly significant, with serious hypersensitivity reactions associated with the presence of the HLA-B*57:01 allele. This linkage has been a critical discovery, leading to the recommendation that patients be screened for this allele before initiating abacavir treatment. The adverse hypersensitivity reactions, which can manifest within the first 6 weeks of treatment, underscore the importance of genetic testing in personalized medicine. Another genetic association is with the HCP5 gene, where the SNP rs2395029 significantly increases the risk of hypersensitivity reactions to abacavir. These pharmacogenetic insights are crucial for enhancing drug safety and efficacy, highlighting the sophisticated interplay between genetic factors and drug response.
