## Drug Summary
Valganciclovir, also known under brand names such as Cymeval and Valcyt, is an antiviral medication primarily used for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. It functions as the L-valyl ester prodrug of ganciclovir. Following oral administration, valganciclovir is rapidly converted into ganciclovir by intestinal and hepatic esterases. Ganciclovir, the active form, is an analogue of guanosine and integrates into viral DNA, leading to premature termination of DNA replication. Therefore, it inhibits the elongation of viral DNA, an essential process for viral replication. The drug is notable for its good absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, with an absolute bioavailability of about 60% when ingested with food. It is specifically hydrolyzed to ganciclovir without the formation of other metabolites.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Valganciclovir does not have direct targets since it is a prodrug. Its active metabolite, ganciclovir, targets viral processes. Specifically, in CMV-infected cells, it interferes with viral protein kinases and DNA polymerasesâ€”an action critical to its virustatic activity. In terms of transport, Valganciclovir uses solute carriers such as SLC15A1 and SLC15A2, which are peptide transporters, and SLC6A14, a neutral and basic amino acid transporter. These transporters likely facilitate the cellular uptake of the drug, enhancing its bioavailability and efficacy.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there are limited specific genomic data or known pharmacogenetic interactions explicitly linked to the efficacy or toxicity of valganciclovir provided by the DrugBank database. However, the drug's transformation into ganciclovir by hepatic and intestinal esterases suggests that variations in these esterase enzymes could potentially affect the drug's pharmacokinetics and overall effectiveness. Further, since transporters such as SLC15A1, SLC15A2, and SLC6A14 are involved in its absorption and distribution, genetic variants in these transporter genes might influence the therapeutic outcomes or side effects experienced by individual patients. Understanding these genomic influences can be crucial for customizing treatments and dosing to achieve optimal results while minimizing adverse effects.
