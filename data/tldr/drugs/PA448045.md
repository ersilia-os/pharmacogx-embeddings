## Drug Summary
Acyclovir, also known as Zovir, is a nucleoside analog antiviral agent primarily used for the treatment of herpes simplex virus infections, Varicella zoster (chickenpox and shingles), and acute herpetic keratitis. It has been a staple in antiviral therapy since its FDA approval in 1982. The drug functions by inhibiting viral DNA polymerase, essential for DNA replication in the virus. Acyclovir is activated within the infected cells by the viral enzyme thymidine kinase and subsequently converted through several steps to acyclovir triphosphate, which directly inhibits viral DNA replication. Its pharmacokinetic profile includes low oral bioavailability (10-20%), minimal systemic absorption from topical applications, and metabolism primarily within infected cells. Notably, acyclovir’s metabolism involves less than 15% oxidation by human enzymes and mainly relies on conversion by viral and host cell enzymes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary targets of acyclovir are the DNA polymerase catalytic subunits of herpesviruses, essential for viral replication. Acyclovir’s activation and subsequent conversions involve various enzymes: initially activated by the viral enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) from HHV-1, and then further processed by cellular enzymes such as guanylate kinase (GUK1) and a series of kinases including nucleoside diphosphokinase (NME1, NME2), pyruvate kinase (PKLR, PKM), creatine kinase (CKB, CKM, CKMT2, CKMT1A), and others involved in cellular energy metabolism. Several transporters and carriers aid the cellular handling of acyclovir, including members of the solute carrier family (SLC22A1, SLC22A6, SLC22A8) and the albumin protein (ALB), which may impact its distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of acyclovir are primarily influenced by variations in the viral thymidine kinase and potentially the human enzymes involved in its phosphorylation pathway. Host genetic variations in these enzymes could affect drug efficacy and safety, although specific genetic biomarkers have not been extensively validated for routine clinical use. Differences in transporter genes, such as those in the solute carrier family, might also influence acyclovir’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, affecting drug levels and response variability among patients. Further research could better delineate these relationships to enhance personalized treatment approaches for viral infections managed with acyclovir.
