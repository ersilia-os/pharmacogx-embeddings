## Drug Summary
Mitomycin, also known as Mitozytrex, is an antineoplastic antibiotic derived from _Streptomyces caespitosus_. It acts primarily as an alkylating agent, disrupting DNA synthesis by cross-linking DNA strands, and at higher concentrations, can also inhibit RNA and protein synthesis. Due to these properties, Mitomycin is effective in treating several types of cancers including malignancies of the lip, oral cavity, pharynx, digestive organs, peritoneum, female breast, and urinary bladder. It is uniquely important in treating low-grade Upper Tract Urothelial Cancer (LG-UTUC) and is also used adjunctively in _ab externo_ glaucoma surgery. Its absorption is reported as erratic, and metabolism primarily occurs in the liver with some in various other tissues. Toxicity can lead to symptoms like nausea and vomiting, particularly at overdose levels.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Mitomycin does not have specific drug target information available, possibly reflecting its broad and somewhat non-specific mechanism of action through DNA cross-linking. Its activation and subsequent effects involve the enzymes, specifically NADPH--cytochrome P450 reductase (POR), which is crucial for its reductive activation in vivo. This enzyme facilitates the conversion of mitomycin into its active forms capable of alkylating DNA. There are no specific transporters or carriers noted for mitomycin, which may affect its cellular uptake and distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
Mitomycin's pharmacogenetic profile involves the enzyme POR, which plays a role in its activation. Genetics can influence the expression and functionality of POR, potentially modifying the efficacy and toxicity of mitomycin. Individuals with variations in the POR gene could experience different outcomes when treated with mitomycin, impacting drug activation and subsequent antitumor activity. However, detailed pharmacogenetic data linking specific genetic variants in POR to clinical outcomes with mitomycin treatment needs further elucidation. Such information would be valuable in optimizing dosing and minimizing toxicity, especially given the drug's broad antitumor applications and usage in conjunction with surgical procedures.
