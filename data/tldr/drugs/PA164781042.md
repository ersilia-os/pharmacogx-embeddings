## Drug Summary
Flucloxacillin, also known under various brand names like Flopen, Floxapen, Fluclox, Softapen, and Staphylex, is a penicillin beta-lactam antibiotic primarily used to treat bacterial infections caused by susceptible, usually gram-positive, organisms. It belongs to the group of antibiotics derived from penicillins and is specifically an analog of cloxacillin. Flucloxacillin has a bioavailability of 50–70% after oral administration and is metabolized in the liver. The efficacy of flucloxacillin stems from its ability to inhibit cell wall synthesis in bacteria, contributing to its bactericidal activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Flucloxacillin operates by targeting penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), specifically PBP1A in certain bacteria like *Clostridium perfringens*. It binds to these PBPs within the bacterial cell wall, blocking the final stages of cell wall synthesis which leads to cell lysis, often augmented by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins. Flucloxacillin may also interact with autolysin inhibitors, thereby promoting bacterial destruction. Its metabolism involves the enzyme Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), a key enzyme in the liver that metabolizes various substances. Additionally, flucloxacillin is transported by ABCB11, also known as the bile salt export pump, which plays a role in drug disposition and clearance.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there is limited specific pharmacogenetic data linked directly to flucloxacillin. However, since this drug is metabolized by CYP3A4, genetic variations in the CYP3A4 gene could potentially influence the metabolism and efficacy of flucloxacillin. Variants in CYP3A4 can affect the enzyme's activity, possibly altering drug levels in the body and impacting both therapeutic effectiveness and the risk of adverse effects. Moreover, given flucloxacillin’s involvement with ABCB11, variations in the ABCB11 gene might impact drug transport and disposition, affecting the drug's efficacy and safety profile. These interactions are generally inferred based on the role of these proteins in drug metabolism and transport, highlighting potential areas for further pharmacogenetic investigation.
