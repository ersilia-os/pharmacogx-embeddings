## Drug Summary
Talazoparib is an oral, potent inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), specifically PARP1 and PARP2, key enzymes involved in DNA repair via the base excision repair pathway. Developed by Pfizer, talazoparib was first approved by the FDA in 2018, followed by approval in the EU and Canada. It's indicated for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm) HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. In the US, it is also indicated in combination with enzalutamide for HRR gene-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Its pharmacodynamics properties include significant cytotoxicity in cancer cell lines with defects in DNA repair genes, notably BRCA1 and BRCA2, exploiting the concept of synthetic lethality in cancer cells deficient in DNA repair. Following oral administration, talazoparib demonstrates substantial plasma concentration and achieves steady state in two to three weeks. It undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism, primarily involving mono-oxidation and glucuronide conjugation.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Talazoparib exerts its anti-cancer effects primarily through inhibition of PARP1 and PARP2. These targets allow talazoparib to block the repair of single-strand breaks in DNA, thus leading to double-strand breaks which cancer cells, particularly those deficient in BRCA1 or BRCA2, cannot efficiently repair. Talazoparib has minimal interaction with metabolic enzymes, which potentially reduces the risk of metabolic interactions. However, transporters such as ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1) and ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2) are involved in its transport, which might influence its distribution and excretion. No specific carriers are implicated in its pharmacokinetics according to the provided data.

## Pharmacogenetics
Talazoparib's efficacy is highly dependent on the genetic background of the cancer, specifically mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Patients with these mutations exhibit defective homologous recombination repair mechanisms, making them particularly susceptible to PARP inhibitors like talazoparib â€” a phenomenon termed "synthetic lethality." There is genome-driven indication, particularly in the presence of gBRCAm mutations for breast cancer and HRR mutations for prostate cancer. While there is no detailed pharmacogenomic data provided about variability in response or adverse effects due to other genetic differences in the population, the BRCA status of patients is pivotal in deciding the use of talazoparib. Future studies and data may shed light on additional pharmacogenetic factors influencing its efficacy and safety.
