## Drug Summary
Gilteritinib, marketed under the name ASP2215, is a small molecule FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor developed by Astellas Pharma. It is primarily used for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) harboring an FLT3 mutation. Gilteritinib displays greater selectivity and potency compared to other FLT3 inhibitors, avoiding the c-Kit-driven myelosuppression commonly seen in other therapies. This drug was approved by the FDA on November 28, 2018, benefiting from orphan drug, fast track, and priority review status. Pharmacokinetically, gilteritinib achieves maximum plasma concentration roughly 2 hours post oral administration, with a bioaccumulation factor of about 10 at steady-state within 15 days. It is primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4 resulting in active and inactive metabolites.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Gilteritinib acts as a potent inhibitor of FLT3 mutations, particularly the internal tandem duplication (ITD) and tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations, which are prevalent in about 30% of AML patients and are associated with poor outcomes. It also inhibits AXL and ALK tyrosine kinases, which play roles in the growth and resistance mechanisms of cancer cells. Aside from FLT3, AXL, and ALK, gilteritinib affects a broad spectrum of serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR1B, HTR1D, HTR1E, HTR1F, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR3A, HTR3B, HTR3C, HTR3D, HTR3E, HTR4, HTR6, HTR7). It is metabolized by CYP3A4 and transported by ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), SLC47A1 (Multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1), ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2), and SLC22A1 (Solute carrier family 22 member 1). Albumin (ALB) serves as a carrier.

## Pharmacogenetics
Gilteritinib's effectiveness and tolerability can be influenced by genetic variations in the FLT3 gene, determining the presence and type of FLT3 mutations (ITD or TKD) which are critical for its therapeutic application in AML. Additionally, genetic polymorphisms in the enzymes responsible for its metabolism, particularly CYP3A4, could impact its pharmacokinetics and resultant therapeutic outcomes. Variants in transporter genes like ABCB1 and ABCG2 might affect drug distribution and excretion, potentially altering efficacy and toxicity profiles. Despite the available drug and genetic interplay data, more research could enhance personalized treatment approaches in AML therapy, maximizing efficacy while minimizing adverse effects based on individual genetic profiles.
