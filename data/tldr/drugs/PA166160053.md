## Drug Summary
Brexpiprazole, marketed under various brand names, is an atypical antipsychotic medication primarily used as an adjunctive therapy for major depressive disorder in adults and for the treatment of schizophrenia. Approved by the FDA in July 2015, it is also utilized in managing agitation associated with Alzheimer’s disease dementia. Structurally similar to aripiprazole, brexpiprazole functions as a novel serotonin-dopamine activity modulator through its actions as a partial agonist at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors, and as an antagonist at various serotonin receptor subtypes. It provides therapeutic effects likely through receptor modulation linked to these psychiatric conditions, while demonstrating a high oral bioavailability and achieving steady-state concentrations in plasma within 10 to 12 days of dosing.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Brexpiprazole exhibits high affinity for a spectrum of receptors including serotonin receptors (5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT7), dopamine receptors (D2, D3), and alpha-adrenergic receptors (α1A, α1B, α1D, α2C). Additionally, it affects the histamine H1 and muscarinic acetylcholine M1 receptors. The primary enzymes involved in its metabolism are CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, crucial for the biotransformation of brexpiprazole into its pharmacologically inactive metabolite, DM-3411. Transported primarily by SLC47A2 (Multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 2), it has high plasma protein binding mediated by carriers like serum albumin (ALB) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1).

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of brexpiprazole prominently involves the CYP2D6 enzyme, a well-documented gene in pharmacogenomic studies featured for its genetic polymorphisms impacting drug metabolism. Individuals with different CYP2D6 genotypes may exhibit varied metabolic capabilities affecting brexpiprazole's efficacy and safety. Poor metabolizers (with compromised functional CYP2D6 alleles) may have increased exposure to the drug, potentially elevating the risk of side effects, while ultra-rapid metabolizers might exhibit reduced drug efficacy due to faster clearance. Current clinical guidelines often recommend dose adjustments or alternative therapies based on CYP2D6 genotyping, although specific recommendations for brexpiprazole should be consulted according to updated pharmacogenetic data and clinical judgment.
