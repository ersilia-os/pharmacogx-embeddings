## Drug Summary
Tilidine is an opioid analgesic used primarily for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. It is a synthetic opioid that acts on the central nervous system to relieve pain. Tilidine is often formulated as a prodrug, hydrochloride salt, which is converted in the liver into its active form, nortilidine. This activation involves the demethylation process commonly observed in opioid metabolism. The pharmacokinetics of Tilidine reveals that it is readily absorbed after oral administration, but detailed absorption data are sparse.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
There is no specific information provided in the DrugBank database about the targets, enzymes, transporters, and carriers associated with Tilidine. However, like other opioids, it is likely to exert its analgesic effects primarily through mu-opioid receptors. The metabolism of Tilidine typically involves hepatic enzymes, possibly involving the cytochrome P450 system, which is integral in the metabolism of many opioid drugs.

## Pharmacogenetics
While the provided DrugBank information lacks details about pharmacogenetic data concerning Tilidine, opioids in general are subject to significant pharmacogenetic variability which can affect both their efficacy and safety profiles. Key genes commonly implicated include CYP2D6, which is involved in the metabolism of various opioids. Variations in CYP2D6 can lead to differences in the rate and extent of metabolism, thereby influencing drug levels and effects. Although specific pharmacogenetic associations for Tilidine have not been detailed here, it is reasonable to infer that similar mechanisms may affect its pharmacokinetics and dynamics.
