## Drug Summary
Quinapril, which is marketed under various names such as Accupril, Accupro, and Acuitel, is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor primarily used in the management of hypertension and as adjunct therapy in heart failure. It operates as a prodrug, being converted in the body to its active form, quinaprilat. This conversion inhibits the production of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor, thereby lowering blood pressure and reducing the risk of thrombotic events. Quinapril was approved by the FDA in 1991 and is available in doses typically ranging from 10 to 80 mg, administered once daily. The bioavailability of quinapril is between 50-80%, and food intake, particularly high-fat meals, can decrease its absorption by 25-30%.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Quinapril's primary target is the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), pivotal in the renin-angiotensin system that regulates blood pressure and fluid balance. By inhibiting ACE, quinapril reduces the formation of angiotensin II and diminishes vasoconstriction and the secretion of aldosterone. Metabolism of quinapril involves the enzyme CES1, located in the liver, which contributes to the prodrug's conversion into quinaprilat. In terms of transport, quinapril and its metabolites interact with multiple solute carrier (SLC) family members, including SLC15A1, SLC15A2, and SLC22A8, which facilitate its cellular uptake and renal excretion. Additionally, quinapril binds significantly to serum albumin (ALB), affecting its distribution and clearance.

## Pharmacogenetics
While no specific pharmacogenetic data for quinapril was provided in the provided DrugBank entry, general pharmacogenetic principles apply to ACE inhibitors, including quinapril. Genetic variations in the ACE gene itself can influence the efficacy and side effect profile of ACE inhibitors. For instance, individuals with certain polymorphisms in the ACE gene might experience different levels of angiotensin II suppression, potentially requiring adjustments in quinapril dosage. Moreover, genetic differences in drug-metabolizing enzymes such as CES1 could also impact how patients metabolize quinapril, affecting both therapeutic outcomes and the risk of adverse effects. These observations highlight the need for personalized medicine approaches in the use of ACE inhibitors, including potential pharmacogenomic testing prior to therapy initiation to optimize treatment plans.
