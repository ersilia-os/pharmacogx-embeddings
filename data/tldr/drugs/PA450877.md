## Drug Summary
Perindopril is a nonsulfhydryl prodrug that belongs to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor class. It is primarily used to treat essential hypertension, mild to moderate congestive heart failure, and to reduce cardiovascular risks in patients with stable coronary disease post-myocardial infarction. Perindopril is metabolized in the liver to its active metabolite, perindoprilat, which significantly inhibits the ACE enzyme. This action prevents the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor involved in regulating blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Perindoprilat also impacts the degradation of bradykinin, leading to increased vasodilation. The drug is rapidly absorbed with a bioavailability of 65-75%, but this is reduced to 20% for perindoprilat. Food intake decreases the conversion of Perindopril to perindoprilat, impacting its bioavailability.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Perindopril's primary target is the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), where it acts by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, effectively reducing blood pressure. There are two isoforms of ACE, with the somatic isoform primarily targeted by perindoprilat for blood pressure regulation. Additionally, perindopril indirectly interacts with secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4), but the clinical significance of this interaction is less understood. In terms of drug metabolism, perindopril is predominantly metabolized by butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE) rather than cytochrome P450 enzymes, which is somewhat unusual for drugs in its class. Regarding active transport, Perindopril and its metabolites interact with solute carriers such as SLC15A1 and SLC15A2, which may influence its absorption and clearance.

## Pharmacogenetics
While the pharmacogenetics of perindopril are not as extensively studied as other drugs, variations in genes encoding for ACE could theoretically influence the response to perindopril, given that it directly inhibits this enzyme. Additionally, genetic polymorphisms in BCHE might affect the metabolism rate of perindopril, potentially altering its efficacy and safety profile. Moreover, genetic differences in transport proteins like SLC15A1 and SLC15A2 could also impact the pharmacokinetics of the drug, influencing absorption and excretion rates which, in turn, would affect blood levels and the pharmacodynamic properties. These pharmacogenetic associations could be pivotal in personalizing perindopril therapy, although specific clinical guidelines based on genetic variations are yet to be standardized.
