## Drug Summary
Clobazam is a benzodiazepine that is marketed under various names such as Onfi, Frisium, and Urbanyl. It was first developed in 1966 and became available as an anxiolytic in 1975 and an anticonvulsant in 1984. Pharmacologically, it enhances GABAergic transmission through interaction with the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, especially the α<sub>2</sub> subunit. This activity helps in increasing chloride conductance and neuronal hyperpolarization, which reduces neuron firing frequency and exerts a calming effect on the central nervous system. Clobazam is specifically approved for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients aged two years and older. It shows a dose-proportional pharmacokinetics over a range of 10-80 mg, with rapid and extensive absorption. The metabolism of clobazam primarily involves N-demethylation and hydroxylation through several cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, leading to its major metabolites which possess varying degrees of pharmacological activity.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Clobazam’s primary therapeutic action is mediated through its binding to the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor's benzodiazepine site, primarily involving the α<sub>2</sub>, α<sub>3</sub>, α<sub>5</sub>, γ<sub>1</sub>, γ<sub>2</sub>, and γ<sub>3</sub> subunits, promoting inhibitory effects that alleviate symptoms of anxiety and seizures. In terms of metabolism, clobazam is extensively processed by liver enzymes including CYP3A4, CYP2B6, and importantly CYP2C19. Other enzymes like CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and UGT families also contribute to its metabolism. Clobazam is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), a key efflux transporter, affecting its distribution. The protein binding involves primarily albumin (ALB) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1).

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of clobazam prominently involves CYP2C19, a polymorphic enzyme. Variants, particularly rs4244285 (CYP2C19*2), lead to reduced enzyme activity, significantly affecting the metabolism of clobazam. Patients carrying these genetic variants (poor metabolizers) exhibit higher plasma levels of N-desmethylclobazam, clobazam's active metabolite, which can alter drug efficacy and increase the risk of adverse effects. Tailoring clobazam dosage in the context of CYP2C19 genetic makeup may be essential to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize side effects. Pharmacogenetic testing can guide adjustments in dosing or even the choice of alternative therapies in populations defined by their CYP2C19 status.
