## Drug Summary
Lapatinib, also known by its brand name Tycerb, is an oral anti-cancer medication primarily used to treat solid tumors like breast and lung cancer, with specific indication in combination with capecitabine for advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients whose tumors overexpress HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) and have received prior therapy including an anthracycline, a taxane, and trastuzumab. Approved by the FDA in 2007, lapatinib acts by inhibiting the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains of both HER2 and EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor). The drug's effectiveness extends to trastuzumab-conditioned cell lines, suggesting non-cross-resistance. Lapatinib is absorbed variably and incompletely when administered orally and is metabolized predominantly by the cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Lapatinib targets the tyrosine kinase domains of HER2 (ERBB2) and EGFR (ERBB1), obstructing the autophosphorylation and subsequent activation of these receptors, crucial for the proliferation of cancer cells. The primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of lapatinib are CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19, which produce various oxidated metabolites. Its distribution and excretion involve transporters such as ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1) and TAP1 (Antigen peptide transporter 1), which might affect the drug's bioavailability and toxicity. No specific carriers have been listed as associated with lapatinib.

## Pharmacogenetics
Genetic variations, particularly polymorphisms in the genes such as HLA-DQA1, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1, and TNXB have been reported to influence individual responses to lapatinib, predominantly concerning drug-induced hepatotoxicity and elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. The genomic data suggests that these polymorphisms may contribute to an increased risk of adverse reactions, though specific RS ID (genotypes) and detailed mechanisms of how these genetic variants affect lapatinib pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics are yet to be fully established. These genetic markers might serve as potential indicators for customized therapy and might guide more personalized dosing or monitoring strategies to mitigate risks and improve treatment outcomes.
