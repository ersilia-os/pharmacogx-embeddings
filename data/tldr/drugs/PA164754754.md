## Drug Summary
Cevimeline, also known as Saligren, is a parasympathomimetic agent used primarily to manage the symptoms of dry mouth in patients with Sjögren's Syndrome. As a muscarinic agonist, cevimeline specifically targets muscarinic acetylcholine receptors M1 and M3, enhancing saliva secretion and thereby alleviating dry mouth, a common symptom in Sjögren's Syndrome. This drug is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, achieving peak concentration within 1.5 to 2 hours. Cevimeline’s metabolism predominantly occurs in the liver, mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, along with additional metabolism pathways leading to various metabolites such as sulfoxides and glucuronic acid conjugates.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Cevimeline acts by activating muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, specifically CHRM1 (M1) and CHRM3 (M3). The M1 receptor activation primarily affects secretory glands, increasing secretion, while M3 receptor activation influences both gland secretion and smooth muscle contraction, contributing significantly to the drug’s therapeutic effects in increasing salivary output. The metabolism of cevimeline involves key hepatic enzymes: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and FMO1. These enzymes are responsible for converting cevimeline into various metabolites, influencing both the effectiveness and duration of the drug's action. Importantly, there are no significant transporters or carriers identified that are associated with cevimeline’s pharmacokinetic profile.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of cevimeline's interaction with the body is influenced by variations in the genes encoding for its metabolic enzymes, particularly CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Genetic polymorphisms in these cytochrome P450 enzymes can lead to differences in the metabolism of cevimeline, potentially affecting both the efficacy and safety of the drug. For example, individuals with certain CYP2D6 poor metabolizer phenotypes may experience higher concentrations of cevimeline, leading to increased potency or adverse effects, whereas those with multiple copies of the CYP2D6 gene might metabolize the drug too quickly, possibly reducing its effectiveness. However, specific pharmacogenetic guidelines for cevimeline concerning these genetic variations are not detailed extensively in the available literature and would benefit from further clinical research to clarify these associations.
