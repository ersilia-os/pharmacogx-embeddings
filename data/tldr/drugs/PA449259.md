## Drug Summary
Dexrazoxane, known under various names including Ao Nuo Xian and Cardioxane, is an antimitotic agent that serves chiefly as a cardioprotective drug against anthracycline toxicity, commonly used in the context of cancer chemotherapy. It is particularly indicated for reducing cardiomyopathy in women with metastatic breast cancer receiving doxorubicin, once a substantial cumulative dose of doxorubicin has been administered. Dexrazoxane functions as a chelator primarily of iron, believed to mitigate the deleterious effects by interrupting the iron-mediated formation of free radicals associated with doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Administered intravenously, dexrazoxane is fully bioavailable, undergoing hepatic and renal metabolism where it is hydrolyzed into active metabolites that further aid in its metal-ion binding capacity.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Dexrazoxane acts specifically on DNA topoisomerase 2-alpha (TOP2A) and DNA topoisomerase 2-beta (TOP2B). These enzymes are critical in controlling and altering the topologic states of DNA during transcription. By modulating these enzymes, dexrazoxane indirectly prevents the detrimental changes in DNA architecture typically induced by anthracyclines, which are known for intercalating within DNA strands and disrupting normal enzymatic processes. Remarkably, there are no significant transporters or carriers explicitly associated with the drug, suggesting a relatively straightforward pharmacokinetic profile primarily centered around its enzymatic interactions and subsequent metabolism.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is limited specific pharmacogenetic data provided for dexrazoxane in the given sources. However, general knowledge in the field implies potential pharmacogenetic considerations given its interaction with topoisomerases and the associated metabolism pathways. Variants in genes encoding topoisomerases or metal ion transport and storage (such as those involving iron metabolism) could hypothetically influence dexrazoxaneâ€™s efficacy and safety profile. Since the drug is metabolized to active metabolites engaging in chelation, genetic variations in the enzyme dihydropyrimidine amidohydrolase might also impact its activity and toxicity levels, although direct evidence in this specific context is yet to be robustly documented. Further pharmacogenetic studies would be beneficial to fully elucidate these relationships and optimize individual patient care.
