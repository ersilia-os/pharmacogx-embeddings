## Drug Summary
Cortisone acetate, also known as Cortisyl, is a synthetic glucocorticoid first isolated in 1935. It is used primarily to manage and treat various inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, including endocrine, rheumatic, dermatologic, allergic, respiratory, hematologic, neoplastic, and gastrointestinal disorders. Cortisone acetate functions by mimicking the effects of the naturally occurring steroid hormones produced by the adrenal gland. It binds to the glucocorticoid receptor, influencing gene expression to exert anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive actions. This drug was FDA approved on June 13, 1950, and has a moderate duration of action, usually necessitating daily administration. The pharmacodynamic profile highlights its role in reducing inflammation through multiple pathways, such as inhibiting leukocyte migration, decreasing capillary permeability, and suppressing the release of inflammatory mediators.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Cortisone acetate acts primarily through the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), modifying transcriptional activity to produce anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Another target, Annexin A1 (ANXA1), mediates the anti-inflammatory actions by modulating phospholipase A2 activity, which in turn reduces the production of inflammatory arachidonic acid derivatives. The drug is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, which play crucial roles in its hepatic metabolism. Transport proteins such as the solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1A2 (SLCO1A2), P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), and solute carrier family 22 member 8 (SLC22A8) are involved in its pharmacokinetics, influencing distribution and elimination. Cortisone acetate also interacts with protein carriers including corticosteroid-binding globulin (SERPINA6) and serum albumin (ALB), which affect its systemic availability and biological effects.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of cortisone acetate involve its metabolism primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, enzymes known for their genetic polymorphisms that lead to variable enzyme activity among individuals. Polymorphisms in these genes can significantly affect the drug's pharmacokinetics, potentially altering its efficacy and safety profile. Individuals with variants in these genes may exhibit different responses to treatment, necessitating adjustments in dosing. Furthermore, genetic variations affecting the expression or function of the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) might influence patient responses to cortisone acetate, as alterations in receptor sensitivity can impact drug effectiveness and susceptibility to side effects. Although specific pharmacogenomic data was not provided, these interactions suggest potential areas for personalized medicine approaches in enhancing therapeutic outcomes and minimizing adverse effects for cortisone acetate treatments.
