## Drug Summary
Fexofenadine, marketed under names such as Fastofen, Fexidine, Telfast, and Vifas, is an over-the-counter second-generation antihistamine utilized for the treatment of allergic symptoms like allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria. Its mechanism involves antagonism of the H1 histamine receptor, which mediates hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Fexofenadine is known for its selectivity for the H1 receptor and minimal activity at off-targets, allowing it to be effective without the sedative effects common to first-generation antihistamines. This drug is a major active metabolite of terfenadine and exhibits a rapid onset of action (1-3 hours) with a bioavailability of about 33%. Importantly, its absorption is reduced significantly when taken with fruit juices, owing to interaction with certain transporters.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Fexofenadine primarily targets the Histamine H1 receptor (HRH1) to exert its antiallergic effects. While it is minimally metabolized, with only about 5% of the ingested dose undergoing hepatic metabolism, particular importance is placed on the transport processes affecting its pharmacokinetics. Several transporters play roles in its absorption and excretion, including P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1) and various members of the solute carrier organic anion transporter family (SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, SLCO2B1, SLCO1A2). Additionally, canalicular multispecific organic anion transporters (ABCC2 and ABCC3) and the solute carrier family 22 member 8 (SLC22A8) are involved. Moreover, fexofenadine is carried by serum albumin (ALB) and alpha1-acid glycoprotein (ORM2).

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of fexofenadine largely centers on its interaction with transporters, particularly ABCB1 and SLCO proteins, which can influence its pharmacokinetics considerably. Variations in the genes encoding these transporters may affect the drug's absorption, distribution, and clearance. Though not deeply established, the influence of genetic variability in these transporter genes could explain differences in therapeutic outcomes and side effects among individuals. Pharmacogenetic research could potentially refine dosage recommendations and improve therapeutic efficacy based on individual genetic profiles. While existing clinical guidelines do not yet incorporate these aspects into routine clinical practice, continuing research may provide more insights into tailoring fexofenadine administration for optimized patient-specific therapy.
