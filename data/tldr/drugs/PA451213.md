## Drug Summary
Quinine is an alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree, historically significant as an antimalarial agent. Apart from its primary use in treating malaria, especially chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum infections, it is also employed to relieve nocturnal leg cramps and myotonia congenita due to its muscle membrane stabilizing activity. This drug has notable antipyretic and analgesic properties and has found its way into common cold preparations as well. Quinine is administered parenterally and exhibits an absorption rate between 76% and 88%. It undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism, predominantly mediated by several cytochrome P450 enzymes, with over 80% being metabolized in the liver.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Quinine targets include glycoprotein IX (GP9) and the intermediate conductance calcium-activated potassium channel protein 4 (KCNN4), impacting platelet function and potassium ion transport, respectively. The drug is metabolized primarily by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP1A1, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, and CYP3A7. Transport mechanisms involve several solute carriers such as SLC22A2, SLC22A1, SLC22A5, SLCO1A2, SLC22A4, and SLCO1B1, as well as the efflux transporter ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1). There is no indication of specific carrier proteins involved in its pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of quinine is largely influenced by polymorphisms in the CYP enzymes that metabolize it. Variants in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, for instance, can alter the metabolism of quinine, potentially affecting both efficacy and toxicity. Additionally, the drug-induced thrombocytopenia associated with quinine is mediated through the immune generation of antibodies against platelet glycoproteins, namely GPIb-IX and GPIIb-IIIa. Genetic predispositions affecting the immune response to quinine or the baseline levels of these glycoproteins might influence susceptibility to adverse effects. The pharmacokinetics may also vary across individuals with different polymorphic forms of the involved solute carriers and P-glycoprotein, impacting drug absorption and elimination.
