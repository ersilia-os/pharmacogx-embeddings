## Drug Summary
Fluphenazine is a phenothiazine antipsychotic used primarily for the management of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. It shares many properties with other drugs in its class, like chlorpromazine. The drug's mechanism involves the blockade of postsynaptic mesolimbic dopaminergic D1 and D2 receptors, which are critical in the pathology of schizophrenia and other psychoses. Fluphenazine also impacts various hormonal releases and the reticular activating system, influencing basal metabolism, body temperature, wakefulness, and more. However, it has not proven effective in managing behavioral complications in patients with mental retardation.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Fluphenazine acts on several molecular targets including dopamine D2 (DRD2) and D1 (DRD1) receptors, which are crucial for its antipsychotic effects. It also interacts with other receptors such as the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (HTR2A) and 2C (HTR2C), calmodulin (CALM1), and the androgen receptor (AR). In terms of metabolism, fluphenazine is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP2D6 and CYP2E1. The drug is also a substrate for the transporter protein P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), which influences its absorption and distribution within the body.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of fluphenazine is particularly influential in patient response and tolerance to the drug. Variants in the CYP2D6 gene can significantly affect the metabolism of fluphenazine. CYP2D6 polymorphisms result in varied enzyme activity levels among individuals, categorizing them into poor, intermediate, extensive, or ultra-rapid metabolizers. Poor and intermediate metabolizers may experience increased adverse effects or toxicity due to slower drug clearance, whereas ultra-rapid metabolizers might require higher doses for therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, genetic variants in the DRD2 and ABCB1 genes could influence the drug's effectiveness and side effects, impacting receptor binding and drug transport respectively. These genetic factors should be considered to optimize dosing and minimize adverse effects in clinical practice, although specific guidelines or recommendations might still be under research or development.
