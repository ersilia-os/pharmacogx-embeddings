## Drug Summary
Risedronic acid, also marketed under brand names such as Benet and Ridron, belongs to the class of bisphosphonates, specifically recognized as a third-generation agent. Its principal use lies in the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in various demographics including postmenopausal women, men, and individuals undergoing long-term glucocorticoid therapy. Additionally, it serves as a treatment for Paget's disease. This drug is notable for its low oral bioavailability (0.63%), with peak absorption approximately an hour post-administration. It is minimally impacted by metabolic processes, mainly because its structure, particularly the P-C-P group, resists chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis. In terms of toxicity, common adverse effects include back pain, arthralgia, and gastrointestinal disturbances; more severe reactions can involve angioedema and ocular effects.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Risedronate primarily targets farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FDPS) within the bone cells. The drug binds to bone hydroxyapatite and is released when bone resorption occurs. Through this interaction, the drug enters osteoclasts, subsequently disrupting their function by inducing apoptosis via interference with the enzyme FDPS—a crucial catalyst in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. There is also interaction with PTGS2 (Prostaglandin G/H synthase 2), suggesting a secondary pathway through which risedronate might influence inflammation and bone metabolism, though this enzyme's exact role in the drug's action is less defined. No specific transporters or carriers are directly associated with Risedronic acid's pharmacokinetic profile.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there are no extensively validated pharmacogenetic data in the context of risedronic acid directly affecting its pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics available from the given sources. However, the potential pharmacogenetic implications might stem from variability in genes encoding for bone turnover enzymes and proteins such as FDPS and PTGS2. Variations in these genes could hypothetically influence the efficacy and safety profile of the drug, altering the individual response to therapy. Extensive research could hence be warranted to investigate such associations, considering the drug’s critical function in bone metabolism and the importance of personalized medicine in managing osteoporosis and related disorders.
