## Drug Summary
Oxazepam, marketed under many names such as Serax, Sobril, and Anxiolit, is an intermediate-acting 3-hydroxybenzodiazepine. It is primarily prescribed for the management of anxiety disorders and the short-term relief of anxiety symptoms. Additionally, it is useful in the management of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Related to lorazepam in its chemical structure, oxazepam presents advantages like reduced pharmacokinetic variability, thus being less affected by patient-specific factors such as age or liver disease. This characteristic stems from its straightforward metabolism into largely inactive metabolites. Pharmacodynamically, oxazepam enhances the effect of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, by potentiating GABAergic neurotransmission through the GABA(A) receptors. This results in sedative and anxiolytic effects.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Oxazepam acts primarily through the GABA(A) receptors located in the CNS, where it functions as a positive allosteric modulator. Specifically, it binds to the interface between the alpha (α) and gamma (γ) subunits of the receptor at the benzodiazepine binding site, enhancing the receptor's response to GABA. The drug's metabolism is largely handled through glucuronidation, with major enzymes involved being UGT2B15 and UGT2B7 for different stereoisomers, and UGT1A9. Oxazepam's major metabolic product is a glucuronide conjugate, which is inactive. Additionally, the protein carrier serum albumin (ALB) may play a role in the transport of oxazepam in the blood.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors influencing oxazepam metabolism primarily involve the glucuronidation process, which is catalyzed by the UGT enzymes. Variants in the genes encoding these enzymes (UGT2B15, UGT2B7, and UGT1A9) can lead to variability in oxazepam metabolism among individuals. Genetic polymorphisms in these UGT genes may affect the metabolism rate of oxazepam, potentially altering its efficacy and risk of side effects in different individuals. For instance, certain polymorphisms in UGT2B15 and UGT2B7 can lead to either enhanced or reduced glucuronidation activity, which could influence the drug's clearance rate and plasma concentration. Currently, routine genetic testing before oxazepam treatment is not standard, but understanding these genetic factors could be beneficial in personalizing dosing strategies and minimizing adverse effects in specific patient populations.
