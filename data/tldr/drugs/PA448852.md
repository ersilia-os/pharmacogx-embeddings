## Drug Summary
Cefotaxime, also known by trade names such as Rantaksym, Raxim, Spinocef, Sporim, and Talcef, is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic. It is chiefly used intravenously and is known for its efficacy against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, although it lacks activity against *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. This drug is particularly noted for its ability to resist penicillinases, making it effective against bacteria resistant to penicillin derivatives. Cefotaxime is commonly utilized for treating severe bacterial infections such as gonorrhea, meningitis, pyelonephritis, and infections of the urinary system. It may also be used prophylactically to prevent post-surgical infections. The drug is rapidly absorbed when administered intramuscularly and undergoes substantial renal excretion both as unchanged drug and as metabolites, with the desacetyl derivative considerably contributing to its bactericidal activity.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The bactericidal effect of cefotaxime is mediated through the inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis, achieved by binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). It shows a high affinity for several PBPs including PBP1b, PBP3, and others in organisms such as *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Bacillus subtilis*. No specific enzymes involved in cefotaxime's metabolism are detailed, but various solute carriers play roles in its transport. These include SLC22A6, SLC22A8, SLC15A1, and SLC15A2 among others, indicating the involvement of multiple transport mechanisms in the management of systemic cefotaxime levels. No specific carriers are identified for cefotaxime in the provided dataset.

## Pharmacogenetics
While the provided data do not include specific pharmacogenetic insights for cefotaxime, some general inferences can be made. Given its involvement with various solute carriers, genetic variants in genes encoding these transporters (such as SLC22A6 or SLC15A1) might influence the drugâ€™s pharmacokinetics, potentially affecting absorption and elimination profiles, and thereby altering efficacy or toxicity risks. However, extensive studies specific to cefotaxime that directly tie such genetic factors to patient outcomes remain sparse. Further research could provide vital insights into how genetic variations impact the clinical use of cefotaxime, guiding more personalized therapeutic approaches.
