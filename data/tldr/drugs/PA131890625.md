## Drug Summary
Tenoxicam, marketed under several names including Mobiflex and Tilcotil, belongs to the oxicam class of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It is primarily used for its anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects. Tenoxicam is indicated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and other forms of acute and chronic pain, including backache. The drug's analgesic and antipyretic properties derive from its mechanism of action involving the inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2), which play a crucial role in the synthesis of prostaglandins that sensitize pain receptors. Tenoxicam shows rapid and complete oral absorption, with an absolute bioavailability of 100%, and it is metabolized in the liver primarily to inactive metabolites.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Tenoxicam acts through the inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes, specifically targeting PTGS1 (COX-1) and PTGS2 (COX-2), which are involved in prostaglandin synthesis and play a significant role in inflammation and pain mechanisms. Being metabolized predominantly in the liver, tenoxicam involves the cytochrome P450 enzyme, specifically CYP2C9, in its metabolic pathway. The drug's active transport process involves the transporter protein SLC22A8 (solute carrier family 22 member 8), which influences its renal excretion. No specific carriers involved in the drugâ€™s action or pharmacokinetics have been listed.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of tenoxicam involves its metabolism by CYP2C9, an enzyme subject to genetic variability. Polymorphisms in the CYP2C9 gene can affect the metabolic rate of tenoxicam, potentially altering its efficacy and safety profile. Patients with certain genetic variants of CYP2C9 might experience reduced metabolic activity, leading to higher plasma levels of tenoxicam, which could increase the risk of adverse effects. However, concrete data linking specific CYP2C9 variants with tenoxicam pharmacokinetics and clinical outcomes are limited and would benefit from further research. Understanding these genetic factors is crucial for optimizing tenoxicam therapy, particularly in personalized medicine settings.
