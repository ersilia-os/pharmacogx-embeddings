## Drug Summary
Ethambutol, also known under brand names such as Etibi and Tibutol, is a bacteriostatic antimicrobial agent specifically indicated for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. This drug is commonly used in a regimen with other anti-tuberculosis medications including isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide. Having gained FDA approval in 1967, ethambutol’s mechanism primarily revolves around its ability to inhibit arabinosyltransferase enzymes (embA, embB, and embC) in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, which leads to impaired cell wall synthesis. The drug shows good oral bioavailability at around 75-80%, with peak serum concentrations reached within two to four hours after administration. Its metabolism involves oxidation by aldehyde dehydrogenase.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Ethambutol targets arabinosyltransferases in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*—specifically, embA, embB, and embC. These enzymes are crucial for the polymerization of arabinogalactan, a vital component of the bacterial cell wall. Inhibition of these targets leads to a blockade in cell wall synthesis, impairing bacterial growth and multiplication. Regarding metabolism in humans, ethambutol is metabolized by several cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4. There are no specific transporters or carriers identified for ethambutol affecting its pharmacokinetics notably.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic aspects of ethambutol primarily involve enzymes responsible for its metabolism, notably CYP1A2. Genetic polymorphisms in this enzyme can influence the pharmacokinetics of ethambutol, as evidenced by variability in the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC). Such genetic variations can affect drug exposure, which may impact both efficacy and toxicity, underscoring the importance of monitoring for side effects, particularly optic neuritis—a serious adverse effect. Although not specifically detailed in the genomic data provided, it is plausible that polymorphisms in other metabolizing enzymes like CYP2E1, CYP2C19, and others might similarly influence individual responses to ethambutol therapy. Given these possibilities, pharmacogenetic testing might inform personalized dosing strategies to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects.
