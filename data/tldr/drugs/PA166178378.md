## Drug Summary
Uric acid, known chemically as the final product of purine metabolism in humans, has no approved therapeutic use but is under investigation for its potential role in acute ischemic stroke as an adjunct to alteplase. Endogenously, uric acid is synthesized via xanthine oxidase oxidation of oxypurines. Elevated levels, known as hyperuricemia, can contribute to conditions like gout and kidney stones due to its crystallization. Uric acid acts as an antioxidant and has shown neuroprotective effects in animal and preliminary human studies due to its ability to reduce oxidative stress, which benefits neurological outcomes post-stroke. It is not further metabolized owing to the absence of uricase in higher primates and humans, resulting in its excretion.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
While uric acid does not specifically have defined molecular targets, nor does it act enzymatically, its physiological transport mechanisms are pertinent to its role in the body. The transport of uric acid across cell membranes is facilitated by various transport proteins, including Solute carrier family 22 member 6 (SLC22A6), Solute carrier family 22 member 8 (SLC22A8), and Solute carrier family 2, facilitated glucose transporter member 9 (SLC2A9). These transporters help in the renal excretion and reabsorption of uric acid, influencing its plasma levels and distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic relationships involving uric acid primarily concern its transport, influenced by genetic variations within the genes encoding its transporters. Variants in the SLC2A9 gene, for example, significantly affect uric acid plasma levels, potentially impacting conditions like gout and the efficacy of uric acid as a neuroprotective agent in stroke therapy. Research suggests that genetic predispositions tied to these solute carriers can alter the risk and treatment outcomes of diseases associated with abnormal uric acid levels.
