## Drug Summary
Calcitriol, known by trade names such as Rocaltrol, Calcijex, Decostriol, and others, is the active metabolite of vitamin D3 and plays a pivotal role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. This drug is chiefly involved in the regulation of calcium levels in the body by promoting absorption of calcium and phosphate in the intestine, enhancing renal reabsorption of calcium, and mobilizing calcium from bone. It is used for treating conditions related to disturbances in calcium metabolism such as secondary hyperparathyroidism, renal osteodystrophy, hypocalcemia, and osteoporosis. Available in oral, intravenous, and topical forms, it demonstrates diverse pharmacodynamic effects including immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and potential anticancer activities through its role in cell differentiation and proliferation.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Calcitriol acts primarily through the Vitamin D3 receptor (VDR), influencing various biological processes by modulating gene expression. VDR is a nuclear hormone receptor that, upon binding with calcitriol, forms a complex influencing DNA transcription. Target tissues mainly include the intestine, bones, and kidneys. Calcitriol is metabolized by CYP24A1, an enzyme contributing to its catabolism into less active metabolites, primarily in the kidney but also in target tissues. Another enzyme involved partially in the metabolism of calcitriol is CYP3A4. The Vitamin D-binding protein (GC), acts as a primary carrier, regulating its bioavailability and transport in circulation.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetics of calcitriol revolves mostly around its interaction with VDR. Variations in VDR gene influence the efficacy and metabolic response to calcitriol. Individuals with different VDR polymorphisms may exhibit variations in bone density response, susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, and potential response to treatment in conditions like osteoporosis and psoriasis. Furthermore, mutations in CYP24A1 could potentially alter calcitriol degradation, leading to variations in drug levels and activity, impacting therapeutic outcomes. The role of CYP3A4, known for its genetic variability, suggests possible influences on calcitriol metabolism, though specific interactions in pharmacogenetic contexts are yet to be comprehensively elucidated.
