## Drug Summary
Amoxicillin, also known by other names such as Actimoxi, Clamoxyl, Larotid, and several others, is a penicillin G derivative with bacteriocidal activity, primarily through the inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. This antibiotic was first described in 1972 and received FDA approval in January 1974. It is indicated for the treatment of various susceptible bacterial infections including those of the ear, nose, throat, and genitourinary tract, as well as skin and lower respiratory tract infections. When combined with clavulanic acid or other agents like omeprazole, it is used to treat conditions like acute bacterial sinusitis, community-acquired pneumonia, and _Helicobacter pylori_ infections. The pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin include an oral bioavailability of approximately 60%, with a peak serum concentration reached 1-2 hours after administration. It’s also characterized by a long duration of action, typically requiring dosing twice daily.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Amoxicillin acts by competitively inhibiting various penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), especially PBP1, which is essential for the cross-linking processes in bacterial cell wall biosynthesis and repair mechanisms. The inhibition leads to disruption of bacterial cell wall construction, resulting in bacterial cell death. The drug is metabolized by several human liver enzymes, producing multiple metabolites through pathways like hydroxylation, oxidative deamination, and glucuronidation, though clinical implications of these metabolites are less clear. Notably, transporters such as SLC15A1, SLC15A2, and SLC22A6 are involved in its transport, affecting its distribution and excretion. Amoxicillin also interacts with carriers such as serum albumin (ALB), although this interaction typically does not significantly impact its action.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic implications of amoxicillin are primarily related to its metabolism and the likelihood of drug-induced liver injury or hypersensitivity reactions, which have been noted in some patients. The involvement of enzymes like CYP2C8 suggests potential variability in drug clearance and efficacy based on genetic variants within this enzyme, although definitive clinical pharmacogenetic guidelines specific to amoxicillin use are not fully established. Moreover, genetic variants affecting transporter proteins like SLC15A1 and SLC22A6 may influence amoxicillin’s pharmacokinetics, potentially impacting absorption and elimination. These genetic interactions could inform personalized dosing to minimize toxicity and optimize therapeutic efficacy, although routine clinical testing prior to amoxicillin therapy is not currently standard practice.
