## Drug Summary
Praziquantel is an anthelmintic agent used primarily for the treatment of infections by trematodes and cestodes, such as schistosomiasis, taeniasis, and cysticercosis. This drug is a pyrazino-isoquinolin derivative and plays a crucial role in low-cost public health strategies, including the WHO's plan to eliminate schistosomiasis by 2030. Approved since 1980, praziquantel achieves therapeutic efficacy through an increase in cell membrane permeability in parasitic worms, leading to contraction and tegument disintegration in adult worms more markedly than in juveniles. Praziquantel is well absorbed orally with high bioavailability, and its metabolism is prominently managed by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, undergoing significant first-pass metabolism.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
While praziquantel’s specific molecular targets are not definitively known, it is hypothesized to affect the β subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels, notably in Schistosoma species. This interaction leads to increased calcium influx, which is crucial for its anthelmintic action. The enzyme profile involved in its metabolism includes CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5, which are responsible for its rapid biotransformation in the liver. Additionally, praziquantel binds to plasma proteins such as serum albumin (ALB), which may influence its distribution and pharmacokinetics. Transporter data related to the drug remains unspecified.

## Pharmacogenetics
Praziquantel's effectiveness and safety profile might be influenced by genetic variations in the enzymes that metabolize the drug, particularly those in the cytochrome P450 family. Variants in genes such as CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 could affect the drug's metabolism rate, leading to variations in drug levels and responses among individuals. For example, individuals with certain CYP2C19 polymorphisms might exhibit faster or slower metabolism of praziquantel, potentially requiring adjustments in dosage for optimal therapeutic outcomes. However, extensive clinical pharmacogenetic data are not currently available, and further research could help to delineate these relationships more clearly.
