## Drug Summary
Fluticasone propionate, sold under brand names such as Ezicas, Flixonase, Flixotide, and others, is a synthetic glucocorticoid first approved in 1990. It is used primarily for its anti-inflammatory properties across various formulations including inhalers for asthma, nasal sprays for rhinitis, and topical creams for skin conditions. The drug acts by activating glucocorticoid receptors, leading to a reduction in inflammation. Fluticasone propionate has very low systemic bioavailability (less than 2% intranasally and less than 1% orally), which minimizes systemic effects. Its metabolism mainly occurs in the liver via cytochrome P450 3A4, converting it into an inactive metabolite. 

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Fluticasone propionate interacts with several molecular targets to exert its effects. Key targets include the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), which mediates anti-inflammatory actions, and the progesterone receptor (PGR). It also affects cytosolic phospholipase A2 (PLA2G4A) and the mineralocorticoid receptor (NR3C2). Metabolism of the drug is predominantly catalyzed by CYP3A4, with contributions from CYP3A5, CYP3A7, and CYP2C8. Fluticasone propionate is also a substrate for transporters such as P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1) and the organic anion transporter SLCO1B1. The solute carrier SLCO1B1 and corticosteroid-binding globulin (SERPINA6) function as carriers, affecting its distribution and bioavailability.

## Pharmacogenetics
Fluticasone propionate's response and metabolism can be influenced by genetic variations in genes encoding for its metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Variants in the CYP3A4 gene can alter the rate of fluticasone metabolism, potentially affecting drug levels and efficacy. Polymorphisms in the transporter genes like ABCB1 and SLCO1B1 may impact the drugâ€™s distribution and elimination, influencing both efficacy and risk of side effects. Although specific pharmacogenetic recommendations are not currently provided in the FDA label, these genetic considerations could be pertinent for personalized dosing and minimizing adverse effects in patients with altered enzyme or transporter function. Further exploration in clinical studies targeting these genetic variations could provide deeper insights and more targeted therapeutic strategies.
