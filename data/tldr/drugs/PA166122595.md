## Drug Summary
Vortioxetine is an antidepressant medication used primarily for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). It belongs to the class of drugs known as serotonin modulators and stimulators (SMS), and has a distinctive multimodal action on the serotonin system. Vortioxetine functions in part as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI), impeding the serotonin transporter and thus enhancing serotonin levels in the brain. This action is complemented by its interactions with various serotonin receptor subtypes: it serves as an antagonist at 5-HT3, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT7 receptors, a partial agonist at the 5-HT1B receptor, and an agonist at the 5-HT1A receptor. Pharmacokinetically, vortioxetine has an oral bioavailability of 75% and reaches its peak concentration in plasma within 7 to 11 hours after dosing, with no noted impact from food intake.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Vortioxetine's molecular targets include the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) which it inhibits, and several serotonin receptors including 5-HT3A (HTR3A), 5-HT1B (HTR1B), 5-HT1A (HTR1A), and 5-HT7 (HTR7), denoting a broad spectrum of engagement within the serotonin system. Additionally, although vortioxetine's main action is not on adrenergic systems, it also briefly interacts with the beta-1 adrenergic receptor (ADRB1). The drug is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily through several cytochrome P450 isozymes, particularly CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, and others like CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, and CYP2B6. No specific transporters or carriers are identified as key to its pharmacokinetic profile.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of vortioxetine are particularly relevant with regards to its metabolism through various cytochrome P450 enzymes. The enzyme CYP2D6 is crucial as it primarily catalyzes the oxidation of vortioxetine; genetic variants in CYP2D6 that affect enzyme activity can significantly influence drug levels and, consequently, the efficacy and safety of vortioxetine. Individuals with reduced CYP2D6 activity ("poor metabolizers") may exhibit up to twice the plasma concentration of the drug compared to those with normal enzyme function ("extensive metabolizers"). This variability can lead to differences in side effects or the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly when vortioxetine is combined with other serotonergic agents. This suggests that genotyping for CYP2D6 variants might be beneficial in personalizing vortioxetine treatment to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects.
