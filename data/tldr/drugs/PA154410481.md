## Drug Summary
Prasugrel, marketed under names such as Prasita, is an antiplatelet medication primarily used to manage and prevent atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Approved by the FDA in 2009, it belongs to the thienopyridine class of ADP receptor inhibitors, similar to clopidogrel. Prasugrel functions by irreversibly inhibiting the platelet P2Y12 receptor, a key player in platelet activation and aggregation. As a prodrug, prasugrel requires enzymatic conversion in the liver to its active metabolite, R-138727, which then binds to the P2Y12 receptor on platelets, inhibiting ADP-mediated activation. The drug is rapidly absorbed upon oral administration with peak plasma concentrations achieved roughly 30 minutes post-ingestion, and may be taken with or without food. Metabolism is predominantly via cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Prasugrel specifically targets the P2Y purinoceptor 12 (P2RY12) on platelets, fundamentally blocking the activation and aggregation of platelets. The drug is metabolized primarily through a sequence initiated by the carboxylesterase 2 (CES2) in the intestine, which hydrolyzed prasugrel to an intermediate metabolite. Subsequent conversion to the active metabolite involves primarily CYP3A4 and CYP2B6, with lesser contributions from CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. The active metabolite is then subject to further metabolism by S-methylation or conjugation. Serum albumin (ALB) acts as a carrier, but no significant transporters are identified in the drug’s profile, indicating a limited role or absence in the drug’s pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
Prasugrel’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are less influenced by genetic polymorphisms compared to other thienopyridines like clopidogrel, particularly those affecting the cytochrome P450 enzymes. This implies that genetic variations in enzymes such as CYP2C19, which significantly impacts clopidogrel metabolism, do not notably affect the activation of prasugrel. However, variations in other metabolic enzymes (CES2, CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C9) might subtly influence its pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics, though explicit pharmacogenetic data are limited. Understanding of any specific gene-drug interactions could potentially optimize dosing and minimize adverse events, enhancing therapeutic outcomes in patients treated with prasugrel.
