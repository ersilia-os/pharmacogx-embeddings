## Drug Summary
Ivosidenib is a first-in-class oral medication predominantly targeting the isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) enzyme, which is frequently mutated in several forms of cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and cholangiocarcinoma. As an IDH1 inhibitor, Ivosidenib plays a role in blocking the aberrant production of the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG), thereby disrupting cellular metabolism and promoting differentiation in malignant cells. Approved by the FDA in July 2018, Ivosidenib is indicated for adults with AML having specific IDH1 mutations and is also approved for treating relapsed or refractory myelodysplastic syndromes and locally advanced/metastatic cholangiocarcinoma. Its pharmacokinetics highlight rapid absorption with a C_max reached within two to three hours post-administration and involves metabolism primarily via the enzyme CYP3A4.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Ivosidenib specifically inhibits the mutated form of IDH1, an enzyme that normally helps convert isocitrate to Î±-ketoglutarate in the citric acid cycle, but when mutated, leads to the accumulation of D-2HG. This inhibition occurs preferentially at mutations found at the R132 position, notably R132H and R132C. In terms of metabolism, Ivosidenib undergoes predominant oxidation by CYP3A4, along with minor pathways including N-dealkylation and hydrolysis. It has also been identified that Ivosidenib is a substrate for the transporter proteins ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) and SLC22A8, which could influence its distribution and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic research on Ivosidenib heavily emphasizes the significance of assessing IDH1 mutations within patient tumors to predict responsiveness to the drug, specifically mutations at the R132 position. This biomarker is crucial for patient selection and determining treatment appropriateness with Ivosidenib. Moreover, variability in patient response and potential toxicities could be modulated by the activity of CYP3A4, which is known for its genetic polymorphisms affecting enzyme activity. Polymorphisms in genes encoding ABCB1 might also influence drug exposure and subsequent clinical outcomes. Studies noting these genetic variations could be pivotal in optimizing dosing strategies and enhancing patient care by minimizing adverse effects while maximizing therapeutic efficacy.
