## Drug Summary
Terbinafine, marketed under the name Lamisil, is a synthetic allylamine antifungal drug extensively employed against various fungal disorders affecting the skin and nails. Specifically, it targets fungal infections due to Trichophyton species, Microsporum canis, Epidermophyton floccosum, Tinea species, and yeast infections by Candida species and Malassezia furfur. Terbinafine operates by inhibiting squalene monooxygenase (also known as squalene epoxidase), a critical enzyme in fungal ergosterol biosynthesis. This inhibition results in the accumulation of squalene, disrupting cell membrane integrity and leading to fungal cell death. Terbinafine is well-absorbed orally but has a systemic bioavailability of about 40% due to first-pass metabolism. It is highly lipophilic, allowing accumulation in skin, nails, and fatty tissues, and showcases a lengthy terminal elimination half-life.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Terbinafine's principal mechanism is the inhibition of the enzyme squalene monooxygenase (target represented by ERG1 in yeast and SQLE in humans), an essential step in ergosterol synthesis for fungal cell walls. Among metabolizing enzymes, terbinafine is predominantly processed by cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP2C9, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and others, which handle its metabolic deamination, hydroxylation, and N-demethylation. Pharmacokinetics reveals that ABC transporter MDR2 in certain fungal strains like Trichophyton may influence drug disposition. Moreover, human proteins like serum albumin (ALB) and alpha1-acid glycoprotein (ORM2) serve as carriers, possibly affecting the drug's distribution and plasma protein binding properties.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of terbinafine involves several cytochrome P450 enzymes which play a significant role in its metabolism. Variability in genes such as CYP2C9, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19 can impact the drug's clearance and, consequently, its efficacy and toxicity. For example, altered function or expression of CYP2C9 alleles might modify terbinafine's metabolic rate, potentially leading to variability in drug concentrations and response among different individuals. Genetic variations in these enzymes could potentially modulate the risk of adverse effects, such as liver function abnormalities, which are a concern with terbinafine therapy. Genetic testing prior to therapy could therefore be beneficial to personalize terbinafine dosages to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize risks, although specific guidelines and mainstream clinical validation in this aspect are currently limited.
