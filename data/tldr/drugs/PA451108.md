## Drug Summary
Procainamide, also known by brand names such as Biocoryl, Procan, and Procapan, is a derivative of procaine primarily used to treat severe ventricular arrhythmias. It works as a sodium channel blocker, aiding in stabilizing neuronal membranes by inhibiting ionic fluxes necessary for impulse initiation and conduction, thus producing its anti-arrhythmic and local anesthetic effects. Procainamide is absorbed with an efficiency of 75 to 95% following administration and predominantly metabolized in the liver. This medication emphasizes its critical use in clinical scenarios such as cardiac surgeries, catheterizations, or conditions including myocardial infarction or digitalis toxicity. 

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Procainamide acts on multiple molecular targets which include potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2 (KCNH2) and sodium channel protein type 5 subunit alpha (SCN5A), which both play vital roles in cardiac electrical activity. Furthermore, it targets DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), affecting DNA methylation processes. The drug is metabolized by enzymes like cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and cholinesterase (BCHE), which contribute to its biotransformation. Concerning the transport of procainamide, it involves various solute carrier family members such as SLC22A1, SLC22A2, SLC22A3, SLC22A4, SLC22A5, and multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins SLC47A1 and SLC47A2, assisting in the drug's renal secretion and hepatic uptake.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic aspects of procainamide are particularly significant concerning its metabolism by CYP2D6, an enzyme known for its polymorphic nature. Variability in CYP2D6 functionality can influence procainamide's plasma levels and, therefore, its therapeutic efficacy and risk of toxicity. Individuals with poor metabolizer phenotypes may experience higher exposures leading to increased risks of drug-induced lupus erythematosus, a well-documented adverse effect of procainamide. Furthermore, evidence suggests that genetic variations in target sodium channels (e.g., SCN5A) could potentially alter the drug's efficacy and safety profile. While specific genetic guidelines for procainamide use based on these targets are not established, ongoing research into these pharmacogenetic interactions could lead to more personalized therapeutic strategies and better management of its clinical use.
