## Drug Summary
Eribulin is a synthetic microtubule inhibitor derived from the marine sponge *Halichondria okadai*. It is primarily used for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have already undergone at least two other chemotherapeutic regimens for metastatic disease. The drug's mechanism centers around the inhibition of microtubule dynamics, preventing the growth phase of microtubules without affecting the shortening phase and leading to the aggregation of tubulin into non-functional clusters. This disruption results in G2/M cell-cycle blockage, malfunctioning mitotic spindles, and eventual apoptotic cell death after prolonged mitotic interference. Eribulin exhibits a linear pharmacodynamic property, and it is minimally metabolized by CYP3A4, with no substantial metabolites detected in human subjects.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Eribulin interacts predominantly with microtubular structures, targeting tubulin beta-1 chain (TUBB1). This interaction leads to the disruption of normal microtubule functions integral for cell division and viability. Additionally, it is identified to interact with the apoptosis regulator Bcl-2 (BCL2), which can influence programmed cell death pathways, potentially enhancing the drug's anti-cancer effects through apoptotic mechanisms. There are no significant enzymes, transporters, or carriers explicitly linked to the pharmacokinetics of eribulin, emphasizing its direct action on microtubule dynamics and apoptosis without extensive systemic mediation through enzymatic or transport systems.

## Pharmacogenetics
Given the information and data available, there are no explicit pharmacogenetic markers linked directly to eribulin response or metabolism identified in the provided resources. However, since eribulin is minimally metabolized by CYP3A4, genetic variations in the CYP3A4 gene might still influence its pharmacokinetics, albeit to a minor degree. Further clinical studies and genetic screenings could potentially elucidate specific genetic factors that could predict patient response or susceptibility to eribulin-induced toxicities, such as peripheral neuropathy, which is a noted adverse effect of the drug. Currently, however, the use of eribulin in patients is primarily guided by clinical criteria rather than pharmacogenetic testing, pending further research in this area.
