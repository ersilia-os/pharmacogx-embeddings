## Drug Summary
Ruxolitinib, commercialized under the name Jakafi among others, is an anticancer drug primarily classified as a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. It exhibits potent and selective inhibition of JAK1 and JAK2, which are crucial for cytokine signaling and regulation of hematopoiesis. Ruxolitinib is indicated for the treatment of intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis, including primary and secondary forms, polycythemia vera in patients who are unresponsive or intolerant to hydroxyurea, and for both acute and chronic steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease. Additionally, its topical form is used in atopic dermatitis and vitiligo. The drug works by blocking the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which is often dysregulated in myeloproliferative neoplasms. It was first approved by the FDA in 2011 for myelofibrosis and subsequently for other indications. Ruxolitinib is generally well-absorbed with high oral bioavailability and achieves peak plasma concentrations within one to two hours after ingestion. It undergoes extensive metabolism predominantly via CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP2C9.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Ruxolitinib targets multiple members of the JAK family including JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. These kinases are integral to the cytokine and growth factor signal transduction, impacting various cellular processes including cell growth and immune function. The inhibition by ruxolitinib consequently leads to reduced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins, thus diminishing gene expression implicated in proliferation and inflammation. Metabolically, ruxolitinib is primarily processed by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. This extensive metabolism involves multiple hydroxylation reactions leading to various metabolites that retain some pharmacologic activity. Additionally, serum albumin (ALB) is noted as a carrier for ruxolitinib, which may influence its distribution and pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of ruxolitinib involves primarily the influence of polymorphisms in the CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 genes on its metabolism. Variants in these genes can alter enzyme activity, potentially affecting the drug's plasma levels, efficacy, and safety profile. In particular, the reduced function alleles of CYP2C9 (e.g., CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3) might lead to decreased metabolism of ruxolitinib, increasing the risk of adverse effects such as myelosuppression. Conversely, individuals with certain CYP3A4 variants associated with enhanced enzymatic activity might have lower drug levels, possibly reducing therapeutic effects. Although not directly linked in clinical guidelines to mandatory genetic testing, assessing these genotypes could inform dose adjustments to optimize therapeutic outcomes, especially in patients displaying atypical responses or increased side effects. Moreover, while mutations like JAK2V617F do not alter the drugâ€™s mechanism, they may confer differential sensitivity or resistance, impacting clinical response variability in myeloproliferative disorders.
