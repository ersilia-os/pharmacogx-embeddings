## Drug Summary
Benzylpenicillin, also known as Penicillin G or Pentids, is a classic narrow-spectrum antibiotic predominantly used to treat infections by susceptible Gram-positive organisms. It belongs to the natural penicillin class, a beta-lactam antibiotic effective in targeting bacterial infections. Due to its sensitivity to stomach acid, it is not orally bioavailable and thus is administered via intravenous or intramuscular injections. The drug exhibits rapid absorption from these routes with transient high initial blood levels. Approximately 16-30% of the drug is metabolized into inactive penicilloic acid, with smaller amounts converted to 6-aminopenicillanic acid and active hydroxylated metabolites, which are all excreted via urine. Neurological and hematological adverse effects like convulsions and neutropenia may occur with high or prolonged dosages.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Benzylpenicillin acts by inhibiting penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), crucial for bacterial cell wall synthesis. Resistance can occur via bacterial beta-lactamases such as TEM found in Escherichia coli, which degrade penicillin. The drugâ€™s transport involves several solute carriers, including SLC22A8, SLC15A1, SLC15A2 (important for kidney reabsorption), SLC22A6, SLC22A5, and various SLCO family members which are involved in its hepatic uptake and biliary excretion. The protein ALB (albumin) also acts as a carrier, potentially impacting drug's distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is currently limited specific pharmacogenetic data in mainstream resources regarding individual variability in response to Benzylpenicillin directly linked to genetic differences in humans. However, inferential genetic considerations can be made regarding expression variations in the solute carriers (e.g., SLC22A5, or OCTN2) and organic anion transporting polypeptides (e.g., SLCO1B1) that could influence the pharmacokinetics of the drug. Genetic polymorphisms in these transporters may affect drug uptake, distribution, and elimination, thereby potentially altering efficacy or toxicity of Benzylpenicillin. Future genetic studies could provide more personalized approaches to dosing and predicting adverse effects based on individual genetic profiles.
