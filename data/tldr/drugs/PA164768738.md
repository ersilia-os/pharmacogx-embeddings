## Drug Summary
Ethionamide, also known by various names such as Ethatyl, Ethide, and Trecator-SC, is a second-line antitubercular agent mainly used to treat tuberculosis (TB) when primary therapies are ineffective. Belonging to the class of nicotinic acid derivatives, Ethionamide is effective against both pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis. The drug is known for its ability to inhibit mycolic acid synthesis, crucial for the bacterial cell wall of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. Ethionamide is administered orally and is essentially completely absorbed with a bioavailability of approximately 100%. It undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism primarily to its active sulfoxide metabolite and several inactive metabolites. The sulphoxide metabolite exhibits antimicrobial activity against *M. tuberculosis*.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Ethionamide acts primarily by interfering with the cell wall synthesis of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, specifically targeting the enzymes inhA (Enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase [NADH]) and katG (Catalase-peroxidase). The mechanism involves the inhibition of inhA, a key enzyme involved in the fatty acid synthesis pathway critical for the bacterial cell wall. Ethionamide, similar to isoniazid, undergoes intracellular modifications and inhibits mycolic acid synthesis. There is currently no information on specific transporters or carriers associated with Ethionamide's action or pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
While the detailed pharmacogenetics profile of Ethionamide is less documented, the drug's effectiveness and resistance patterns can be inferred to be influenced by genetic variations in the target mycobacterial enzymes such as inhA and katG. For instance, mutations in the katG gene of *M. tuberculosis* can confer resistance to isoniazid, and similar mechanisms may exist for Ethionamide given its similar mode of action. In clinical settings, understanding the genetic makeup of the tuberculosis bacteria infecting a patient could guide the use of Ethionamide, particularly in cases of multidrug-resistant TB. No specific human genetic markers are identified that predict patient response or toxicity to Ethionamide. Further research into the pharmacogenomics of Ethionamide could enhance its use in personalized medicine settings.
