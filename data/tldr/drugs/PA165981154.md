## Drug Summary
Afatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the ErbB family of receptors. Marketed under the name Gilotrif, it is primarily used for first-line treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with specific non-resistant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, detected via an FDA-approved test. This drug is effective in inhibiting the growth of lung cancer cells with common EGFR mutations, such as deletions in exon 19 and the L858R substitution in exon 21. Afatinib operates by irreversibly binding to and inhibiting the kinase activity of EGFR and its related family members (HER2, ErbB4), which plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of many cancers. Pharmacokinetically, afatinib has a Tmax of 2-5 hours post oral administration, with a bioavailability of 92%. Enzymatic metabolism of afatinib is minimal, with protein adducts being the major circulating metabolites.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Afatinib specifically targets and irreversibly inhibits the tyrosine kinase domains of EGFR, HER2, and ErbB4. These targets make afatinib effective at blocking the ErbB signaling pathway, which is often aberrantly activated in various cancers, especially NSCLC. Afatinib shows no significant involvement with metabolic enzymes, indicating a primarily non-enzymatic clearance mechanism. However, it is a substrate for the efflux transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2, which may influence its absorption and disposition across cell membranes. The implications of these transporters could be crucial for understanding variations in drug effectiveness and side effects among individuals.

## Pharmacogenetics
Afatinib’s efficacy is highly influenced by specific genetic mutations within the EGFR gene. Polymorphisms such as those encoded by rs121913444, rs121434568, and rs28929495 have been linked to higher response rates to afatinib. These mutations augment the kinase domain, enhancing receptor activation and thus increasing afatinib’s inhibitory efficacy. Additionally, the presence of the T790M mutation, which could occur after initial treatment, heralds acquired resistance to afatinib, steering therapeutic decisions towards other next-line EGFR TKIs. Understanding these genetic factors is crucial for personalized medicine, as they directly impact treatment outcomes and decisions in NSCLC therapy involving afatinib.
