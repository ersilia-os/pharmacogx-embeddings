## Drug Summary
Desmethylnaproxen, also known as 6-desmethylnaproxen, is a major metabolite of naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used for its analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Naproxen itself operates primarily by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which is essential for the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxane, compounds involved in inflammation, pain, and fever mechanisms. Desmethylnaproxen, similarly, is believed to inherit most pharmacological properties of its precursor, although specific pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles may vary somewhat due to differences in molecular structure.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The specific information on the molecular targets, enzymes, transporters, and carriers for desmethylnaproxen is not detailed in available literature distinctly from naproxen. Generalising from naproxen, desmethylnaproxen might also exert effects by modulating the activity of cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2). These enzymes are pivotal in converting arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, which are critical mediators of inflammation and pain. The metabolism of desmethylnaproxen likely follows pathways similar to those of naproxen, predominantly involving hepatic enzymes, although the exact enzymes implicated may differ.

## Pharmacogenetics
Specific pharmacogenetic studies focusing on desmethylnaproxen are sparse or non-existent. However, pharmacogenetic interactions for NSAIDs like naproxen generally involve genes coding for enzymes in the cytochrome P450 system, particularly CYP2C9. Variations in CYP2C9 can affect the metabolic rate of naproxen, potentially altering efficacy and toxicity profiles. Given that desmethylnaproxen is a metabolite of naproxen, mutations or variations in genes encoding metabolic enzymes (such as those in the cytochrome P450 family) could likewise influence its pharmacokinetic behavior, although further detailed studies are required to establish precise pharmacogenetic correlations.
