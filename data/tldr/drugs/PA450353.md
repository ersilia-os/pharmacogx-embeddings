## Drug Summary
Meloxicam, sold under various brand names such as Achefree, Acticam, and many others, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to alleviate pain associated with musculoskeletal disorders, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. It is distinguished by a preferential inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which provides a therapeutic effect with potentially fewer gastrointestinal side effects compared to other NSAIDs. However, this remains a topic of some controversy. Meloxicam exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities, and its pharmacological effects are primarily achieved through the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. The drug can be administered via oral, transdermal, and intravenous routes, and is noted for its enhanced half-life that supports once-daily dosing. It is also indicated for off-label uses such as dental or postsurgical pain relief and has been studied in neuropathic pain scenarios.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Meloxicam acts through the inhibition of prostaglandin synthetase enzymes, specifically COX-1 and COX-2 (prostaglandin G/H synthase 1 and 2), contributing to its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. The drug is metabolized almost completely with CYP2C9 playing a significant role, aided by CYP3A4 and likely CYP2C8. It forms several inactive metabolites, the primary being 5'-carboxy meloxicam. Transport of meloxicam involves multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (ABCC4), and it is also known to bind to serum albumin (ALB), which may influence its distribution and pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of meloxicam is significantly influenced by the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2C9. Variants within the CYP2C9 gene can affect the metabolism of meloxicam, potentially altering its efficacy and safety profile. Individuals with reduced function alleles like CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 may exhibit slower metabolism of meloxicam, which could lead to increased exposure and heightened risk of adverse effects. Additionally, the involvement of CYP3A4 suggests that genetic variants in this enzyme could also impact the pharmacokinetics of meloxicam, although its role is considered secondary to CYP2C9. Careful consideration of these genetic factors is important when prescribing meloxicam, particularly in populations known to carry significant frequencies of these variants.
