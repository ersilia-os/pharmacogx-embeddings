## Drug Summary
Mafenide is a sulfonamide-type antimicrobial agent primarily used for treating severe burns. It is often applied as an adjunctive topical treatment under moist dressings over meshed autografts on excised burn wounds. Originally approved by the FDA in 1998 under its accelerated approval regulations, mafenide acetate was later withdrawn in November 2022 due to unresolved issues from a required confirmatory study. Pharmacokinetically, mafenide is absorbed systemically through devascularized tissues when applied topically. It is metabolized into a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, which is significant for understanding both its efficacy and associated risks, such as metabolic acidosis. Though the exact mechanism of action is not entirely understood, mafenide significantly reduces microbial populations in avascular burn tissues and supports the healing of deep burns.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The known target of mafenide is carbonic anhydrase 6 (CA6), a human enzyme. Mafenide is metabolized into a form that inhibits this enzyme, suggesting its involvement in the drug's action or side effects. Unfortunately, specific details about other enzymes, transporters, or carriers implicated in the action or metabolism of mafenide are not provided in the available resources. The drug's inhibition of carbonic anhydrase may play a part in its effect on wound healing or could primarily relate to the known side effect of metabolic acidosis due to disrupted acid-base balance.

## Pharmacogenetics
Presently, there are no detailed pharmacogenetic data specified for mafenide in the resources provided or commonly available databases. Pharmacogenetic impacts could potentially exist given the metabolic transformation of mafenide to a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and the variability in carbonic anhydrase activity among individuals. However, until detailed genetic studies or clinical pharmacogenetic trials are performed involving mafenide, any discussion on pharmacogenetic associations remains speculative. Monitoring clinical outcomes and adverse effects in diverse patient populations might provide preliminary insights, potentially guiding more tailored treatment strategies or pharmacogenetic investigations in the future.
