## Drug Summary
Sunitinib, sold under the brand name Sutent among others, is a small-molecule multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor approved by the FDA in 2006. Used primarily for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET), it operates by inhibiting multiple RTKs involved in the growth, pathologic angiogenesis, and metastatic progression of tumors. Sunitinib is taken orally, with bioavailability unaffected by food. The drug achieves maximum plasma concentration between 6 to 12 hours post-administration, and its pharmacokinetics are consistent across healthy individuals and patients with solid tumors.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Sunitinib acts by inhibiting several RTKs: PDGFRα, PDGFRβ, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3, KIT, FLT3, CSF1R, and the RET receptor. These kinases play critical roles in cellular signaling pathways that regulate tumor cell growth and angiogenesis. The metabolic degradation of Sunitinib is primarily facilitated by CYP3A4 along with minor contributions from CYP3A5 and CYP3A7, leading to the formation of active metabolites. In regard to transport, Sunitinib and its metabolites interact with several efflux transporters including P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), Multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) 2 (ABCC2), MRP4 (ABCC4), and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP, ABCG2).

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of Sunitinib is particularly notable concerning the genetic polymorphisms of CYP3A4, as these may significantly affect the drug’s toxicity profile. For instance, the polymorphism rs4646437 in CYP3A4 can lead to a higher risk of drug-induced hypertension in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who are treated with Sunitinib. Patients bearing this genetic variant might need adjusted doses or enhanced monitoring for side effects during treatment. These pharmacogenetic factors underscore the importance of genetic screening prior to initiation of therapy with Sunitinib to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects.
