## Drug Summary
Riluzole, marketed under various names such as Rilutek, Fanizan, and Lizorolol, is primarily used in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease. As a member of the benzothiazole class, riluzole functions as a glutamate antagonist and is recognized for its neuroprotective properties in various in vivo models of neuronal injury. The drug's mechanism, although not fully understood, includes inhibition of glutamate release, inactivation of voltage-dependent sodium channels, and interference with intracellular events subsequent to excitatory amino acid receptor activation. Riluzole is well-absorbed orally with about 60% bioavailability, and its absorption is affected by high fat meals. It is extensively metabolized primarily through hepatic enzymes, leading to several major and minor metabolites.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Riluzole interacts with specific molecular targets including the sodium channel protein type 5 subunit alpha (SCN5A) and the cystine/glutamate transporter (SLC7A11). The detailed involvement of these targets contributes significantly to its pharmacological profile. The drug is extensively metabolized by enzymes, predominantly by CYP1A2, and to a lesser extent, possibly involving CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP2E1. The main metabolic processes include hydroxylation and glucuronidation. The transporter protein ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2) is also implicated in the transport mechanisms of riluzole, potentially influencing its pharmacokinetics and distribution within the body.

## Pharmacogenetics
Riluzole metabolism heavily involves the enzyme CYP1A2. Genetic variants within the CYP1A2 gene can significantly affect the enzyme's activity, possibly altering the metabolism of riluzole in affected individuals. This variability can lead to differences in drug levels and responses. While specific pharmacogenetic guidelines or established clinical protocols for riluzole and CYP1A2 variants are not pronounced, understanding the genetic basis of CYP1A2 activity could potentially influence riluzole dosing and therapeutic outcomes. It's important to consider genetic testing in cases where altered drug metabolism is suspected due to unexpected therapeutic responses or adverse effects, although the routine use of such testing for riluzole is not currently standard practice.
