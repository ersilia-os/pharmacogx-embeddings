## Drug Summary
Tianeptine, marketed under various brand names such as Coaxil, Stablon, and others, is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) with a unique profile, different from traditional TCAs. Originally developed and patented in the 1960s by The French Society of Medical Research, this drug primarily treats major depressive disorder and anxiety, with ongoing studies into its potential for managing fibromyalgia pain. Structurally, tianeptine doesn't simply follow the classical monoaminergic hypothesis of depression that attributes efficacy to changing levels of neurotransmitters like serotonin and noradrenaline; its action also involves modulation of glutamate receptor activity, which may alter neural plasticity. It shows high oral bioavailability (99%) and is metabolized mainly by beta-oxidation, with significant renal excretion.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Tianeptineâ€™s pharmacological effect is multifaceted, involving diverse receptors and pathways; contrary to most antidepressants, it acts as a full agonist at the mu-type opioid receptor (OPRM1), which is a target implicated in novel antidepressant actions. Besides, it affects several other receptors including AMPA receptor (GRIA1), serotonin receptor 1A (HTR1A), and dopamine D3 receptor (DRD3). This variety may account for its therapeutic effects spanning both depressive and anxious symptoms. Metabolically, tianeptine is primarily processed by the enzyme cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), highlighting its role in the drug's hepatic transformation. There are no notable interactions with specific transporters or carriers reported.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of tianeptine has not been extensively characterized in clinical or genetic studies, making specific pharmacogenetic interactions largely unknown. However, given the involvement of CYP3A4 in tianeptine metabolism, genetic variants affecting the CYP3A4 enzyme activity could influence tianeptine's pharmacokinetics, potentially altering its efficacy and safety profile. Moreover, since tianeptine acts as a mu-opioid receptor agonist, variations in the OPRM1 gene might also influence responses to the drug, although direct evidence linking these genetic variations to clinical outcomes with tianeptine use is limited and warrants further investigation. Such genetic associations might explain variability in patient responses, potentially guiding more personalized therapeutic approaches.
