## Drug Summary
Fluoxetine is a well-known selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), extensively used since its FDA approval in 1987 for managing various psychiatric conditions. Its therapeutic utility spans across major depressive disorder (both acute and maintenance treatment), obsessive-compulsive disorder, bulimia nervosa, panic disorder, bipolar I disorder (in combination with olanzapine), treatment-resistant depression, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder in female patients. Fluoxetine operates primarily by inhibiting the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT), which boosts serotonin levels in the brain, contributing to its antidepressant effect. It has high oral bioavailability, limited by first-pass metabolism, is lipophilic, and exhibits significant plasma protein binding, influencing its distribution including to the brain. Metabolism of fluoxetine is primarily hepatic, involving conversion to the active metabolite norfluoxetine chiefly through CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Fluoxetineâ€™s principal pharmacological action is the inhibition of SERT (SLC6A4), thereby increasing serotonin levels in neuronal synapses. It also interacts with the 5-HT2C receptors which may enhance noradrenaline and dopamine levels in specific brain regions, contributing to its clinical effects. The metabolism of fluoxetine involves multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5. These enzymes play roles in the N-demethylation and O-dealkylation processes essential for its metabolic breakdown. Additionally, fluoxetine and its metabolite inhibit CYP2D6, impacting drug-drug interactions. It is also a substrate for the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and binds to plasma proteins like serum albumin (ALB) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (ORM1), affecting its pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
Fluoxetine pharmacogenetics is primarily concerned with the variability in response and metabolism mediated by genetic polymorphisms in its metabolizing enzymes. CYP2D6 is a critical enzyme in fluoxetine metabolism, and genetic variations in CYP2D6 can significantly affect the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of the drug. Individuals with multiple copies of the CYP2D6 gene (ultrarapid metabolizers) may require higher doses to achieve therapeutic effects, whereas those with reduced function or nonfunctional alleles (poor metabolizers) may experience higher plasma levels, leading to increased risk of adverse effects at standard doses. Genotyping for CYP2D6 can be beneficial in tailoring fluoxetine therapy to improve efficacy and reduce toxicity. Moreover, since fluoxetine inhibits CYP2D6, it can alter the metabolism of co-administered drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates, necessitating adjustments in dosages of the affected medications to avoid adverse interactions.
