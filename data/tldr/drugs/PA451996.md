## Drug Summary
Azacitidine, also known by trade names Ladakamycin and Mylosar, is a pyrimidine nucleoside analogue of cytidine, used primarily as an anti-neoplastic agent. Approved by the FDA in 2004 for subcutaneous administration and in 2007 for intravenous use, it is primarily indicated for various subtypes of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in specific patient settings. Azacitidine functions both by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, leading to demethylation and reactivation of silenced genes, and by incorporating into RNA and DNA, causing cytotoxic effects that disrupt RNA metabolism and inhibit protein and DNA synthesis. Its pharmacokinetics reveal that azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration, with a relative bioavailability of approximately 89% compared to intravenous administration.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Azacitidine's primary molecular target is DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), where it binds and inhibits this enzyme, contributing to its DNA hypomethylating activity. This action is crucial for its utility in treating diseases characterized by abnormal methylation patterns like MDS and AML. The drug is metabolized primarily through spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination, a process mediated by cytidine deaminase (CDA). Azacitidine metabolism does not involve cytochrome P450 enzymes. Information regarding its specific transporters and carriers has not been provided, suggesting that these may not play a significant role in its pharmacokinetic profile.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors in azacitidine treatment primarily involve its metabolism by cytidine deaminase (CDA). Variability in CDA activity due to genetic differences could potentially influence azacitidine's effectiveness and toxicity, although specific alleles or markers have yet to be definitively linked to clinical outcomes in the literature. Since CDA is responsible for the deamination of azacitidine, polymorphisms in the CDA gene might affect drug levels and responses, making this an area of interest for future pharmacogenetic research. Moreover, genetic variations affecting the expression or function of DNMT1 could also modulate the drug's efficacy, given its central role as a drug target.
