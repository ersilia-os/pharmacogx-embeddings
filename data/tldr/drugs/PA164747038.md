## Drug Summary
Sulfametopyrazine, also known as Kelfizina, is a long-acting sulfonamide antibiotic primarily used for the treatment of respiratory infections like chronic bronchitis, urinary tract infections, and malaria. This drug functions as a bacteriostatic agent with a broad spectrum against both gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. Resistance in one sulfonamide potentially indicates resistance across all sulfonamides due to their similar mechanism of action. Sulfametopyrazine competitively inhibits the incorporation of p-aminobenzoic acid into folic acid, an essential process for bacterial growth and replication. Though sulfonamides can be administered orally with good systemic absorption, their parenteral use is limited due to the highly alkaline and irritating nature of soluble sulfonamide salts. They distribute widely into body tissues, including pleural, peritoneal, synovial, and ocular fluids.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Sulfametopyrazine specifically targets the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase, which is crucial for folic acid synthesis in bacteria. This enzyme, found notably in Plasmodium falciparum (a malaria-causing organism), is competitively inhibited by the drug. This inhibition blocks the microbial folic acid synthesis pathway, rendering the bacteria unable to replicate and ultimately leading to their elimination. This mechanism underscores the process by which sulfametopyrazine exerts its bacteriostatic effects. Information regarding the involvement of specific transporters or carriers in the action or distribution of sulfametopyrazine is not detailed in the provided information.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is no specific pharmacogenetic information provided for Sulfametopyrazine in the DrugBank entry. Typically, pharmacogenetic aspects of sulfonamide antibiotics might involve genetic variations influencing drug metabolism or adverse drug reactions, such as those in the cytochrome P450 enzymes. However, specific genes or variants directly associated with sulfametopyrazine metabolism, efficacy, or toxicity have not been identified or were not included in the available data. As such, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses to sulfametopyrazine could vary based on individual genetic makeup, but more detailed studies would be necessary to identify explicit pharmacogenetic interactions or recommendations.
