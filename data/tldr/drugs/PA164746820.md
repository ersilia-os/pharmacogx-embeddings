## Drug Summary
Fosphenytoin, known commercially as Prodilantin and Sesquient, is a water-soluble prodrug of phenytoin, specifically used in hospital settings for managing epileptic seizures. As a prodrug, fosphenytoin demonstrates improved solubility and is rapidly converted into phenytoin upon administration, enabling effective and controlled management of seizure activity, particularly in emergency scenarios. It is primarily indicated for generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus and pre- or perioperative seizure management during neurosurgery. The drug’s pharmacodynamics link closely to its ability to modulate neuronal sodium channels, stabilizing neuronal membranes and reducing seizure propagation. Its pharmacokinetic properties reveal a rapid conversion from fosphenytoin to phenytoin after intravenous administration, with metabolism primarily facilitated by hepatic enzymes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The main therapeutic action of fosphenytoin is through phenytoin, which targets the SCN5A gene that encodes the sodium channel protein type 5 subunit alpha, playing a crucial role in reducing seizure activity by limiting neuronal firing. In terms of metabolism, fosphenytoin is metabolized into phenytoin chiefly by phosphatases; then phenytoin itself is processed predominantly through CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, along with several other enzymes including CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP3A4, UGT1A6, and UGT1A9. Additionally, it interacts with carriers like serum albumin (ALB) and thyroxine-binding globulin (SERPINA7), which may influence its distribution and efficacy.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, the activity and metabolism of phenytoin (and consequently fosphenytoin) are significantly influenced by genetic variation in enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Variants in CYP2C9 can result in decreased clearance of phenytoin, posing a higher risk of drug toxicity, especially at higher dosages. Similarly, CYP2C19 polymorphisms, particularly the CYP2C19*2 and *3 alleles, can significantly impact the hydroxylation of phenytoin, affecting both the drug's effectiveness and the patient’s risk profile for adverse effects such as toxicity. These genetic variations necessitate careful consideration and dose adjustments to manage the therapeutic levels of phenytoin derived from fosphenytoin, and reinforce the importance of personalized medicine in epilepsy management.
