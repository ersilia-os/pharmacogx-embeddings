## Drug Summary
Haloperidol, marketed under various names like Aloperidin and Serenace, is a high-potency, first-generation antipsychotic medication widely used globally. It exerts its antipsychotic effects primarily through strong antagonism of the dopamine D2 receptors, particularly in the mesolimbic and mesocortical brain systems, which are significant in conditions like schizophrenia and acute psychosis. Haloperidol is indicated for schizophrenia, acute psychosis, Tourette syndrome, severe behavioral problems in children, and off-label for the treatment of chorea and intractable hiccups. It is known for causing less sedation and weight gain compared to other first-generation antipsychotics but has a higher risk of causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Pharmacokinetically, haloperidol exhibits substantial interindividual variability, attributable to its extensive metabolism in the liver and its lipophilic nature.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Haloperidol acts on multiple receptors but chiefly antagonizes the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2), influencing both antipsychotic effects and extrapyramidal side effects. It also affects other receptors like HTR2A, HTR2C, and various adrenergic receptors which contribute to its pharmacodynamic profile. The metabolism of haloperidol is largely governed by cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4, which are crucial in its oxidative metabolism. It is also transformed by UGT1A9 involved in glucuronidation, and CBR1 which reduces haloperidol to its less active forms. Transport-wise, haloperidol is known to be a substrate of P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), influencing its absorption and distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of haloperidol is significantly influenced by the activity of CYP2D6, an enzyme with well-documented genetic polymorphisms. Variants in the CYP2D6 gene can drastically affect the metabolism of haloperidol, leading to differences in drug plasma levels and responses. For example, individuals with reduced CYP2D6 activity (poor metabolizers) may experience higher plasma concentrations of haloperidol, raising the risk of adverse effects like EPS. Conversely, those with multiple copies of the gene (ultra-rapid metabolizers) may metabolize the drug too quickly, potentially reducing its efficacy. Studies suggest inter-ethnic variability in haloperidol metabolism, which might be linked to differential distribution of CYP2D6 variants among populations. This underscores the importance of considering genetic testing in optimizing haloperidol dosing to mitigate side effects and improve therapeutic outcomes.
