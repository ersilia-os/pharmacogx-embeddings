## Drug Summary
Donepezil, marketed under various names including Aricept, Alzepil, and others, is a piperidine derivative that acts as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, primarily used to manage symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease and other forms of dementia such as vascular dementia and Parkinson's disease-associated dementia. FDA-approved since 1996, donepezil is available in oral forms and more recently, as a transdermal delivery system (Adlarity). It works based on the cholinergic hypothesis, suggesting the enhancement of cholinergic transmission alleviates symptoms associated with Alzheimer's cognitive decline. Donepezil is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, possesses a bioavailability of 100%, and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism primarily involving CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary mechanism of action for donepezil involves the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (ACHE), which leads to increased levels of acetylcholine in the central nervous system. This drug also targets various NMDA receptors (GRIN subfamilies) which might play a role in modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission. There is an indication of potential interaction with other targets, like brain-specific nitric oxide synthase (NOS1), and elements of the inflammatory pathway such as TNFAIP6 and NF-kappa-B (NFKB1 and NFKB2). Metabolism of donepezil involves several cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9. The ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCG2 (involved in drug transport across cell membranes) is the major transporter associated with donepezil.

## Pharmacogenetics
Donepezilâ€™s effectiveness and metabolism can be influenced by genetic factors. Particularly, variations in the CYP2D6 gene have a significant impact, which is crucial for the drug's metabolism. An example of such genetic influence is observed with the CYP2D6 rs1080985 variant; individuals carrying this variant have been shown to have a decreased likelihood of responding to donepezil in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. This pharmacogenetic information could be crucial for personalizing treatment plans, potentially guiding the choice of therapeutic strategies to optimize efficacy and minimize adverse effects in treating dementia. Further studies and clinical validation of these genetic associations are essential for confirming these relationships and broadening the scope of precision medicine in Alzheimer's therapy.
