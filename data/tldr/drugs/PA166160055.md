## Drug Summary
Cholic Acid is a major primary bile acid produced in the liver and typically conjugated with glycine or taurine to aid in fat absorption and cholesterol excretion. It is also synthetically formulated as Cholbam capsules, approved by the United States FDA to treat bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects and adjunctively for peroxisomal disorders such as Zellweger syndrome, manifesting liver disease, steatorrhea, or complications from decreased fat-soluble vitamin absorption. While detailed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties are not specified in the provided data, Cholic Acid plays a crucial role in the digestion and absorption process by emulsifying fats and promoting essential fat-soluble vitamins and nutrients' absorption in the intestines.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Cholic Acid interfaces with various proteins that influence its functional and therapeutic effects. Targets include a broad array of cytochrome c oxidase subunits (e.g., COX4I1, MT-CO1, MT-CO2), which play roles in cellular energy production; Estrogen-related receptor gamma (ESRRG), which may influence metabolic pathways; and the Bile acid receptor (NR1H4) and G-protein coupled bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1), both essential for metabolic regulation and bile acid signaling. Notable transporters involved with Cholic Acid are ABCB11 (Bile salt export pump), crucial for bile acid efflux from liver cells, and various members of the SLCO and SLC families (e.g., SLCO1B1, SLC10A1), which mediate the hepatic uptake and intestinal reabsorption of bile acids. The carrier FABP1 (Fatty acid-binding protein, liver) also has a role in its intra-cellular transport.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic interactions of Cholic Acid primarily involve genes related to its transport and metabolism pathways. Variants in genes encoding bile acid transporters such as ABCB11 and those belonging to the SLCO and SLC families might impact the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of Cholic Acid. For example, mutations in ABCB11 are associated with cholestasis and other liver diseases which could be exacerbated or ameliorated by Cholic Acid therapy depending on the mutation's nature. Additionally, receptors like NR1H4 and GPBAR1, which are influenced by genetic variations, could alter an individual's response to bile acid therapy. Although detailed pharmacogenomic data is not provided in this summary, these genetic factors are crucial in personalizing Cholic Acid treatment, reducing adverse effects, and increasing the likelihood of successful therapy.
