## Drug Summary
Methimazole, also marketed under various names such as Danantizol, Favistan, and Thyrozol, belongs to the thionamide class of antithyroid agents. It functions by inhibiting the synthesis of thyroid hormones, specifically by interfering with the enzyme thyroid peroxidase (TPO). First introduced in 1949, methimazole is predominantly used in the management of hyperthyroidism, especially for patients who are not suitable candidates for surgery or radioactive iodine therapy. Methimazole shows a rapid onset of action within 12 to 18 hours, and its effects last between 36 to 72 hours. It is primarily metabolized in the liver, involving various cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, with its metabolites possibly contributing to both its efficacy and toxicity.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Methimazole's primary target is thyroid peroxidase (TPO), a key enzyme in thyroid hormone biosynthesis. Its action may involve behaving as a competitive substrate for TPO, hindering iodination processes necessary for hormone production. Regarding metabolism, methimazole engages several hepatic enzymes, prominently including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, and FMO3. This extensive involvement of CYP enzymes implies substantial hepatic processing and possible interactions with other drugs metabolized via similar pathways. No specific transporters or carriers are identified in the provided data.

## Pharmacogenetics
Methimazole pharmacogenetics mainly revolves around its metabolism by numerous CYP enzymes, which are known to exhibit considerable genetic polymorphism affecting drug metabolism rates and associated adverse effect risks. Genetic variations in these enzymes could influence individual responses to methimazole, potentially affecting efficacy and toxicity. Particularly, polymorphisms in CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 might impact the drug's metabolic rate, leading to variations in drug levels and response. No direct pharmacogenetic testing guidelines for methimazole have been established yet, but considering the role of these enzymes, genetic testing might be relevant in cases of unusual responses or adverse effects. Further research might elucidate more concrete pharmacogenetic associations.
