## Drug Summary
2-Hydroxyatorvastatin is an active metabolite of atorvastatin, a widely-used statin medication primarily prescribed for lowering blood cholesterol and preventing cardiovascular disease. Atorvastatin itself belongs to the therapeutic class of statins or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, which work by inhibiting the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. The metabolic transformation of atorvastatin to 2-hydroxyatorvastatin involves cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP3A4. This metabolite retains pharmacodynamic properties similar to its parent compound, contributing to the overall lipid-lowering effect.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Since 2-hydroxyatorvastatin is a metabolite of atorvastatin, it shares similar targets, primarily the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. This enzyme is crucial in the mevalonate pathway, responsible for cholesterol synthesis. The inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by 2-hydroxyatorvastatin results in a decrease in intrahepatic cholesterol synthesis and an upregulation of LDL receptors, thereby reducing circulating LDL cholesterol. The primary enzyme involved in the metabolism of atorvastatin to 2-hydroxyatorvastatin is CYP3A4. Transporters and carriers specific to 2-hydroxyatorvastatin are not well-documented but could involve hepatic uptake transporters involved in statin pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of 2-hydroxyatorvastatin largely mirrors that of its parent drug, atorvastatin, particularly concerning the influence of CYP3A4 activity. Genetic polymorphisms in CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of atorvastatin, leading to variations in concentrations of 2-hydroxyatorvastatin. Individuals with certain polymorphic variants exhibit different metabolic capacities, impacting drug efficacy and safety. Additionally, variations in the transporter gene SLCO1B1, which encodes the hepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1, are known to affect statin pharmacokinetics and risk of adverse effects such as myopathy. While direct studies on 2-hydroxyatorvastatin are limited, these pharmacogenetic considerations are critical for optimizing therapeutic outcomes and minimizing risks in atorvastatin therapy.
