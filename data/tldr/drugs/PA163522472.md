## Drug Summary
Darunavir, a prototypical protease inhibitor, is crucial in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Used in combination with ritonavir and other antiretroviral agents, it is approved to treat HIV-1 among adults and children aged three years or older. Darunavir binds to the active site of the HIV-1 protease enzyme, preventing the cleavage of viral proteins necessary for mature virus production, effectively inhibiting viral replication. Its absorption is significantly enhanced when taken with food, and it achieves its peak concentrations 2.4 to 4 hours post-administration. Darunavir's oral bioavailability increases notably when co-administered with ritonavir, and its metabolism primarily involves oxidation processes mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes, mainly CYP3A.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Darunavir targets the HIV-1 protease, a crucial enzyme for virus maturation and replication. Regarding metabolism, it predominantly involves enzymes like CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP2D6, which are responsible for its oxidative biotransformation. Darunavir utilizes transporters such as SLCO1B1 and ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), which might affect its pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution. Finally, its interaction with carriers such as serum albumin (ALB) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1) influences its distribution and plasma protein binding, critical for its overall pharmacokinetic profile.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors play a significant role in the efficacy and safety of darunavir therapy. Variants in the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 genes are known to influence darunavir metabolism. Individuals with genetic polymorphisms leading to decreased CYP3A4 activity may experience higher concentrations of darunavir, potentially increasing the risk of drug-related toxicity. Conversely, those with enhanced CYP3A4 activity might have reduced therapeutic effects. Interactions with ABCB1 genetic variants could also affect darunavir's distribution and elimination, impacting its effectiveness and side effect profile. This underlines the importance of considering genetic factors in the dosing and management of darunavir treatment to optimize therapeutic outcomes and reduce adverse effects.
