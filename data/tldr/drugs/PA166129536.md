## Drug Summary

Regadenoson, identified in DrugBank with the ID DB06213, is a selective A2A adenosine receptor agonist primarily used as a diagnostic agent for radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). This pharmacological agent facilitates coronary vasodilation to enhance the differentiation between stenotic and normal coronary arteries during imaging procedures. Approved by the FDA on April 10, 2008, and manufactured by Astellas, it offers a rapid onset of action, typically achieving peak plasma concentrations within 1 to 3 minutes post-injection. Its mechanism involves mimicking adenosine's effects, causing increased coronary blood flow which is particularly useful in identifying areas with potential blockages.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers

The pharmacological action of Regadenoson is mediated through its role as an agonist of the A2A adenosine receptor, denoted by the gene symbol ADORA2A. This receptor plays a crucial role in coronary vasodilation. The drug specifically binds with low affinity to this receptor, thereby inducing a significant increase in myocardial blood flow but not affecting blood flow in stenotic arteries as markedly. This selectivity helps in imaging applications by allowing for better visualization of areas with reduced blood flow due to arterial blockages. Regadenoson does not significantly interact with other adenosine receptors such as A1, A2B, and A3, which limits its effects to desired areas and minimizes potential side effects. There are no known primary enzymes, transporters, or carriers involved in the metabolism or transport of Regadenoson as per the provided DrugBank data.

## Pharmacogenetics

Regarding pharmacogenetics, the influence of genetic variation on the efficacy and safety of Regadenoson is not extensively documented. Given that its primary target is the ADORA2A receptor, genetic variations in the ADORA2A gene could theoretically affect the drug’s efficacy or safety profile, although specific associations in clinical settings are not cited in the DrugBank entry. Additionally, the metabolism of Regadenoson appears not to involve the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, which is often a focus of pharmacogenetic studies due to its genetic variability. Thus, the impact of genetic differences in cytochrome P450 on Regadenoson’s activity is likely minimal. Further research into ADORA2A genetic variations could provide insights into differential responses among patients, potentially guiding more personalized approaches in diagnostic imaging procedures involving this agent.
