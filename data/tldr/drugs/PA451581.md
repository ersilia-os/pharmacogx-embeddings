## Drug Summary
Tamoxifen is a widely used non-steroidal antiestrogen effective primarily against estrogen receptor positive breast cancers. It functions by competitively inhibiting estrogen binding to its receptors, particularly Estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and Estrogen receptors beta (ESR2), thereby diminishing estrogen-driven tumor proliferation. Approved by the FDA in 1977, it is indicated for the management of metastatic breast cancer, as adjuvant therapy in early-stage breast cancer, and to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer following surgery and radiation in cases of ductal carcinoma in situ. The drug is absorbed orally with its active metabolite N-desmethyltamoxifen showing a prolonged half-life, indicating sustained activity. Despite its effectiveness, tamoxifen is associated with certain adverse effects, such as an increased risk of uterine malignancies and potential cardiovascular issues due to its complex metabolic pathway that involves several cytochrome P450 enzymes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Tamoxifen acts on multiple molecular targets including ESR1 and ESR2, multiple isoforms of Protein kinase C (PRKC), and Modulates Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels which affects the bioavailability of estrogens. It is metabolized predominantly in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 into several active metabolites including the potent endoxifen. Other involved enzymes include CYP1A1, CYP2C9, and others that contribute to its complex pharmacokinetic profile. Transporters such as P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and ATP-binding cassette transporters like ABCG2 also play roles in the pharmacokinetics of tamoxifen, influencing its distribution and excretion. Carriers such as Serum albumin (ALB) and Thyroxine-binding globulin (SERPINA7) are essential for its systemic transport.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of tamoxifen is pivotal in its therapeutic efficacy and safety. Polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 enzyme, specifically the rs3892097 variant, significantly influence tamoxifen metabolism. Individuals with reduced function or non-functional alleles of this gene exhibit poor conversion of tamoxifen to its active metabolite, endoxifen, leading to less effective therapy. This has arms for personalized medicine, suggesting genotype-guided dosing might improve outcomes. Additionally, variant rs6025 in the Factor V (F5) gene is linked with a higher risk of thromboembolic events during tamoxifen therapy, recommending vigilance in patients with this genetic background. These pharmacogenetic factors are essential for optimizing tamoxifen use, enhancing its therapeutic effects while minimizing risks.
