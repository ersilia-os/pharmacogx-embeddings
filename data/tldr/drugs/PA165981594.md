## Drug Summary
Eltrombopag, marketed under the names Promacta in the US and Revolade in other countries, is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, specifically designed to increase platelet production in the bone marrow. This pharmaceutical agent is chiefly used to treat chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults when other treatments or surgeries have failed to adequately increase platelet counts. Additionally, it has been approved for treating thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic hepatitis C to facilitate the initiation and maintenance of interferon-based therapy. Eltrombopag differs from agents that attempt to decrease platelet destruction and is administered orally. It reaches peak absorption within 2-6 hours, with a total oral absorption rate of at least 52% following a 75 mg dose.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Eltrombopag acts as a TPO-receptor agonist and interacts with the transmembrane domain of the human thrombopoietin receptor (MPL). This interaction stimulates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, enhancing platelet production without activating the AKT pathway. Metabolism of eltrombopag occurs predominantly via cleavage, oxidation, and conjugation processes, involving enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C8, UGT1A1, UGT1A3, and UGT1A9. It also involves transporters like SLCO1B1 and ABCG2, which assist in drug disposition, but there are no specified carriers in the provided data.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics aspects of eltrombopag reveal notable genetic associations related to increased risks of thromboembolism among specific patient groups. Polymorphisms in genes like Factor V (F5) and SERPINC1 (antithrombin III) have been associated with an elevated risk of thromboembolic events in patients treated with eltrombopag. The rs6025 polymorphism in F5 and rs121909567 in SERPINC1 are particularly implicated. These genetic markers can potentially guide personalized treatment plans and risk assessment strategies, allowing for more tailored and safer patient management, especially in monitoring for the adverse effect of thromboembolism during therapy.
