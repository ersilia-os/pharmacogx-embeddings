## Drug Summary
Ziprasidone, a second-generation or "atypical" antipsychotic, is utilized to address psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and various facets of bipolar I disorder, including acute manic or mixed episodes, and as maintenance therapy in combination with either lithium or valproate. This drug distinguishes itself within its class for having a high 5-HT2A/D2 receptor affinity ratio, which contributes to its efficacy in managing mood disorders, relieving negative symptoms, and improving cognition with reduced risks of extrapyramidal and metabolic side effects. The drug's optimal absorption is significantly enhanced when taken with a meal, predominantly due to prolonged gastric retention. Metabolism involves predominant oxidation and reduction pathways including action by aldehyde oxidase and CYP3A4, with less than 5% excretion as unchanged drug.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Ziprasidone acts primarily upon a variety of dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors. It targets multiple serotonin receptors ((5HT1A, 5HT1D, 5HT2A, 5HT2C, and others), and dopamine receptors (D2, D1, D3, D4, D5), exhibiting a unique receptor binding profile. It also interacts with other neurotransmitter receptors, including histaminergic and cholinergic, albeit with lower affinity. Its enzymatic metabolism is mainly catalyzed by aldehyde oxidase and CYP3A4, which could influence its plasma levels and efficacy. The drug also interacts with transporters like P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and is carried by proteins such as serum albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein.

## Pharmacogenetics
Regarding pharmacogenetics, polymorphisms in metabolic enzymes like CYP3A4 and possibly aldehyde oxidase might affect the pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone, although specific alleles with clinical outcomes are not well defined in the literature. Genetic variations in targets such as dopamine and serotonin receptors (e.g., DRD2, HTR2A) could influence individual responses to the drug, affecting efficacy and side effect profiles. Furthermore, variability in ABCB1, which may affect the drugâ€™s transport across the blood-brain barrier, could potentially modify drug response or side effects. Clinical genetic testing might guide more personalized dosing strategies or aid in predicting side effect risks, though guidelines specific to ziprasidone are not fully established. Further research and clinical correlation of genetic data are necessary to enhance the precision of ziprasidone therapies based on individual genotypes.
