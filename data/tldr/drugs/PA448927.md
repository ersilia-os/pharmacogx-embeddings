## Drug Summary
Chloramphenicol, known under various names including Brochlor, Chloramex, and Chlorsig, is a broad-spectrum antibiotic initially derived from the bacterium *Streptomyces venezuelae* and now synthetically produced. It acts mainly bacteriostatically by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. However, its uses have been overshadowed by serious side effects such as aplastic anemia, particularly with oral administration, which has been withdrawn by the FDA for this route. The drug is now predominantly reserved for severe infections like typhoid fever, and for local treatments such as ophthalmic applications in bacterial conjunctivitis. Chloramphenicol is rapidly absorbed with an oral bioavailability of approximately 80% and is primarily metabolized in the liver with 90% being conjugated to inactive glucuronides.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Chloramphenicol targets bacterial ribosome protein L16 (rplP) in *Escherichia coli* by binding and blocking peptidyl transferase activity, effectively inhibiting microbial protein synthesis. It also interacts with human cellular component CD55 (Complement decay-accelerating factor) and is enzymatically processed by a variety of enzymes including multiple forms of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase found in different bacteria, which act to inactivate the drug. In humans, the major enzymes involved in its metabolism include CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7, reflecting a diverse metabolic pathway predominantly taking place in hepatic cells. The drug is also transported by human solute carrier family 22 member 6 (SLC22A6).

## Pharmacogenetics
Chloramphenicol's metabolism predominantly by cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 indicates significant pharmacogenetic implications. Genotypic variations in these enzymes can lead to differences in drug metabolism rates among individuals, influencing both the efficacy and toxicity of chloramphenicol. SLC22A6, involved in its transportation, also suggests possible variability in drug handling based on genetic variants of this transporter. Given the drug's narrow therapeutic index and potential for severe toxicities like aplastic anemia, understanding these pharmacogenetic factors is crucial in tailoring safer and more effective dosing regimens for those who still require this antibiotic for severe infections, albeit increasingly rarely.
