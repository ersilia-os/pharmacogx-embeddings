## Drug Summary
Methotrexate (MTX), variously marketed under names such as Rheumatrex, Trexall, and others, is a folate derivative that primarily acts by inhibiting enzymes necessary for DNA synthesis, making it effective in treating diseases characterized by rapid cell proliferation, including various cancers and autoimmune conditions. It is commonly used for treating severe psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and various types of cancers like breast cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. MTX has a complex pharmacokinetic profile, with a bioavailability that can range widely and is reduced with increasing doses due to the saturation of transport mechanisms. Its mechanism allows it to interfere with the growth of certain cells, particularly those which are rapidly dividing, and it exerts significant anti-inflammatory effects in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Methotrexate targets multiple enzymes such as dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), thymidylate synthase (TYMS), and other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis like AICART and ATIC, which are crucial for DNA synthesis and hence affect cell division and growth. It undergoes metabolism predominantly in the liver, involving enzymes such as AOX1, DHFR, MTHFR, TYMS, and FPGS. Notable transport mechanisms include its uptake and efflux mediated by various transporters like ABCB1, ABCC1-4, ABCC10, and SLC family members (e.g., SLC22A6, SLC22A8, SLCO1B1). Serum albumin (ALB) functions as a carrier, affecting its distribution and half-life.

## Pharmacogenetics
Methotrexateâ€™s response and toxicity are influenced by genetic variations, which have substantial implications for its use, necessitating pharmacogenetic consideration. Variants in the MTHFR gene, particularly rs1801133 (C677T polymorphism), have been associated with increased toxicity, likely due to reduced enzyme activity leading to higher levels of MTX polyglutamates. Additionally, variants in the ABCC2 gene are linked to variations in drug transport and consequently methotrexate toxicity, impacting efflux and cellular levels of the drug. These genetic insights are pivotal in guiding dose adjustments and therapy decisions to mitigate risks and improve efficacy in individual patients.
