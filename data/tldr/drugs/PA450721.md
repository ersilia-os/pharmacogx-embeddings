## Drug Summary

Oseltamivir, marketed as TamifluÂ®, is an antiviral medication that functions as a neuraminidase inhibitor, predominantly used for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A and B infections. It is most effective when administered within 48 hours of symptom onset but can be prescribed beyond this timeframe for severe cases or high-risk patients, such as the elderly, children under two years, or those with chronic illnesses. Oseltamivir is a prodrug; it is metabolized in the liver to its active form, oseltamivir carboxylate, which inhibits viral neuraminidase enzyme activity essential for viral particle release from infected cells. Despite its benefits in reducing symptoms and potentially lowering complications from influenza, its overall efficacy and cost-effectiveness have been subjects of debate.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers

The primary target of oseltamivir is the neuraminidase (NA) on the surface of influenza viruses, crucial for viral replication and infectivity. Additionally, it might interact with human sialidases NEU1 and NEU2, though the clinical relevance of these interactions remains unclear. Oseltamivir is metabolized into its active form mainly by liver carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) enzyme. The transport systems involved with oseltamivir include multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (ABCC4), solute carrier family 15 member 1 (SLC15A1), and solute carrier family 22 member 8 (SLC22A8), which could influence the drug's distribution and excretion, although their precise roles in its pharmacokinetics are not fully established.

## Pharmacogenetics

The pharmacogenetics of oseltamivir is mainly concerned with the activity of CES1, as genetic variations in this enzyme could impact the drug's activation and subsequent efficacy. Variants in CES1 could influence the rate at which oseltamivir is converted to its active metabolite, potentially altering therapeutic outcomes. Polymorphisms in genes encoding the transport proteins like ABCC4 could also modify the drug's pharmacokinetics, affecting the drug levels and possibly leading to variations in response or increased side effects. However, detailed studies and clinical data linking specific genetic variants with oseltamivir outcomes remain limited, and this is an area requiring further research.
