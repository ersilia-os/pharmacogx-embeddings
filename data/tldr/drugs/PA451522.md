## Drug Summary
Succinylcholine, also known by brand names Scoline and Sucostrin, is a depolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant. It is structurally composed of two acetylcholine molecules linked by their acetyl groups and has been in use for over 50 years. It is particularly noted for its rapid onset and short duration of action, typically beginning within 60 seconds and lasting about four to six minutes when administered intravenously. This makes it especially useful in facilitating tracheal intubation and providing muscle relaxation during short surgical procedures or mechanical ventilation. The drug is metabolized quickly in the bloodstream by plasma cholinesterase into succinylmonocholine and then into succinic acid and choline.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Succinylcholine acts primarily on the neuronal acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits, targeting multiple subunits including CHRNA2, CHRNA3, CHRNA4, CHRNA5, CHRNA6, CHRNA7, CHRNA9, CHRNB2, CHRNB3, CHRNB4 as well as muscarinic receptors CHRM2 and CHRM3. These receptors are located on motor endplates and play critical roles in neuromuscular transmission. Upon binding, succinylcholine mimics acetylcholine but instead of being rapidly degraded, it causes a prolonged depolarization leading to muscle paralysis. The drug is primarily metabolized by butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE), an enzyme in the plasma, which rapidly breaks down succinylcholine into less active metabolites.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic aspects of succinylcholine are particularly relevant concerning the BCHE gene, which encodes the enzyme butyrylcholinesterase responsible for the drug's metabolism. Variants of the BCHE gene can lead to atypical cholinesterase enzyme versions that are either deficient or have reduced activity, substantially prolonging the action of succinylcholine and increasing risks of prolonged respiratory paralysis and other complications. Genetic testing may be considered in individuals known to experience unusual or prolonged recovery from succinylcholine administration or in those with a family history of such responses. Additionally, certain muscular disorders like Duchenne's muscular dystrophy may exacerbate succinylcholine's side effects, including potentially lethal hyperkalemia, which calls for cautious use and often avoidance of this drug in pediatric populations or individuals suspected of having undiagnosed myopathies.
