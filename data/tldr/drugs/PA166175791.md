## Drug Summary
Cannabidiol (CBD) is a major phytocannabinoid from the Cannabis plant, representing up to 40% of its extract. Unlike its counterpart tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), CBD does not cause psychoactive effects. It is notable for a wide range of potential therapeutic effects including analgesic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, anxiolytic, antipsychotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities. CBD operates through multiple receptors and pathways, which explains its varied potential applications. It has garnered much interest for its use in managing conditions such as anxiety, epilepsy, and inflammatory diseases. CBD is metabolized primarily in the liver, involving cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYPs), particularly CYP3A4 and CYP2C19. It is available in formulations like Sativex (combined with THC) and Epidiolex (pure CBD), which are used for conditions like multiple sclerosis spasticity, neuropathic pain, and severe forms of epilepsy.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
CBD interacts with a broad range of molecular targets. It acts as a negative allosteric modulator at cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, and also interacts with G-protein coupled receptors such as GPR55 and GPR18. In addition, CBD influences various ion channels, including TRPV1 and glycine receptors, and impacts serotonin (5-HT) receptors, contributing to its anxiolytic and potential antipsychotic effects. As for metabolism, it is processed by several enzymes like CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and others. This extensive enzymatic involvement indicates significant potential for drug-drug interactions. Transport-wise, CBD influences ABC and SLC transporter families, affecting drug distribution and excretion.

## Pharmacogenetics
Genetic variants impacting CYP450 enzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 can influence CBD's metabolism, affecting both its efficacy and safety profile. Individuals with polymorphisms in these enzymes may experience altered CBD levels, necessitating dose adjustments. Besides metabolic enzymes, genetic variations in target receptors like CNR1 and CNR2 (cannabinoid receptors) or serotonin receptors could modify the therapeutic responses or side effects profile of CBD. Research in this area is ongoing, with growing evidence supporting the significance of pharmacogenetic considerations in optimizing CBD therapy tailored to individual genetic makeups. 

Given the broad range of interactions and pathways involved in CBD's action, further pharmacogenetic studies might elucidate additional genetic factors influencing its pharmacodynamics and therapeutic outcomes, potentially guiding more personalized therapeutic approaches in the future.
