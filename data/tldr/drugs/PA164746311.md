## Drug Summary
Everolimus, identified as DrugBank ID DB01590 and PharmGKB ID PA164746311, is a derivative of Rapamycin (sirolimus) and functions similarly as an mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor, focusing on mTORC1 and not mTORC2. Itâ€™s primarily used as an immunosuppressant in organ transplant recipients to prevent rejection. Proven therapeutic indications for everolimus include treatments for postmenopausal women with advanced hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer in combination with exemestane; progressive neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin; advanced renal cell carcinoma after other treatments have failed; renal angiomyolipoma and tuberous sclerosis complex not requiring immediate surgery; and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma in tuberous sclerosis complex patients. Everolimus is administered orally, reaching peak concentrations between 1 to 2 hours after dosing. Metabolism occurs primarily through CYP3A4, leading to various detectable metabolites in human blood.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Everolimus acts by binding to the FK506 binding protein-12 (FKBP-12), forming a drug complex that inhibits the activation of mTOR. This specifically blocks cell progression from G1 into S phase, inducing cell growth arrest and apoptosis. It also reduces angiogenesis and glucose uptake by decreasing vascular endothelial growth factor expression. The drug is metabolized mainly through cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4 and to a lesser degree by CYP2D6. It's a substrate of multiple transporters: P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1) and solute carrier family members SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, and SLCO1A2, which may impact its distribution and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors can significantly influence the response and toxicity profile of everolimus. It is metabolized by CYP3A4, an enzyme known for its genetic variability, which can affect everolimus plasma levels and its clinical efficacy and safety. Specific polymorphisms in the CYP3A4 gene can lead to variations in the metabolic rate. Since everolimus is also a substrate for ABCB1, polymorphisms in this gene could potentially alter drug absorption and disposition. Variability in these genes may necessitate dose adjustments or careful monitoring in different individuals to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects. While direct pharmacogenetic guidelines for everolimus are not extensively detailed in the literature, considering the implications of variations in these enzymes and transporters is crucial for personalized medication strategies.
