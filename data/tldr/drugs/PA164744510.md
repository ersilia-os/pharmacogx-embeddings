## Drug Summary
Lofexidine, also marketed as Britlofex, is a non-opioid medication primarily used for the mitigation of symptoms associated with acute opioid withdrawal and to facilitate the completion of opioid discontinuation treatment. First approved in the United Kingdom in 1992 and later by the FDA in 2018, lofexidine acts centrally as an alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist. It was initially explored as an antihypertensive but was found less effective compared to clonidine. Lofexidine helps alleviate symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea during opioid withdrawal by moderating the increase in norepinephrine caused by sudden opioid cessation. The drug achieves peak plasma concentrations within 2-5 hours of oral administration and has a bioavailability higher than 72%.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Lofexidine primarily targets the alpha-2A adrenergic receptor (ADRA2A), where it acts as an agonist to inhibit norepinephrine release, thus easing withdrawal symptoms. It also has moderate affinity for receptors such as Alpha-1A adrenergic (ADRA1A), 5-HT1a (HTR1A), 5-HT7 (HTR7), 5HT2c (HTR2C), and 5HT1d (HTR1D), potentially contributing to its effects on mood and visceral functions during withdrawal. Metabolically, lofexidine is chiefly processed by cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP2D6, with minor involvement from CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, leading to the formation of several inactive metabolites. Concerning transport mechanisms, lofexidine is handled by ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 5 (ABCB5) and multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (SLC47A1), which could influence its disposition and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of lofexidine primarily involves CYP2D6, a highly polymorphic enzyme that significantly impacts the drug's metabolism. Variability in CYP2D6 activity due to genetic polymorphisms can lead to different metabolic rates among individuals, affecting drug efficacy and safety. Poor metabolizers (with reduced CYP2D6 function) might experience higher plasma concentrations of lofexidine, potentially leading to increased efficacy or adverse reactions, whereas rapid metabolizers (with enhanced CYP2D6 function) could have reduced drug levels and possibly lesser withdrawal symptom relief. There is a lack of direct pharmacogenomic data linking specific genetic variations with clinical outcomes for lofexidine, and thus, an inferred impact based on known CYP2D6 interactions with other substrates might guide personalized dosing or monitoring strategies.
