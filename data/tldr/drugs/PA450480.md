## Drug Summary
Metoprolol, known under various brand names such as Corvitol, Minax, Selokeen, and TOPROL-XL, is a beta-1-selective adrenergic receptor blocker primarily used to manage cardiac conditions including hypertension, angina, heart failure, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter. It is available in both immediate-release and extended-release formulations, employing succinate and tartrate derivatives respectively, to modify systemic bioavailability and duration of action. The drug operates by diminishing heart rate, cardiac output, and myocardial oxygen demand, which is beneficial in the management of arrhythmias by reducing pacemaker potential slopes and slowing atrioventricular conduction. Developed in 1969 and FDA-approved in 1978, metoprolol remains a preferred beta-blocker in clinical settings.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Metoprolol acts primarily on the beta-1 adrenergic receptors (ADRB1) with minimal impact on beta-2 receptors (ADRB2), exerting its anti-hypertensive and anti-arrhythmic effects by selective inhibition. It also interacts to a lesser extent with other beta-adrenergic receptors such as ADRB3. The metabolism of metoprolol is significantly mediated by the liver enzyme CYP2D6 and to a minor extent by CYP3A4, which are responsible for its hydroxylation and O-demethylation. Additionally, metoprolol is a substrate for the solute carrier transporter SLC22A2 and is bound in circulation by serum albumin (ALB), which may influence its distribution and clearance.

## Pharmacogenetics
Metoprolol pharmacogenetics highlights the role of genetic variations influencing its metabolism and efficacy. The presence of specific alleles in CYP2D6 (e.g., the rs3892097 variant) can lead to reduced metabolic activity, affecting the drug's plasma levels and efficacy, making dosage adjustments necessary for individuals with these genotypes. Additionally, genetic polymorphisms in the ADRB1 receptor, such as rs1801252 and rs1801253, have been noted to significantly alter the therapeutic response, where certain genotypes experience a greater reduction in blood pressure. This genetic variability necessitates consideration of individual genetic profiles to optimize metoprolol therapy, ensuring both efficacy and safety in diverse patient populations.
