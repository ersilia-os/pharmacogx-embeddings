## Drug Summary
Amiodarone is a benzofuran derivative and a class III antiarrhythmic agent renowned for its efficacy in treating severe and life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, particularly ventricular fibrillation and hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia. Approved by the FDA solely for these indications, amiodarone is also commonly used off-label for managing atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardia. The drug operates by prolonging the duration of cardiac action potential and effective refractory period, thus reducing myocardial excitability. Other effects include modulation of smooth muscle function in blood vessels and alterations in thyroid hormone function due to its iodine content. Amiodarone has highly variable absorption affected by food intake, with a bioavailability ranging from 35 to 65%. It is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 enzymes to its main metabolite, desethylamiodarone (DEA).

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Amiodarone targets multiple cardiac ion channels, including KCNH2, KCNH6, and KCNH7 (HERG human cardiac K+ channels), which are crucial for cardiac repolarization. It also impacts various subunits of the voltage-gated L-type calcium channels (e.g., CACNA1C, CACNA1D, CACNA1F, CACNA1I, CACNA1S) and beta-adrenergic receptors (ADRB1, ADRB2, ADRB3), both of which play significant roles in cardiac function and blood pressure regulation. Binding to thyroid hormone receptors (THRA, THRB) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) like PPARG and PPARA indicates broader systemic effects, including on metabolic processes and possibly liver steatosis. Enzymatically, amiodarone is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2C8, with involvement from other cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C9. It is transported by P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and other solute carriers, with serum albumin (ALB) acting as a carrier protein.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of amiodarone involves genetic variations that may influence both therapeutic effects and risk of adverse reactions. Specifically, KCNH2 polymorphisms have been implicated in altering susceptibility to long QT syndrome or cardiac arrhythmia in the context of amiodarone treatment, although detailed SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) data is not directly provided. Additionally, the metabolism and efficacy of the drug could potentially be affected by variants in the genes encoding enzymes responsible for its metabolism (e.g., CYP3A4, CYP2C8), which could affect drug levels and toxicity. However, specific actionable genotypes such as those involving in increased risk for toxicity or therapy failure would require more precise genetic testing and clinical validation. The genetic influence on absorption, distribution, and other pharmacodynamic aspects could also play roles in personalized therapy adjustments and risk management for amiodarone.
