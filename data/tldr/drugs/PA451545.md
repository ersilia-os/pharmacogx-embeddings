## Drug Summary
Sulfanilamide, also known as Streptocid, falls under the class of sulfonamide antibiotics. It is primarily used to treat vulvovaginitis caused by *Candida albicans*. Sulfanilamide operates as a competitive inhibitor of bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase, essential in the synthesis of folic acid needed for bacterial replication. The drug is well known for its bacteriostatic properties, effective against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. It inhibits bacterial multiplication by acting as a competitive inhibitor of *p*-aminobenzoic acid in the folic acid metabolism cycle. The drug is absorbed through the vaginal mucosa, but systemic absorption levels following intravaginal dosing remain unclear due to a lack of pharmacokinetic data. Sulfonamides, such as Sulfanilamide, are known for their ability to distribute widely throughout body tissues.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary molecular target of Sulfanilamide is the bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthase, specifically in strains such as *Escherichia coli* (strain K12). The inhibition of this enzyme prevents the synthesis of folic acid, a critical component for bacterial growth and replication. Sulfonamides like Sulfanilamide mimic the structure of the substrate *p*-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), thus competitively inhibiting the enzyme's action. There are no specific human enzymes, transporters, or carriers implicated in the drug's action or disposition as indicated in the database, focusing its activity on targeting bacterial processes.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is no specific pharmacogenetic information provided in the DrugBank entry for Sulfanilamide. Typically, pharmacogenetics investigates variations in drug response due to genetic differences among individuals. However, for antibiotics like Sulfanilamide, the focus is often more on bacterial genetics, specifically resistance mechanisms, rather than human genetic variability. Resistance to one sulfonamide generally confers resistance to others due to acquired changes in bacterial genes affecting drug targets or metabolic pathways. Human pharmacogenetic influences on the drug's action or side effects have not been well-documented, which may be an area for future research, particularly given the side effects and toxicity concerns related to its long-term use.
