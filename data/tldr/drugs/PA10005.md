## Drug Summary
Adefovir dipivoxil, known by various trade names such as Preveon, Hepsera, and others, is an oral antiviral medication specifically indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. It belongs to the class of acyclic nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (ntRTIs). The drug works by impeding viral replication and is approved for use in adult patients with active viral replication and liver function issues, including those resistant to lamivudine. Adefovir dipivoxil is a prodrug, which means it is metabolized into its active form, adefovir, once ingested. Notably, adefovir shows a bioavailability of approximately 59%, with peak plasma concentrations occurring between 0.58 and 4 hours post-administration. It is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, with about 45% of the dose recovered as adefovir in urine over 24 hours.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The active metabolite of adefovir dipivoxil, adefovir diphosphate, selectively inhibits the hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA polymerase/reverse transcriptase. It blocks the viral replication process by competing with the natural substrate and inducing chain termination after incorporation into viral DNA. The drugâ€™s metabolism involves cellular kinases but not cytochrome P450 enzymes, enhancing its safety profile in terms of drug-drug interactions. Renal elimination is facilitated by transporters such as SLC22A6 and ABCC4, which are involved in the renal excretion of adefovir. Other transporters like ABCC5 and SLC22A3 also play roles in its handling within the body. Key enzymes involved include adenylate kinase 2 and 4 (AK2 and AK4) and nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NME1 and NME2), crucial for the phosphorylation processes enabling its antiviral efficacy.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, specific pharmacogenetic data on adefovir dipivoxil, particularly focusing on genetic polymorphisms that may affect its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, is limited or not elaborately studied in literature or databases such as PharmGKB and DrugBank. However, given its metabolism by enzymes like adenylate kinases and nucleoside diphosphate kinases and transport by SLC22A6 and ABCC4, genetic variations in these proteins might influence its effectiveness and safety, particularly renal toxicity and drug clearance. It is plausible to infer that polymorphisms in genes encoding these kinases and transporters could alter drug levels and the response in patients, although this requires further clinical validation. Renal safety, in particular, might be an area where pharmacogenetics can eventually play a significant role due to observed nephrotoxicity associated with its use, as noted in both clinical and preclinical settings.
