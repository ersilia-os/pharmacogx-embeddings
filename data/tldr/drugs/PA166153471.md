## Drug Summary
Abemaciclib, marketed under the name Verzenio, is an antitumor agent classified as a dual inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 (CDK4) and 6 (CDK6). These kinases play vital roles in the cell cycle, particularly in the transition from the G1 to the S phase by phosphorylating and inactivating the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, thereby promoting cell proliferation. Abemaciclib was approved by the FDA on September 28, 2017, for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer following endocrine therapy failure. It is used either as monotherapy or in combination with fulvestrant. Abemaciclib demonstrates favorable pharmacokinetics, with dose-proportional increases in plasma concentration and a bioavailability of 45%. The drug primarily undergoes hepatic metabolism mediated by CYP3A4, producing several active metabolites that contribute to its antitumor efficacy.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Abemaciclib specifically targets CDK4 and CDK6, inhibiting their activity to arrest the cell cycle in the G1 phase. This effect is pivotal in controlling hyperproliferative cancer cells that rely on these kinases to bypass tumor suppressant checkpoints. Key enzymes involved in the metabolism of abemaciclib include CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. Transporters such as SLC47A1, SLC47A2 (multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins), SLC22A2 (a solute carrier family member), ABCG2, and ABCB1 (ATP-binding cassette transporters) are involved in its pharmacokinetics and may affect its distribution and elimination. Carriers identified include serum albumin (ALB) and alpha1-acid glycoprotein (ORM2), which can influence the drug's plasma protein binding and overall disposition.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of abemaciclib predominantly involves its metabolism by CYP3A4, making variations in the CYP3A4 gene potentially significant for individual responses to the drug. Patients with genetic polymorphisms that impact CYP3A4 activity could experience altered drug levels, affecting both efficacy and toxicity. Additionally, transporters like ABCG2 and ABCB1, known to be influenced by genetic polymorphisms, could modify the drug's distribution and excretion patterns, further personalizing medication outcomes. While specific pharmacogenetic data from clinical trials or genomic studies were not detailed, these associations underscore the importance of genetic factors in tailoring abemaciclib therapy for optimal therapeutic effects with minimal adverse reactions.
