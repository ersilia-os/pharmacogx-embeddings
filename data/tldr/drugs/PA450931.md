## Drug Summary
Phenylalanine is an essential aromatic amino acid with a wide range of physiological roles and medical uses. As a precursor for several neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and thyroid hormones like thyroxine, it plays a crucial role in various bodily functions. Phenylalanine may be beneficial in managing conditions like depression and vitiligo, although it might worsen symptoms in patients with disorders such as tardive dyskinesia and phenylketonuria (PKU). The absorption of phenylalanine occurs in the small intestine via a sodium-dependent active transport, and it is primarily metabolized in the liver, with unused excess being distributed to other tissues.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Phenylalanine interacts with several biological targets critical for its metabolic pathway. Key targets include Phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase (PAH), responsible for converting phenylalanine to tyrosine; Tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT), which breaks down tyrosine; and Tyrosine 3-monooxygenase (TH), crucial for synthesizing neurotransmitters from tyrosine. In addition, enzymes such as the Phenylalanine--tRNA ligase alpha subunit (FARSA), mitochondrial ligase (FARS2), and beta subunit (FARSB) are involved in the protein synthesis process. Transport of phenylalanine across cells is facilitated by carriers like SLC7A8 and the monocarboxylate transporter 10 (SLC16A10). 

## Pharmacogenetics
One of the most significant pharmacogenetic considerations for phenylalanine is its association with phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU is a metabolic disorder resulting from a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), which leads to toxic levels of phenylalanine in the body if left untreated. Genetic mutations in the PAH gene dictate the severity and responsiveness of PKU to dietary management. The impact of phenylalanine on conditions like tardive dyskinesia is less clearly understood but is believed to be influenced by genetic variations affecting neurotransmitter systems. Despite the absence of specific pharmacogenetic data in the provided material, the gene-disease association between PAH mutations and PKU is a well-established example of how genetic factors can influence drug efficacy and safety.
