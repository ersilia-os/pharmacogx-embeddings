## Drug Summary
Sitagliptin, marketed under the name Januvia among others, is an oral dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor extensively prescribed to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Key benefits of sitagliptin involve its use in combination with diet and exercise, and it can also be used adjunctively with other medications like metformin or ertugliflozin. Sitagliptin shows a high oral bioavailability of 87%, and food does not alter its pharmacokinetics. This medication principally operates by enhancing levels of incretins, which modulate glucose metabolism through insulin secretion and glucagon reduction, responsive to glucose concentrations. It is minimally metabolized, primarily excreted unchanged in urine, with minor pathways involving cytochrome p450 enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C8.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Sitagliptin specifically inhibits the enzyme DPP-4, which is instrumental in controlling levels of incretins such as GLP-1 and GIP that play crucial roles in glucose homeostasis through their influence on insulin and glucagon secretion. As for its metabolism, Sitagliptin involves minor pathways mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes, mainly CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP2C8, which are relevant but not primarily responsible for its elimination. The transporters identified include ABCB1, also known as P-glycoprotein 1, which may interact with sitagliptin to affect its pharmacokinetics, and SLC22A8 or solute carrier family 22 member 8, which might play a role in its renal secretion.

## Pharmacogenetics
Though specific pharmacogenomic data are not provided, inferred interactions can be significant in the context of Sitagliptin's use. Variations in the CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 genes could potentially affect the metabolism of sitagliptin, albeit these pathways are minor. Polymorphisms in these genes might modulate the drug's plasma concentration and efficacy. Furthermore, variations in transporter genes like ABCB1 and SLC22A8 could influence the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Considering the minimal metabolism and significant excretion of sitagliptin unchanged in the urine, genetic variations in renal transporters could play a significant role in drug disposition and response, potentially necessitating dosage adjustments in patients with genetic variations affecting these proteins. However, clinical studies directly linking these pharmacogenomic factors with outcomes in sitagliptin therapy are limited, indicating an area for future research.
