## Drug Summary
Nitrendipine is marketed under various brand names such as Bayotensin, Baypress, and several others. It belongs to the class of drugs known as calcium channel blockers, specifically targeting the L-type calcium channels. These agents are primarily used for their vasodilatory properties in the management of hypertension. Nitrendipine is distinct from other calcium channel blockers as it does not adversely affect the glomerular filtration rate and possesses a mild natriuretic effect rather than causing sodium retention. This drug is generally prescribed for the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension and can be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, such as ACE inhibitors. It works through multiple mechanisms, including deforming the calcium channels, inhibiting ion-control gating mechanisms, and interfering with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. These actions result in the dilation of coronary and systemic arteries, reduced peripheral resistance, decreased blood pressure, and reduced cardiac workload.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Nitrendipine acts on several subunits of the voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels ('CACNA1C', 'CACNA2D1', 'CACNB2', 'CACNA1D', 'CACNA1S', 'CACNA2D2', 'CACNA1H', 'CACNA1F', 'CACNB1', 'CACNB3', 'CACNB4', and several others). These channels are crucial in controlling the influx of calcium which affects muscle contraction and vascular tone. Additionally, Nitrendipine influences various calcium-activated potassium channels ('KCNMA1', 'KCNMB1', 'KCNMB2', 'KCNMB3', 'KCNMB4', 'KCNN1', 'KCNN2', 'KCNN3', 'KCNN4'), which adds to its ability to modulate vascular tone. The drug is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7. It is also transported by ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1) and ABCB11 (Bile salt export pump), which affects its bioavailability and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of Nitrendipine involves significant interactions with genes coding for metabolizing enzymes and transport proteins. Variants in the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 genes can alter the metabolic rate of Nitrendipine, affecting both its efficacy and toxicity. For instance, individuals carrying the CYP3A5*3 allele typically exhibit reduced enzyme activity, potentially leading to higher plasma levels of Nitrendipine, which can increase the risk of adverse effects. Similarly, variations in the ABCB1 gene that encodes P-glycoprotein could influence the drug's distribution and elimination, impacting therapeutic outcomes. Although specific pharmacogenetic guidelines for Nitrendipine dosing based on genetic variants are not well established, understanding these interactions can help tailor treatments for better safety and efficacy.
