## Drug Summary
Maraviroc, sold under the brand names Selzentry in the U.S. and Celsentri outside of it, is an antiretroviral medication used primarily for the treatment of CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infection. It is administered in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Developed by Pfizer, maraviroc was approved by the FDA in 2007. As an entry inhibitor, its mechanism is unique in that it blocks HIV from entering human cells. It achieves this by antagonizing CCR5, a chemokine receptor on the CD4 cells, which HIV traditionally uses to enter these cells. The drug is characterized by a relatively low oral bioavailability, with food intake affecting its pharmacokinetics, such as its maximum concentration and total exposure.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Maraviroc specifically targets the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) on CD4+ T-cells, acting as a selective and reversible antagonist that prevents the interaction between human CCR5 and HIV-1 gp120, thereby inhibiting the entry of the virus into the host cells. Maraviroc is metabolized predominantly by the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme, elucidating the primary pathway for its degradation and clearance from the body. There are no significant transporters or carriers listed for the drug, reinforcing the importance of CYP3A4 in its pharmacokinetic profile.

## Pharmacogenetics
The response to maraviroc can vary based on genetic differences in the CCR5 gene among individuals. Mutations or deletions in the CCR5 gene, such as CCR5-Î”32, can affect the efficacy of maraviroc, as these genetic variations can alter the expression or function of CCR5 receptors on T cells. Additionally, genetic polymorphisms in the CYP3A4 enzyme could potentially influence the metabolism of maraviroc, thereby impacting drug levels and effectiveness. However, no specific guidelines or recommendations based on genomic data for maraviroc have been conclusively established yet. Further research into these pharmacogenetic interactions could improve personalized treatment strategies for HIV using maraviroc.
