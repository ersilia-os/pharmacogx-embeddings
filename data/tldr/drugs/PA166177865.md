## Drug Summary
Alpha-hydroxymetoprolol is not a drug but a primary metabolite of metoprolol, a commonly prescribed beta-blocker used primarily in the treatment of hypertension, angina, and certain heart arrhythmias, as well as for reducing the risk of further heart complications after myocardial infarction. Metoprolol is classified within the beta-1-selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocker class of medications. As a metabolite, alpha-hydroxymetoprolol contributes to the pharmacodynamic activity of the parent drug. Metoprolol undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism predominantly via CYP2D6, forming metabolites such as alpha-hydroxymetoprolol, which still retains some activity relevant to the effects seen with the parent compound.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Since alpha-hydroxymetoprolol is a metabolite rather than an active drug itself, the primary targets relate to the action of its parent compound, metoprolol. Metoprolol primarily targets the beta-1 adrenergic receptors located chiefly in cardiac tissue, initiating a reduction in heart rate, myocardial contractility, and cardiac output, all of which contribute to its therapeutic effect in hypertension and angina. In terms of metabolism, metoprolol’s biotransformation predominantly involves CYP2D6, and the metabolites, including alpha-hydroxymetoprolol, are less clinically significant compared to the parent compound.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetics plays a crucial role in the metabolism of metoprolol, and this interplays significantly with its effectiveness and patient response variability. Metoprolol is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6, and genetic variations in this enzyme are known to markedly influence drug clearance, serum levels, and clinical effects. Individuals with reduced or non-functional CYP2D6 alleles (“poor metabolizers”) might exhibit higher concentrations of metoprolol with increased therapeutic and adverse effects, whereas those with multiple copies of active alleles (“ultra-rapid metabolizers”) may metabolize the drug too quickly, reducing its effectiveness. Such genetic variations can indirectly affect the levels and action of alpha-hydroxymetoprolol, although direct studies on this metabolite’s pharmacogenetics are limited. It can be inferred that alterations in CYP2D6 activity could alter the production and possibly the minor activity of alpha-hydroxymetoprolol.
