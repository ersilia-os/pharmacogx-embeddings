## Drug Summary
Amiloride is a potassium-sparing diuretic, classified as both an antikaliuretic and antihypertensive agent. Its chemical structure is unique among diuretics, as it belongs to the pyrazine-carbonyl-guanidine class. Approved in 1967, amiloride functions primarily to mitigate the risk of potassium loss, which can often occur with the use of other diuretics. It achieves this by blocking sodium channels in the kidney, particularly within the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts, facilitating the excretion of sodium and water without significant potassium elimination. Pharmacokinetically, amiloride is readily absorbed after oral administration, is not metabolized by the liver, and is excreted unchanged in the urine. While it offers benefits in reducing blood pressure and managing fluid retention in congestive heart failure, its use also poses a risk of hyperkalemia, especially when combined with ACE inhibitors or spironolactone.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Amiloride directly targets multiple subunits of the amiloride-sensitive sodium channels including SCNN1A (alpha subunit), SCNN1B (beta subunit), SCNN1G (gamma subunit), and SCNN1D (delta subunit). These channels are crucial for sodium reabsorption in the kidney. In addition, amiloride interacts with acid-sensing ion channels (ASIC1 and ASIC2) responsible for sensing extracellular protons, which play roles in pain sensation and other neurological processes. Amiloride-sensitive amine oxidase (AOC1), which acts as both a target and an enzyme involved in metabolic processes, is also affected by this drug. Transportwise, amiloride is managed by the solute carrier family members SLC22A2 and SLC22A4, which handle organic cation transporters in renal and other tissues. No specific carrier proteins were identified for amiloride.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetically, variations in genes encoding the epithelial sodium channels (SCNN1A, SCNN1B, SCNN1G, SCNN1D) have significant potential to influence the response to amiloride, impacting its efficacy and risk of adverse effects such as hyperkalemia. Further genetic variations in these channels could predict a patient's sensitivity to the potassium-sparing effects of the drug, making genotyping a useful tool in personalized medicine for hypertension or heart failure management. Additionally, the enzymes AOC1 could vary between individuals, which can alter drug dynamics, toxicity, or interactions. However, extensive pharmacogenetic data specific to Amiloride is currently limited, highlighting an area for future research to better tailor therapy on a genetic basis.
