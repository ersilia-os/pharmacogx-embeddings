## Drug Summary
Clomipramine, also known by its trade names Anapramine and Hydiphen, is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) mainly used to treat disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and depression. Clomipramine works primarily by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, enhancing their effects in the central nervous system. It modifies receptor sensitivity within the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Pharmacodynamically, it possesses anticholinergic, sedative, and adrenergic-blocking properties, contributing to its overall side effects such as sedation, hypotension, and anticholinergic effects. The drug is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with a bioavailability of approximately 50%, due to significant first-pass metabolism. It reaches peak plasma concentrations within 2 to 6 hours after administration.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Clomipramine's primary targets include the sodium-dependent serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) and various serotonin receptors such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C. This drug also inhibits the sodium-dependent noradrenaline transporter (SLC6A2). It is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily via cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4 into its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine and other lesser-known metabolites. The absorption and systemic effects of clomipramine are influenced by the transporter protein P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1) and it binds to serum albumin (ALB) which may affect its distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
Genetic variations significantly influence the metabolism and efficacy of clomipramine. Polymorphisms in CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 are notably crucial. Specific alleles like rs3892097, rs35742686, rs5030655, rs1135824, and rs28371733 in the CYP2D6 gene, and rs4244285 and rs4986893 in the CYP2C19 gene, are associated with reduced or poor metabolism of clomipramine. Individuals with these genotypes may experience different therapeutic outcomes and adverse effects, necessitating dose adjustments or alternative treatments. The genetic profile of a patient can be critical in determining the most effective and safe dosing regimen, thereby personalizing the treatment approach for better mental health outcomes.
