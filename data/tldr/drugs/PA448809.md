## Drug Summary
Carisoprodol, sold under various brand names including Carisoma, Gencari, and Listaflex, was first approved by the FDA in 1959. It is a centrally acting muscle relaxant prescribed for the relief of discomfort associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. The therapy is recommended alongside physical therapy and other treatments and is strictly used for short durations (up to two or three weeks) due to inadequate evidence of long-term efficacy and significant potential for dependency and abuse. Carisoprodol acts on the central nervous system rather than directly on skeletal muscles. It alters interneuronal activity in the spinal cord and brain, contributing to its muscle relaxant properties. The primary metabolite, meprobamate, has anxiolytic and sedative effects. The drug is metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and its bioavailability and pharmacokinetics are not significantly affected by food.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Carisoprodol modulates several subunits of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor in the brain, specifically targeting GABRA1, GABRB2, GABRG2, GABRA5, and GABRA3. These receptors are crucial for mediating the inhibitory effects of GABA, contributing to the drug's anxiolytic and muscle relaxant effects. The main enzyme involved in carisoprodol metabolism is CYP2C19, which converts it into the active metabolite meprobamate. There are no specific transporters or carriers identified in the metabolism or action of carisoprodol.

## Pharmacogenetics
Carisoprodol metabolism is significantly influenced by genetic polymorphisms in the CYP2C19 enzyme. Variations in this gene can lead to differences in the metabolic rate of carisoprodol, affecting both its efficacy and risk of adverse effects. Poor metabolizers (individuals with reduced CYP2C19 activity) might experience heightened or prolonged effects of carisoprodol due to slower conversion to meprobamate, while rapid metabolizers might have reduced effectiveness. This pharmacogenetic variation is critical for determining the appropriate dosing and assessing the risk of dependence or side effects in different individuals. Genetic testing could be beneficial in managing therapy with carisoprodol, particularly in populations with known variation in CYP2C19 activity.
