## Drug Summary
Nifedipine is a first-generation calcium channel blocker, particularly blocking the L-type calcium channels, and is commonly used in the management of angina and hypertension. Marketed under various names such as Adapine, Afeditab, and Nifedical, among others, nifedipine was first developed by Bayer and approved by the FDA in 1981. It acts by inhibiting the influx of calcium ions during depolarization in vascular smooth muscle and myocardial cells, leading to vasodilation, reduced peripheral resistance, and increased oxygen supply to the heart. Nifedipine is administered either sublingually or orally, with its bioavailability affected by extensive first-pass metabolism, typically resulting in a bioavailability of 45-68%. The drug's dosing can vary from 10 mg to 120 mg daily, adjusting based on the formulation and clinical response required.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Nifedipine targets multiple subunits of the voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels, such as CACNA1C, CACNA1D, and CACNA1S, critical for its vasodilatory action on cardiac and smooth muscle tissues. The drug also interacts with various cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent other cytochromes like CYP2D6 and CYP1A2, which affect its plasma concentrations. Nifedipine is also associated with several transporters and carriers, including P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), which can modulate its absorption and distribution in the body, and its interaction with serum albumin (ALB) influences its bioavailability and pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of nifedipine is particularly influenced by the genetic variability in the CYP3A4 gene, which is primarily responsible for its metabolism. Polymorphisms in the CYP3A4 gene can lead to variations in the metabolic rate of nifedipine, affecting drug levels and, consequently, its efficacy and toxicity. Individuals with different CYP3A4 variants may require dose adjustments to achieve optimal therapeutic effects. Additionally, variants in ABCB1, which codes for P-glycoprotein, can alter nifedipine's absorption and distribution, potentially modifying its clinical effects. Given these factors, genetic testing may be considered in some clinical settings to tailor nifedipine therapy more precisely to individual genetic profiles, thus optimizing therapeutic outcomes and minimizing adverse effects.
