## Drug Summary
Glyburide, also known as glibenclamide and marketed under names such as Daonil, Delmide, Novo-Glyburide, and Semi-Daonil, is a second-generation sulfonylurea. This oral hypoglycemic agent is prescribed primarily for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus, especially in patients who do not respond adequately to first-line therapy with metformin. Glyburide functions by promoting insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cells. It achieves this by inhibiting ATP-sensitive potassium channels, primarily the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1), leading to cellular depolarization, calcium influx, and ultimately insulin release. This drug was first approved by the FDA in 1984 and is known for its once-daily dosing due to its long duration of action. Its pharmacokinetics reveal a rapid absorption with peak plasma concentrations achieved within about 1 to 3 hours post-administration, and substantial metabolism primarily involving CYP3A4 and CYP2C9.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Glyburide specifically targets ATP-sensitive potassium channels on the pancreatic beta cells, which include the SUR1 and Kir6.2 subunits encoded by the ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes, respectively. Additionally, it influences other potassium channels (KCNJ8, KCNJ11) and various transport channels, including the bile salt export pump (ABCB11) and the ATP-binding cassette transporters like ABCC9 and ABCA1. The drug is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4, with contributions from CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A7, and CYP3A5. Transporter proteins identified as being involved with glyburide include various organic anion transporters like ABCC3, ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), and several solute carrier family proteins (SLCO1A2, SLC22A6, SLC22A7). It is also carried by serum albumin (ALB), which may impact its distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of glyburide involves variants in the genes encoding its metabolic enzymes and targets. Variants in CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 can significantly influence glyburide metabolism and, consequently, its pharmacokinetics and dynamics. Patients with certain allelic variations in these genes may experience altered drug levels, affecting efficacy and risk of adverse effects such as hypoglycemia. Additionally, genetic differences in the sulfonylurea receptor (ABCC8, KCNJ11) could alter the drug's effectiveness in stimulating insulin release, potentially necessitating dose adjustments. Although comprehensive pharmacogenomic data for glyburide might not be extensively detailed, the influence of these genetic factors underscores the importance of personalized medicine approaches in managing diabetes treatment with glyburide. These insights are supported by both clinical observations and pharmacogenetic studies indicating variability in patient responses based on genetic makeup.
