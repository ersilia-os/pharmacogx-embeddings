## Drug Summary
Lesinurad is a uric acid transporter inhibitor primarily used to manage hyperuricemia associated with gout. It operates by selectively inhibiting uric acid transporters in the renal tubules to facilitate excretion and reduce serum uric acid levels. Marketed under the brand names Zurampic and Duzallo (in combination with allopurinol), Lesinurad is indicated for use alongside a xanthine oxidase inhibitor in gout patients who have not reached target serum uric acid levels with xanthine oxidase inhibitor alone. The drug shows a rapid oral absorption, reaching peak plasma concentrations 1-4 hours after ingestion, and it primarily undergoes oxidative metabolism mediated by polymorphic enzymes, notably CYP2C9.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Lesinurad acts by inhibiting the function of uric acid transporter 1 (URAT1, encoded by the gene SLC22A12) and organic anion transporter 4 (OAT4, encoded by the gene SLC22A11), both crucial in the reuptake of uric acid from the renal tubules. This inhibition results in increased excretion of uric acid. The pharmacokinetics of Lesinurad are influenced by its metabolism which primarily involves cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly CYP2C9 and also CYP3A4, contributing to its metabolic clearance.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic aspects of Lesinurad involve its metabolism, predominantly through the CYP2C9 enzyme, which is known to be highly polymorphic. Variants in CYP2C9 can affect drug metabolism rates leading to variable therapeutic outcomes and risk of adverse effects. For instance, individuals with reduced function CYP2C9 alleles (*2 and *3 variants) might experience higher plasma levels of Lesinurad, leading to an increased risk of side effects. These pharmacogenetic considerations can guide dose adjustments and therapy decisions to optimize efficacy and safety in treating gout-associated hyperuricemia with Lesinurad. However, detailed genomic data or other specific pharmacogenetic interactions for Lesinurad have not been mentioned, indicating a potential area for further clinical research and validation.
