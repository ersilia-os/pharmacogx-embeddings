## Drug Summary
Sorafenib, known by its DrugBank number DB00398, is an oral multikinase inhibitor primarily used in oncology as an antitumor agent. The drug is a bi-aryl urea that interferes with both cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors and intracellular kinases, key mediators of tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis. It was first approved in 2007 for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, and its indications have expanded to include advanced renal cell carcinoma and differentiated thyroid carcinoma that is refractory to radioactive iodine treatment. Sorafenib's pharmacodynamics involve reducing tumor angiogenesis, inducing tumor cell apoptosis, and inhibiting viral replication of hepatitis C in vitro. Sorafenib reaches steady-state concentration within seven days with an average Tmax of about three hours. The drug undergoes metabolism primarily through CYP3A4-mediated oxidation and glucuronidation via UGT1A9.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Sorafenib acts on multiple targets, including kinases like BRAF, RAF1, and various members of the VEGF receptor family (FLT1, FLT4, KDR), which play roles in the RAF/MEK/ERK and VEGFR signaling pathways critical for cell proliferation and angiogenesis. It also targets PDGFRB, FLT3, KIT, FGFR1, and RET. The metabolism of sorafenib involves several cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, and others. Furthermore, the drug's distribution and excretion are influenced by transporters like ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) and ABCG2. Sorafenib also interacts with phase II metabolic enzyme UGT1A9, important for its glucuronidation.

## Pharmacogenetics
Sorafenib’s pharmacogenetics aspects are critical given its metabolism via CYP enzymes and modification by UGT1A9. Variants in genes encoding these enzymes can influence the drug’s pharmacokinetics and potentially its efficacy and toxicity. For instance, polymorphisms in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 could affect the rate of sorafenib metabolism, altering exposure to the drug. Moreover, polymorphisms in ABC transporters like ABCB1 and ABCG2 could modify drug distribution and excretion, influencing the systemic and tissue-specific concentrations of sorafenib, which may correlate with both therapeutic outcomes and adverse effects. Although direct associations in treatment responses based on genetic variations require more clinical data, these pharmacokinetic considerations are integral for personalized medicine approaches with sorafenib treatment.
