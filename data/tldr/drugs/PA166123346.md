## Drug Summary
Bilirubin is not a drug but a yellowish pigment found normally in bile, a fluid produced by the liver. It is a product of the breakdown of red blood cells specifically from the heme component of hemoglobin. Elevated levels of bilirubin can lead to jaundice, which is characterized by a yellowing of the skin and eyes. The liver processes bilirubin which is then excreted through bile and urine. Bilirubin exists primarily in two forms in the human body: unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin which circulates in the plasma bound to albumin, and conjugated (direct) bilirubin which is water-soluble and excreted into the bile. The measurement of bilirubin levels is crucial in the diagnosis of various liver and blood disorders.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
As bilirubin is a metabolic byproduct rather than a pharmaceutical agent, it is not designed to target specific biological molecules. However, several proteins are crucial in its metabolism. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) is vital for the conjugation of bilirubin, making it soluble and excretable. The process involves converting unconjugated bilirubin into conjugated bilirubin in the liver. Transporters such as MRP2 and other members of the ABC transporter family actively transport conjugated bilirubin into the bile, aiding its excretion. Any dysfunction in these enzymes or transporters can lead to altered bilirubin metabolism, affecting its serum levels.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics associated with bilirubin largely involves variations in the gene UGT1A1. Polymorphisms in UGT1A1, such as UGT1A1*28 characterized by a TA repeat polymorphism in the promoter region, are known to reduce the enzyme's activity. This leads to decreased conjugation and increased levels of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood, a condition known as Gilbertâ€™s syndrome, which is characterized by mild, chronic unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Individuals with certain UGT1A1 variations can be predisposed to drug-induced toxicity when treated with drugs like irinotecan, a chemotherapy agent, as UGT1A1 is also responsible for its metabolism. Testing for UGT1A1 polymorphisms can be crucial in therapeutic decision making for such drugs to adjust dosages and avoid adverse effects.
