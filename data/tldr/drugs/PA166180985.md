## Drug Summary
Ara-CTP, or cytarabine triphosphate, is the active metabolite of cytarabine, a chemotherapy agent used primarily in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other hematological malignancies. Cytarabine, classified under antimetabolites, is a cytosine analog that interferes with DNA synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme DNA polymerase. It is a prodrug that undergoes intracellular activation to form ara-CTP, which gets incorporated into DNA, leading to chain termination during DNA synthesis. Cytarabine is administered intravenously and its pharmacokinetics involves rapid metabolism in the liver and kidneys, with a short plasma half-life.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Ara-CTP targets DNA polymerase as its primary molecular mechanism of action, inhibiting DNA synthesis, which is crucial for the proliferation of rapidly dividing cancer cells. Cytarabine is transported across cell membranes and is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) to form cytarabine monophosphate, which is further phosphorylated to the active triphosphate form, ara-CTP. The metabolism and activation of cytarabine to ara-CTP involve several kinases, while its inactivation involves deamination by cytidine deaminase (CDA).

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetics plays a significant role in the effectiveness and toxicity profile of cytarabine and thereby ara-CTP. Variations in the DCK gene, which is responsible for the phosphorylation of cytarabine, can influence treatment outcomes, as alterations in enzyme activity affect the formation of ara-CTP. Furthermore, polymorphisms in CDA, which inactivates cytarabine, impact drug clearance and toxicity. Patients with certain CDA polymorphisms may experience increased drug toxicity due to slower cytarabine metabolism. Additionally, genetic variants related to other enzymes involved in the nucleotide salvage pathway may also modify responses to cytarabine therapy, impacting ara-CTP levels and treatment efficacy.
