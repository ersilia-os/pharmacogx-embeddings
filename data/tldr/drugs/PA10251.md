## Drug Summary
Atazanavir, also known by its other names Latazanavir and Zrivada, is an antiretroviral medication used primarily for the treatment of HIV-1 infections. As a protease inhibitor (PI), it functions by interfering with the protease enzyme in HIV, which is crucial for the maturation of the virus, thereby preventing it from forming infectious particles. Approved by the FDA in 2003, atazanavir is unique among PIs for its once-daily dosing and relatively mild impact on lipid profiles compared to other PIs. Pharmacokinetically, it exhibits nonlinear properties with its absorption enhanced when taken with food. The drug reaches a steady state concentration in about 4-8 days and demonstrates significant pharmacokinetic variability when not taken with meals.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary target of atazanavir is the HIV-1 protease, where it binds to prevent the cleavage of viral polyproteins, crucial in viral replication. Regarding the metabolism, atazanavir is extensively processed mainly by cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly by CYP3A4, along with contributions from other CYP450 enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP1A2, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7. It is also a substrate for several transporters including P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), Multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (ABCC1), and various solute carrier family members like SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, and SLCO2B1. Proteins such as serum albumin (ALB) and alpha1-acid glycoprotein (ORM2) act as carriers, affecting its distribution within the body.

## Pharmacogenetics
Atazanavir's pharmacogenetics primarily involves its interaction with the UGT1A1 gene. Variants in UGT1A1 like rs3064744, rs8175347, and rs887829 have been associated with an increased risk of hyperbilirubinemia in patients treated with atazanavir. This effect is derived from the UGT1A1 enzyme's role in bilirubin glucuronidation, an essential pathway for the elimination of bilirubin, a byproduct of red blood cell breakdown. Variations in this gene can lead to reduced enzyme activity, resulting in elevated serum bilirubin levels, manifesting as jaundice, a common adverse reaction in patients receiving atazanavir. This genetic information can help in tailoring antiretroviral therapy to minimize adverse effects while maximizing therapeutic efficacy.
