## Drug Summary
Hydrocortisone, known by various brand names such as Acticort, Cortaid, and others, is a glucocorticoid used mainly for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. It mimics cortisol, a steroid hormone produced naturally by the adrenal cortex. Hydrocortisone was first discovered in the 1930s by Edward Kendall and received FDA approval in 1952. It is employed in various formulations including oral, topical, and enema forms for conditions ranging from endocrine disorders and allergies to inflammatory skin diseases and gastrointestinal issues. The pharmacokinetics of hydrocortisone varies significantly among individuals. Generally, oral hydrocortisone exhibits moderate absorption with variability in peak plasma concentrations, whereas topical forms show a range of bioavailability from 4-19%.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Hydrocortisone primarily acts through binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), influencing multiple cellular mechanisms like reduction of leukocyte migration to inflammation sites and inhibition of inflammatory genes. Additional targets include Annexin A1 (ANXA1), involved in anti-inflammatory responses. Hydrocortisone is metabolized predominantly by the cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and others, with metabolites including 6-beta hydrocortisol and tetrahydrocortisone. In terms of transport, key players include P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1) and various solute carrier family members like SLCO1A2 and SLC22A8. It is also carried by proteins such as sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and corticosteroid-binding globulin (SERPINA6).

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of hydrocortisone revolves significantly around its metabolism by CYP3A enzymes. Variations in genes encoding these enzymes, such as polymorphisms in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, contribute to the large inter-individual variability in the metabolism and overall pharmacokinetics of hydrocortisone. Patients with different allelic variants of these genes might require dose adjustments due to faster or slower drug metabolism. Furthermore, transporters like ABCB1, influenced by genetic variations, can also affect the disposition and systemic effects of hydrocortisone. While explicit genomic data specific to hydrocortisone wasn't provided, these gene-drug interactions are inferred from general pharmacogenomic knowledge and may require personalized consideration in clinical settings.
