## Drug Summary
Maprotiline, known by brand names such as Deprilept and Psymion, is a tetracyclic antidepressant that exhibits pharmacological properties similar to those of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Maprotiline primarily inhibits the neuronal uptake of norepinephrine and also exhibits antihistaminic and anticholinergic activities, though it does not significantly inhibit serotonin reuptake or affect monoamine oxidase activity. The drug is utilized for the treatment of various depressive states including major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, and depressive neurosis. Pharmacokinetically, maprotiline is slowly but completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract upon oral administration and is primarily metabolized in the liver through various pathways including N-demethylation and hydroxylation, primarily yielding the active metabolite desmethylmaprotiline.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Maprotiline acts on multiple targets. It inhibits the sodium-dependent noradrenaline transporter (SLC6A2), which is critical for its antidepressant effects by increasing noradrenaline levels in the synaptic cleft. Additionally, it antagonizes various receptors including muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM2, CHRM3, CHRM4, CHRM5), alpha-1 adrenergic receptors (ADRA1A, ADRA1B, ADRA1D), and histamine H1 receptors (HRH1), contributing to its side effect profile and therapeutic actions. Furthermore, maprotiline interacts with 5-HT receptors (HTR2A, HTR2C, HTR7) and dopamine receptors (DRD2), albeit weakly. It also acts as an antagonist at alpha-2 adrenergic receptors (ADRA2A, ADRA2B, ADRA2C). Key metabolic enzymes are CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, and it is carried by alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1).

## Pharmacogenetics
Maprotiline metabolism is significantly influenced by the activity of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 enzymes. Variations in the genes encoding these enzymes can affect the drug's plasma levels and therefore its efficacy and safety. For instance, individuals with reduced activity alleles of CYP2D6 may exhibit higher plasma concentrations of maprotiline, potentially leading to increased risk of side effects. Conversely, those with multiple active copies of CYP2D6 might process the drug too quickly, reducing its effectiveness. This pharmacogenetic information is crucial for personalizing the dosages of maprotiline to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects. However, as of the knowledge available up to early 2023, detailed pharmacogenomic data specific to maprotiline's interactions with other genetic variations is limited, underscoring the need for further research in this area.
