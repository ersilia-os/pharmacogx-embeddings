## Drug Summary
Zonisamide, also known by brand names Exceglan and Excegram, is a sulfonamide anticonvulsant primarily used as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults with epilepsy. Approved in Japan in 1989 and later in the US and Europe in 2000 and 2005 respectively, zonisamide helps to prevent the propagation and spread of seizure activities. Its pharmacokinetic profile shows dose-proportional absorption between doses of 200 and 400 mg and a high bioavailability of about 95%. The drug acts mainly by inhibiting voltage-gated sodium and T-type calcium channels, stabilizing neuronal membranes, and potentially altering neurotransmitter levels involving GABA and glutamate. Serious adverse effects include risks of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and possible links to metabolic acidosis due to its inhibition of carbonic anhydrase.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Zonisamide interacts with a variety of targets including multiple subunits of voltage-gated sodium channels (e.g., SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN3A, SCN4A, SCN5A), T-type calcium channels (e.g., CACNA1G, CACNA1H, CACNA1I), and carbonic anhydrases (e.g., CA1, CA2, CA3, CA4, etc.). Furthermore, it binds to GABA(A) receptor sites albeit without changing chloride flux, impacting neuronal excitability and neurotransmission. Metabolism of zonisamide involves primarily reductive and conjugative pathways with CYP3A4 mediating the reduction to its metabolite SMAP, and it shows minimal induction of liver enzymes. Important transport mechanisms include P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), enhancing its transportation across biological membranes.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic aspects of zonisamide are crucial but not extensively detailed in available literature. Given the involvement of CYP3A4 in its metabolism—a gene with known genetic polymorphisms affecting enzyme activity—variability in drug response and toxicity risk could be influenced by CYP3A4 genotypes. Patients with different CYP3A4 alleles may exhibit different metabolizing capabilities, potentially affecting efficacy and safety profiles. Additionally, polymorphisms in genes encoding its targets (e.g., sodium channels and carbonic anhydrases) and transporter genes like ABCB1 could also modulate individual responses to the drug. While specific pharmacogenetic guidelines for zonisamide are not well-established, these considerations highlight the importance of genetic factors in its clinical use.
