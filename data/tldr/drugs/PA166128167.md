## Drug Summary
Daclatasvir, marketed as DAKLINZA, is a direct-acting antiviral agent specifically targeting Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and used in the chronic treatment of HCV genotype 1 and 3 infection. This drug was FDA-approved in July 2015 for use with sofosbuvir, with or without ribavirin. It is administered orally in the form of tablets and acts by inhibiting NS5A, a viral protein crucial for the RNA replication and assembly of the virus. Daclatasvir's pharmacokinetics shows a peak plasma concentration within 2 hours of administration and achieves steady state in about 4 days. The absolute bioavailability of daclatasvir is 67%. Metabolism predominantly occurs via the CYP3A4 enzyme, and daclatasvir exhibits a high plasma stability. It is known for its significant efficacy in achieving sustained virologic response and reducing long-term health complications associated with HCV infections such as hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related mortality.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Daclatasvir targets the nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A), a component of the HCV RNA replication complex, inhibiting both its basally phosphorylated and hyperphosphorylated forms which are critical for viral replication and assembly. Metabolically, daclatasvir is primarily processed by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A43, and CYP3A7. Additionally, it interacts with several transporters including ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, and ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2), which can affect its absorption and disposition. No carriers are specifically mentioned for daclatasvir.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors play a crucial role in daclatasvir’s therapeutic efficacy and resistance profile. Variations in NS5A at positions M28, Q30, L31, and Y93, especially in genotypes 1a and 3, are associated with reduced susceptibility to daclatasvir, generally necessitating resistance testing before treatment initiation in high-risk populations such as those with cirrhosis. Metabolism by CYP3A4 implies that genetic variants in the CYP3A4 gene may influence daclatasvir metabolism, impacting both efficacy and toxicity. Individuals with altered CYP3A4 activity could require dose adjustments or additional monitoring. Furthermore, transporters like SLCO1B1 and ABCB1 are known to be influenced by genetic variants, potentially affecting the drug’s pharmacokinetics and patient response.
