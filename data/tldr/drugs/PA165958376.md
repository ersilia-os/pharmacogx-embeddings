## Drug Summary
Fesoterodine is an antimuscarinic prodrug primarily used for the management of overactive bladder syndrome, including symptoms like urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in adults. It is also employed in treating neurogenic detrusor overactivity in pediatric patients over six years old and weighing more than 25 kg. Fesoterodine is metabolized by plasma esterases into its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), which provides the therapeutic effect by inhibiting bladder contractions through muscarinic receptor antagonism. The drug's bioavailability of its active metabolite, 5-HMT, is reported to be 52%, with a Tmax of 5 hours post-administration. Metabolism of fesoterodine is extensive, primarily involving esterases and further processing by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 into inactive metabolites.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary action of fesoterodine, through its metabolite 5-HMT, is as a competitive antagonist at various muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, specifically CHRM1, CHRM2, CHRM3, CHRM4, and CHRM5, which are involved in bladder contraction modulation. The drug is also subject to metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are involved in the biotransformation of fesoterodine into inactive metabolites. Fesoterodine and its metabolites are transported by ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), which can affect the drug's distribution and excretion. There are no specific carriers associated with the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine detailed in the provided data.

## Pharmacogenetics
Variants in the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 genes significantly influence the metabolism of fesoterodine. CYP2D6 polymorphisms result in varying enzyme activity levels, ranging from poor to ultra-rapid metabolizer status, which can affect the drug's efficacy and safety profile. Individuals with reduced CYP2D6 function might experience increased exposure to fesoterodine, leading potentially to enhanced therapeutic effects or adverse events, while those with higher enzyme activity may require adjustments in dosing. Similarly, CYP3A4, being a major enzyme in the drug metabolism pathway, also has genetic variations that can alter metabolic activity, impacting the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of fesoterodine. Pharmacogenetic testing may guide personalized dosing to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize side effects in clinical settings.
