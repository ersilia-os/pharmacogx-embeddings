## Drug Summary
Fluconazole, known under various trade names including Diflucan, Elazor, and Trican, is an antifungal medication primarily used to treat a variety of fungal infections. As part of the azole antifungal family, its mechanism involves inhibiting the fungal enzyme lanosterol 14-α-demethylase, crucial in ergosterol synthesis, an essential component of the fungal cell membrane. This inhibition leads to an accumulation of intermediate sterols and disrupts cell membrane function, effectively stopping fungal growth. Fluconazole is unique for its high oral bioavailability, which does not significantly alter with food intake, allowing for both oral and intravenous administration. Administered widely since its FDA approval in 1990, this drug offers advantages such as fewer side effects and single-dose efficacy for vaginal yeast infections. Resistance to fluconazole, however, has been noted and continues to be an area requiring vigilance and possible susceptibility testing prior to treatment initiation.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Fluconazole acts primarily through the inhibition of the fungal enzyme lanosterol 14-α-demethylase (gene symbol ERG11). This enzyme is crucial for converting lanosterol to ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell wall. In humans, fluconazole minimally metabolizes but significantly inhibits several cytochromes P450, including CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19, and to a lesser extent, CYP3A5. This can interfere with the metabolism of other drugs and potentially lead to increased plasma levels of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. For transport, Fluconazole is a substrate of the transporter protein ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), which affects its distribution and could influence drug-drug interactions.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetic contexts, fluconazole interaction with various CYP enzymes suggests genetic variations in these genes can influence drug exposure and response. Variants in CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 are known to alter the metabolism of many drugs, potentially leading to either subtherapeutic effects or increased risk of toxicity. For example, individuals with loss-of-function alleles in CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 might experience higher drug levels and thus increased risk of adverse effects when treated with standard doses of fluconazole. Additionally, polymorphisms in ABCB1 could alter the effectiveness and distribution of fluconazole, affecting both efficacy and safety. Hence, genetic tests might inform better dosage customization and risk assessment, although specific guidelines for adjustment based on genetic makeup are not yet fully established for fluconazole.
