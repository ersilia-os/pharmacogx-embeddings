## Drug Summary
Sulfadoxine is an antimalarial drug belonging to the sulfonamide class, frequently used in combination with pyrimethamine under the name Fansidar. Sulfadoxine's main indication is for the treatment and prevention of malaria, particularly against Plasmodium falciparum strains in areas with suspected chloroquine resistance. The combination takes advantage of the synergistic effects between sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine, both of which inhibit different enzymes in the folate synthesis pathway essential for DNA synthesis and cellular replication in the parasite. While the pharmacokinetic properties like absorption and metabolism for sulfadoxine are not detailed in the provided data, this medication is generally known for its long-acting effect which contributes to its use in prophylactic settings.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary target of sulfadoxine is dihydropteroate synthetase of Plasmodium falciparum. This enzyme is crucial for the conversion of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) into dihydropteroate, a key precursor in the synthesis of folic acid within the parasite. By inhibiting this enzyme, sulfadoxine prevents the production of folic acid necessary for the proliferation of the parasite. Another target is the bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase, particularly from the Plasmodium falciparum isolate K1/Thailand, which further ensures the disruption of the folate pathway. There is no information regarding the involvement of specific enzymes, transporters, or carriers in the pharmacokinetics of sulfadoxine which might impact its effectiveness or safety profile.

## Pharmacogenetics
Specific pharmacogenetic data related to sulfadoxine is not provided in the provided description, and as of the current scientific understanding, detailed common genetic variations that significantly alter the drug's pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics selectively in human populations are not well-characterized. However, general knowledge in antimalarial pharmacogenetics suggests variability in drug response might be influenced by genetic differences in immune system function or drug metabolism pathways, albeit primarily related to the partner drug pyrimethamine in the context of Fansidar use. Hence, while sulfadoxine itself might not directly align with known pharmacogenetic markers, the combination therapy with pyrimethamine could be influenced by genetics impacting metabolism enzymes like cytochrome P450s or transport proteins.
