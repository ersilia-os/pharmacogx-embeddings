## Drug Summary
Lenvatinib, also known as Lenvima, is a potent multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor, primarily targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and VEGFR3. It also inhibits other important RTKs involved in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression, such as fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR1-4), PDGFRα, KIT, and RET. Lenvatinib is used in the management of several cancers, including differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and endometrial carcinoma, particularly in cases where the disease is advanced, metastatic, or refractory to conventional treatments. The drug is absorbed orally with peak plasma concentrations reached between 1 to 4 hours post-dose, and its absorption is minimally affected by food. It is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A and aldehyde oxidase.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Lenvatinib acts by inhibiting multiple RTKs: VEGFR1-3 are crucial for angiogenesis; FGFR1-4, RET, KIT, and PDGFRα are involved in cellular proliferation and differentiation pathways. Its wide range of targets explains its efficacy in various cancer types. Metabolically, lenvatinib is primarily broken down by CYP3A4 and aldehyde oxidase, but also involves CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 to a lesser extent. Transport-wise, lenvatinib interactions include P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), ABCG2, and various members from the solute carrier (SLC) family, which may affect its distribution and excretion. No specific carriers have been noted for lenvatinib.

## Pharmacogenetics
Given that lenvatinib is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A and aldehyde oxidase, genetic variations in CYP3A4 could potentially influence its pharmacokinetics and response, although specific pharmacogenetic guidelines for lenvatinib are not well-established. Variants in CYP3A4 may affect the drug's metabolism leading to alterations in efficacy and toxicity. Similarly, transport-related genes like ABCB1 and ABCG2 might also play a role in individual responses due to variability in drug transportation which can affect drug levels and consequently its therapeutic outcomes. Precise pharmacogenetic testing and personalized considerations might be beneficial in optimizing treatment plans, but more targeted research and clinical validation are required to integrate these potential interactions into routine clinical practice universally.
