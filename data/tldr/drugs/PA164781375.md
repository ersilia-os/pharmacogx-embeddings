## Drug Summary
Ibritumomab tiuxetan is a radiopharmaceutical consisting of a murine IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 antigen, mostly found on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes. This drug is produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells and is linked with either indium-111 for imaging or yttrium-90 for therapy, enhancing its use in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treatment. The pharmacodynamics involve the antibody binding to CD20 on B-cells, which allows the radioactive isotope (yttrium-90) to locally deliver beta radiation, leading to targeted cell destruction. The metabolism of Ibritumomab tiuxetan likely involves removal by the reticuloendothelial system through opsonization or human antimurine antibodies when it binds to B cells. 

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary target of Ibritumomab tiuxetan is the CD20 antigen, encoded by the gene MS4A1. This protein is crucial in the development and differentiation of B-cells into plasma cells. The drug specifically binds to the extracellular domain of CD20 presented on B-cells, marking these cells for destruction via the radioactive component yttrium-90. There is no specific mention of any enzymes, transporters, or carriers involved in the metabolism or transport of Ibritumomab tiuxetan, which suggests that its action is largely confined to the cells it targets directly via its radioactivity.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is no specific pharmacogenetic data provided in the description or noted from prominent sources for Ibritumomab tiuxetan. However, variations in genes related to the immune system, like MS4A1, or genes regulating the reticuloendothelial system's activity could potentially influence the effectiveness or clearance of the drug. Since Ibritumomab tiuxetan involves a monoclonal antibody targeting CD20, genetic variations in CD20 itself (MS4A1 gene) could potentially affect the binding efficacy or therapeutic effectiveness of the treatment. Additionally, since the drug is a murine antibody, polymorphisms in genes related to human antimurine antibody responses could also mediate different patient outcomes, although specific polymorphisms and their impacts are not well-characterized in available literature and databases.
