## Drug Summary
Captopril, also known by various names such as Acepress, Acepril, and Lopril, is a well-established ACE inhibitor used primarily for managing hypertension and heart failure. It functions by inhibiting the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), pivotal in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) that regulates blood pressure and fluid balance. This inhibition decreases the formation of angiotensin II, leading to vasodilation and reduced blood pressure. Captopril is distinctive among ACE inhibitors as it is not a prodrug and requires no in vivo conversion to become active. The drug is usually effective when administered in a fasting state, with oral bioavailability between 60-75%, although food can reduce absorption slightly. Metabolism occurs in the liver where it transforms into inactive metabolites, primarily captopril-cysteine disulfide.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Captopril has multiple molecular targets including ACE, MMP2 (72 kDa type IV collagenase), MMP9 (Matrix metalloproteinase-9), LTA4H (Leukotriene A-4 hydrolase), and BDKRB1 (B1 bradykinin receptor). These targets capture an array of roles from blood pressure regulation to inflammatory processes. While enzymes specifically associated with captopril were not detailed in the given dataset, its transport across cell membranes involves various transporters including ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), SLC15A1 (Solute carrier family 15 member 1), and SLC22A6 (Solute carrier family 22 member 6). Furthermore, captopril is also bound by serum albumin (ALB) which could influence its distribution and pharmacokinetics in the body.

## Pharmacogenetics
Regarding the pharmacogenetics of captopril, variations in genes encoding for its targets and transporters may influence the drug's efficacy and safety profile. Genetic polymorphisms in the ACE gene can affect the enzyme's expression and function, potentially altering the cardiovascular responses to captopril. Variants in the ABCB1 gene, which encodes for P-glycoprotein, an efflux transporter that captopril interacts with, could affect drug bioavailability and disposition, thus impacting therapeutic outcomes or adverse effects. The SLC22A6 gene, involved in drug renal secretion, can also play a significant role in captopril pharmacokinetics. The understanding of genetic variations in these proteins could contribute to personalized dosing and improved therapeutic efficacy, though specific clinical guidelines on pharmacogenetic testing prior to captopril use are still under development.
