## Drug Summary
Eliglustat, marketed under the brand name Cerdelga, is a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor used in the treatment of type 1 Gaucher disease in adults. Type 1 Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme acid β-glucosidase, leading to the accumulation of glucosylceramide and subsequent formation of Gaucher cells that can affect organs like the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Eliglustat works by reducing the synthesis of glucosylceramide, thereby preventing its build-up. Cerdelga was approved by the FDA in August 2014 and offered a novel oral treatment alternative to the standard enzyme replacement therapies. Its pharmacokinetic profile varies based on genetic metabolism differences, particularly those related to the CYP2D6 enzyme, affecting drug absorption and systemic exposure. Eliglustat has a specific mechanism that targets the rate-limiting enzyme in glycosphingolipids production without significant off-target activity, making it a targeted and effective treatment for this rare genetic disorder.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Eliglustat acts primarily through the inhibition of the enzyme ceramide glucosyltransferase (UGCG), which is crucial in the synthetic pathway of glucosylceramide. The drug's metabolism involves primarily the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6, with a lesser role played by CYP3A4. This metabolic pathway is pivotal as it dictates the drug's pharmacokinetic variations among individuals with different CYP2D6 genetic variants. Transport through cell membranes is mediated by ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), which might impact the drug’s absorption and distribution. No specific carriers are implicated in the action or transport of Eliglustat, and its activity is well-targeted to its primary site of action without affecting other systems.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of Eliglustat is highly significant, given its metabolism by the CYP2D6 enzyme. Patients undergoing treatment with Eliglustat are tested for their CYP2D6 genotype to determine their metabolizer status, which can be classified as extensive metabolizers (EMs), intermediate metabolizers (IMs), or poor metabolizers (PMs). The dosage and administration of the drug are adjusted based on these results to optimize efficacy and minimize toxicity. CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers and those with indeterminate metabolizer status may not achieve therapeutic drug levels or may require alternative treatments due to differing enzyme activity affecting drug metabolism and plasma levels. Knowledge of a patient's CYP2D6 genotype is crucial in Eliglustat therapy, directing personalized treatment plans in the management of type 1 Gaucher disease.
