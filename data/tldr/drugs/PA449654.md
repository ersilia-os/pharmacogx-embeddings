## Drug Summary
Flucytosine, also known by brand names Ancotil and Flusine, belongs to the class of antifungal agents. It is a fluorinated cytosine analog primarily indicated for use in combination with amphotericin B against serious infections caused by susceptible strains of *Candida* and *Cryptococcus*, including septicemia, endocarditis, meningitis, and pulmonary infections. Flucytosine exhibits its antifungal action by disrupting fungal DNA and RNA synthesis. It enters fungal cells through cytosine permease, getting metabolized to 5-fluorouracil which interferes with RNA and DNA formation in the fungi. This disruption leads to uncontrolled growth and eventual death of the fungal organism. The drug’s activity is also enhanced when used in synergy with amphotericin B. Flucytosine is rapidly absorbed orally, with a bioavailability between 78% to 89%, and is metabolized via deamination to its active metabolite, 5-fluorouracil.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Flucytosine acts on several fungal targets but is importantly recognized for its interaction with DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in humans and thymidylate synthase (TMP1) in yeast. DNMT1 is involved in DNA methylation, a crucial process for fungal cell replication and gene expression, while thymidylate synthase plays a critical role in DNA synthesis by providing necessary nucleotides. Inhibiting these enzymes hampers the ability of the fungus to synthesize DNA and replicate effectively. The absence of specific transporters and carriers in the provided data suggests that flucytosine’s primary route into fungal cells is the aforementioned cytosine permease-mediated pathway, which becomes critical for its antifungal efficacy. No enzymes have been particularly attributed to the metabolism of flucytosine in humans, albeit the transformation into active metabolite 5-fluorouracil likely involves gut flora or fungal cells.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there are no specific, well-validated pharmacogenetic data directly linked to flucytosine, and the provided information does not include genomic data that may predict patient response or toxicity. Pharmacogenetic interactions of flucytosine might hypothetically involve gene variants associated with metabolic pathways of its active form, 5-fluorouracil. Typically, genes involved in the metabolism of 5-fluorouracil like DPYD could be consequential in understanding varying patient responses to flucytosine, particularly considering its conversion in fungal cells or by gut bacteria. Deeper exploration into how genetic variations in cytosine permease might affect drug uptake and efficacy or how genetic makeup influences the activity of enzymes like DNMT1 could offer insight into differential treatment outcomes, making it a potential area for future pharmacogenetic research.
