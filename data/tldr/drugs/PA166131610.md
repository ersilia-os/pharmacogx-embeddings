## Drug Summary
Niraparib, marketed under the drug ID DB11793, is an oral poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor primarily used in the treatment of advanced or recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Approved by the FDA in 2017, niraparib functions by inhibiting the enzymes PARP-1 and PARP-2, which are crucial in DNA repair processes. Specifically, it impedes the base excision repair (BER) pathway, leading to an accumulation of DNA damage in cancer cells, a process termed 'synthetic lethality', especially potent in cells deficient in homologous recombination repair due to mutations in the BRCA genes. This agent exhibits dose-proportional pharmacokinetics with an absorption T_max of approximately three hours and a bioavailability of 73%, indicating good oral uptake.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Niraparib targets PARP1 and PARP2, enhancing DNA damage and undermining cancer cell survival through the disruption of DNA repair by impeding PARP enzymatic activity. The primary metabolic pathway for niraparib involves hydrolysis by carboxylesterases (CES1A1a) to form an inactive metabolite, M1, which can further undergo glucuronidation and other minor transformations. Major transporters involved with niraparib include ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2), known for its role in chemoresistance, multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins (SLC47A1 and SLC47A2), as well as P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), which influences drug bioavailability and clearance. The drug also interacts with serum albumin (ALB) as a carrier, which may affect its distribution and half-life.

## Pharmacogenetics
Niraparib's effectiveness and toxicity can be influenced by genetic variants, especially those in BRCA1 and BRCA2, as the drug induces cell death primarily in cancer cells deficient in BRCA-mediated DNA repair. Genomic variations in the genes encoding the PARP enzymes, the drug's primary targets, may also affect the drug's efficacy. Additionally, polymorphisms in CYP1A2 and CES1 could impact the metabolism of niraparib, altering both drug levels and adverse effect profiles. Genetic variants in transporter proteins like ABCG2 and ABCB1 may influence the cellular uptake and efflux, respectively, potentially altering effectiveness and toxicity. However, specific pharmacogenomic data or clinical guidelines detailing these interactions for niraparib have not been extensively elucidated yet, indicating a potential area for future research, especially concerning personalized dosage and therapy management based on individual genetic profiles.
