## Drug Summary
Bufuralol is a beta-adrenergic blocking agent or beta-blocker that, based on available information, operates non-selectively, targeting multiple beta adrenergic receptors (beta-1, beta-2, and beta-3). Primarily, beta-blockers are used to manage abnormal heart rhythms and to protect the heart from a second heart attack after a first heart attack. They are also commonly prescribed for treating high blood pressure, angina, and certain types of tremors. Despite its described pharmacological activity, specific details about bufuralol's pharmacokinetics (such as absorption and metabolism) and pharmacodynamics are not well-documented in the provided DrugBank data. Moreover, there is no specific indication given for this drug, such as particular conditions or patient groups it is intended for.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Bufuralol interacts with multiple targets, specifically beta adrenergic receptors - ADRB1, ADRB2, and ADRB3, all of which play significant roles in the sympathetic nervous system's regulating effects on various bodily functions such as cardiac output and smooth muscle tone. Interaction with these receptors is indicative of its mechanism in managing conditions associated with cardiac output and vascular resistances such as hypertension and angina. Furthermore, the drug is metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), an important enzyme in drug metabolism that affects the plasma concentrations of many drugs. The data does not report any specific transporters or carriers associated with bufuralol.

## Pharmacogenetics
Bufuralol's metabolism involving CYP2D6 is crucial, as this enzyme exhibits significant genetic polymorphism which affects drug efficacy and safety. Variations in the CYP2D6 gene can lead to distinct phenotypic classifications such as poor, intermediate, extensive, and ultrarapid metabolizers. In individuals who are poor metabolizers (PMs), drugs metabolized by CYP2D6, including bufuralol, may have increased plasma levels leading to higher risks of adverse effects. Conversely, ultrarapid metabolizers (UMs) might under-experience the therapeutic benefits due to rapid clearance of the drug. This genetic variability can importantly guide dosage adjustments and therapeutic decisions to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity. Pharmacogenomic tests may thereby be recommended to determine the appropriate dosing or even the choice of medication. However, wide-scale clinical guidelines and recommendations specific to bufuralol concerning variations in CYP2D6 are not well established and should be inferred with caution.
