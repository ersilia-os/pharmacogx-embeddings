## Drug Summary
Tacrolimus, also known as FK-506 or Fujimycin, is an immunosuppressive macrolide discovered in 1984. It is primarily used post-organ transplantation to prevent the rejection of allogeneic organs, including the liver, kidney, heart, and lung, as part of a regimen that includes other immunosuppressants. Tacrolimus functions by inhibiting the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity, specifically by binding to FKBP-12, inhibiting T-lymphocyte signal transduction and the transcription of IL-2. It has a variable and incomplete gastrointestinal absorption, and its bioavailability is significantly affected by food intake. Tacrolimus is also used topically in the treatment of atopic dermatitis, where it acts as a second-line therapy for moderate-to-severe cases.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Tacrolimus achieves its immunosuppressive effect by targeting FKBP1A (peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase FKBP1A), leading to inhibition of calcineurin following complex formation with tacrolimus-FKBP-12. Metabolism of tacrolimus predominately occurs in the liver via CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A5, leading to various metabolites. Its distribution and elimination involve several transporters and carriers, including P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), ATP-binding cassette sub-family A member 5 (ABCA5), and organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (SLCO1B1). Serum albumin (ALB) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1) are identified carriers, known to impact its pharmacokinetics by affecting plasma binding.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of tacrolimus is critically important for its dosing and safety. Genotypic variations in CYP3A5 significantly affect the metabolism of tacrolimus, where individuals with extensive metabolizer phenotypes require higher doses to achieve therapeutic effects. Additionally, genetic variants of ABCB1 (e.g., rs2032582) are associated with an increased risk of neurotoxicity, underscoring the need for genotypic screening prior to initiating therapy with tacrolimus. Considering these variations allows for a more personalized approach to the administration of tacrolimus, potentially reducing the risk of adverse effects and improving therapeutic outcomes. These pharmacogenomic insights are derived from associations documented in databases like PharmGKB and supported by clinical studies.
