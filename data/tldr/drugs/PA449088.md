## Drug Summary
Codeine, an opioid analgesic first approved in the US in 1950, is derived from the poppy plant, _Papaver somniferum_. It is employed for the relief of mild to moderately severe pain where the use of an opioid is appropriate. The drug can also function as a cough suppressant. Codeine acts by increasing the pain threshold without affecting consciousness or other sensory functions. Though less potent than morphine, it shares similar pharmacological properties, primarily acting through mu-opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS). Typical effects include sedation, drowsiness, and a decrease in cough reflex and gastrointestinal motility, potentially leading to constipation.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Codeine mainly exerts its pharmacological effects via the activation of opioid receptors, specifically the mu (OPRM1), kappa (OPRK1), and delta (OPRD1) opioid receptors. Critical to its metabolism are the cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2D6, which converts codeine into morphine, and CYP3A4, responsible for converting it to norcodeine. UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, mainly UGT2B7 and UGT2B4, are involved in the formation of codeine-6-glucuronide, another metabolite. Codeine is also transported by solute carrier family 22 member 1 (SLC22A1) across cell membranes.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of codeine is significantly influenced by genetic variations in CYP2D6, the enzyme responsible for its metabolism into active morphine. Variants like rs3892097, rs5030655, rs35742686, and rs28371733 in CYP2D6 can lead to poor metabolism of codeine, resulting in reduced analgesic effects and clinical efficacy. Patients with these polymorphisms generally experience diminished therapeutic responses, necessitating adjustments in dosing or alternative therapies. It's essential to consider these genetic factors when prescribing codeine to optimize pain management and minimize the risk of adverse effects.
