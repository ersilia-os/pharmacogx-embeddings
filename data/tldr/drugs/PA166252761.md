## Drug Summary
Fosdenopterin, also marketed under the brand name Nulibry, is a life-saving therapeutic agent for molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) type A. This condition is an exceptionally rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe neurological damage due to the inability to process toxic sulfites. These result from the lack of activity in three molybdenum-dependent enzymes, primarily sulfite oxidase (SOX). Fosdenopterin was approved by the FDA on February 26, 2021, specifically to reduce mortality in patients with MoCD type A, offering a mortality reduction improvement from 55% to 84% within three years. It acts by replacing a deficient substrate required for molybdenum cofactor synthesis, which is essential for the activation of SOX. As a treatment, fosdenopterin holds a significant place as the first approved drug for MoCD type A with no alternatives available.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Fosdenopterin primarily targets the molybdenum cofactor synthesis mechanism by acting as an exogenous source of cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP). The drug compensates for the lack of endogenous cPMP production due to mutations in the _MOCS1_ gene, essential for converting guanosine triphosphate into cPMP. Despite the lack of specific enzymatic information in its breakdown, its metabolism involves non-enzymatic degradation into an inactive product known as Compound Z. Transporters involved with fosdenopterin include SLC47A2 (Multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 2), SLC22A6 (Solute carrier family 22 member 6), and SLC47A1 (Multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1), which may play roles in the renal elimination of the drug or its metabolites.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of fosdenopterin centers around the _MOCS1_ gene mutations responsible for MoCD type A. These gene mutations prevent the normal biosynthesis of molybdenum cofactor, making fosdenopterin critical as it supplements the missing cPMP. Genetic variations in _MOCS1_ influence the severity of MoCD and the efficacy of fosdenopterin. Considering the drug's transporters, polymorphisms in genes such as SLC47A2 and SLC22A6 could potentially affect the pharmacokinetics of fosdenopterin, although specific pharmacogenetic data is not detailed. Future research into how these transporters affect fosdenopterin distribution and elimination and any other genetic factors impacting fosdenopterin's action could enhance personalized treatment approaches for MoCD type A.
