## Drug Summary
Ketamine, known by brand names such as Ketaject and Ketanest, is a potent NMDA receptor antagonist primarily used for its anesthetic properties. Developed in 1963, ketamine provided a safer alternative to phencyclidine (PCP) with fewer hallucinogenic effects. FDA-approved in 1970, it is used in both human and veterinary medicine to induce anesthesia before surgical procedures and as a supplemental agent in various anesthetic protocols. Besides its anesthetic use, ketamine has gained attention for its potential off-label use in treating depression at subanesthetic doses, supported by its ability to enhance serotoninergic pathways and suppress central sensitization. The drug is rapidly absorbed with high bioavailability, undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism predominantly through N-dealkylation and hydroxylation, and its key metabolite is norketamine.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Ketamine primarily acts by antagonizing the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor but also interacts with a broad spectrum of targets including opioid receptors (OPRM1, OPRD1, OPRK1), muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1-5), dopamine receptors (DRD2), and various serotonin receptors (HTR1A-F, HTR2A-C, HTR3A). This wide range of interactions underpins its complex pharmacological effects, including analgesia, dissociative anesthesia, and potential antidepressant effects. The metabolism of ketamine is primarily facilitated by cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4, which play crucial roles in its biotransformation. There is no significant involvement of specific transporters or carriers in its pharmacokinetic profile according to the provided information.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of ketamine is influenced primarily by variations in the cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize it, particularly CYP2B6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9. Genetic variants in these enzymes can affect the rate of Ketamine's metabolism and consequently its pharmacodynamics and side effects profile. For instance, certain polymorphisms in CYP2B6 can lead to either slow or rapid metabolism, potentially altering the anesthetic and psychoactive effects of the drug. Moreover, genetic differences in NMDA receptor subunits (such as GRIN genes) and opioid receptors might contribute to varied responses to ketamine, impacting its efficacy and safety in both anesthetic and antidepressant uses. However, specific pharmacogenetic guidelines for ketamine use based on these genetic variations are still under research and not yet fully established in clinical practice.
