## Drug Summary
Gentamicin is a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic discovered from _Micromonospora purpurea_ in 1963, with multiple brand names including Alcomicin, Bristagen, G-Mycin, among others. It is effective against various bacteria, particularly gram-negative infections such as those caused by _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_. The drug's mechanism involves the disruption of bacterial cell membranes and inhibition of protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. Gentamicin has a notable use pattern due to its efficacy, low cost, and synergistic effects when used with other antibiotics like beta-lactams, which helps in dose optimization and reducing adverse effects. However, its severe potential side effects, namely nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, limit its extensive use. Gentamicin is poorly metabolized and primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Gentamicin targets bacterial proteins such as the 30S ribosomal protein S12 of _Escherichia coli_, which is crucial for its bactericidal action through inhibition of protein synthesis. In humans, gentamicin interacts with transporters including Solute carrier family 22 member 2 (SLC22A2), Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2 (LRP2), and Canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter 1 (ABCC2). These interactions possibly influence the drug's pharmacokinetics by affecting its absorption and elimination processes. However, no human enzymes or carriers directly associated with gentamicin have been specified, indicating a lack of metabolism by standard drug-metabolizing enzymes.

## Pharmacogenetics
Gentamicin's efficacy and safety can be influenced by genetic variations, particularly in genes encoding its transporters. For instance, polymorphisms in the SLC22A2 gene, which encodes an organic cation transporter involved in renal excretion, could potentially impact gentamicin's pharmacokinetics and predisposition to nephrotoxicity. Additionally, variants in ABCC2 (also known as MRP2) could alter the drug's elimination, impacting both efficacy and risks of toxicity. Although the clinical significance of these genetic factors is not fully defined, they highlight the importance of considering genetic testing in optimizing gentamicin therapy to mitigate risks, especially in prolonged treatments where ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity are major concerns. Genetic predisposition to these toxicities does not correlate strongly with drug serum levels, emphasizing the need for close patient monitoring irrespective of dosage regimen.
