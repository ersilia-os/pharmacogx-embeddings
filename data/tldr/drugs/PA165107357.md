## Drug Summary
Cycloguanil is the active metabolite of the antimalarial drug proguanil. As an active metabolite, cycloguanil primarily contributes to the antimalarial effects observed with proguanil administration. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of cycloguanil itself are not well-detailed as it is generally considered in the context of proguanil's metabolic pathway. Proguanil, and by extension cycloguanil, is used in the prophylaxis and treatment of malaria, where it interferes with the reproduction of malaria parasites in the host's bloodstream.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Information about specific targets, enzymes, transporters, and carriers directly associated with cycloguanil is limited. Generally, it is known that the activation of proguanil to cycloguanil involves hepatic enzymes, specifically CYP enzymes. The target of cycloguanil is similar to that of its parent compound, and it primarily works by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) in malaria parasites, which is key to their ability to synthesize DNA and replicate.

## Pharmacogenetics
Cycloguanil's efficacy and metabolism are influenced by genetic variations, particularly those affecting the cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for the conversion of proguanil to cycloguanil. CYP2C19 is notably involved in this metabolic pathway, and genetic polymorphisms in CYP2C19 can affect the drug's activation and consequently its antimalarial efficacy. Genetic testing may guide the use of proguanil, and hence indirectly cycloguanil, especially in populations with variable prevalence of CYP2C19 polymorphisms which impact drug metabolism rates. Additionally, there is potential variability in response due to genetic differences in the target enzyme (DHFR) among different Plasmodium species, which could also play a role in drug resistance mechanisms.
