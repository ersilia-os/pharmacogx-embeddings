## Drug Summary
Abrocitinib is an oral, selective inhibitor of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), primarily used in the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults who are suitable candidates for systemic therapy. Approved by the FDA and the European Commission, abrocitinib targets the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which is pivotal in inflammatory and autoimmune processes. By inhibiting JAK1, abrocitinib blocks the action of several cytokines involved in atopic dermatitis, leading to reduced inflammation and symptom relief. The drug is absorbed rapidly with high oral bioavailability and shows dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. It is primarily metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP2C9, with smaller contributions from CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. 

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Abrocitinib targets several tyrosine-protein kinases in the JAK family, predominantly JAK1 but also shows activity against JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 to varying extents. The inhibition of these kinases interrupts the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, crucial for pro-inflammatory cytokine activity. In terms of metabolism, the drug is predominantly processed by cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C19 and CYP2C9, with additional involvement from CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Abrocitinib and its metabolites are transported by ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1) and several solute carriers (SLC22A1 and SLC22A8), which might influence its absorption and disposition. Serum albumin (ALB) acts as a carrier for the drug, potentially affecting its pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of abrocitinib involves significant interactions with metabolic enzymes, notably CYP2C19 and CYP2C9. Variability in these genes can affect drug levels and potentially influence efficacy and safety. For instance, individuals with reduced function variants of CYP2C19 may experience higher plasma levels of abrocitinib, leading to increased efficacy or toxicity. Conversely, enhanced metabolism due to high-function alleles could reduce drug effectiveness. Since abrocitinib is also a substrate for ABCB1, genetic variations in this transporter could modify drug absorption and distribution, impacting clinical outcomes. Pharmacogenetic testing may offer insights to optimize dosing and maximize therapeutic outcomes while mitigating adverse effects.
