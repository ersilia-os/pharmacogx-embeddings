## Drug Summary
Ataluren, known by its DrugBank identifier DB05016, is a novel orally administered therapeutic specifically approved by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) in patients aged 5 years and older who are capable of walking. Ataluren targets specific genetic defects in the dystrophin gene known as nonsense mutations, which lead to premature stop codons. The mechanism of action of Ataluren allows it to enable ribosomal readthrough of these premature stop codons, promoting the continuation of translation and aiding in the synthesis of full-length, functional proteins. The drug affects the efficiency of termination at these premature nonsense codons with evidence showing marked enhancement in readthrough activities, especially for UGA stop codons. It achieves its peak plasma concentrations roughly 1.5 hours post-administration when taken with a meal, and it is metabolized in the liver and intestines primarily by conjugation through UGT enzymes, particularly UGT1A9.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Ataluren does not have conventional enzyme targets that directly interact with the drug to facilitate its efficacy. Instead, its primary action affects the ribosomal machinery involved in protein synthesis. The enzymes involved in the metabolism of Ataluren include primarily UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-9 (UGT1A9) found in the liver and intestines, which is responsible for the glucuronidation of the drug, leading to the formation of ataluren-O-1β-acyl glucuronide, a minor metabolite in human plasma. Mention is also made of its interaction with solute carrier family transporters: SLC22A6 and SLC22A8, which are known to facilitate the renal excretion of certain drugs, though their specific role with Ataluren requires more detailed elucidation. Additionally, SLCO1B3, another transporter noted, usually mediates the hepatic uptake of various substances.

## Pharmacogenetics
While specific pharmacogenetic data for Ataluren was not detailed in the supplied information, the drug’s mechanism suggests a potential intersection with genetic factors, particularly those governing the function and expression of UGT1A9, which could influence Ataluren's metabolism and efficacy. Genetic variability in this enzyme could potentially alter the pharmacokinetics of Ataluren, affecting both its safety and efficacy profiles. Additionally, variations in genes encoding the mentioned transporters (SLC22A6, SLC22A8, and SLCO1B3) may affect the drug's absorption and clearance, thereby impacting its therapeutic levels and outcomes. Studies exploring these pharmacogenetic associations could provide insights into personalized dosing strategies to optimize therapeutic effects while minimizing adverse outcomes. Such pharmacogenetic delineations could be particularly pertinent given the precision required in targeting specific nonsense mutations in genetic diseases like DMD.
