## Drug Summary
Latanoprost, marketed under various brand names such as Xalatan, Gaap, and numerous others, is a prostaglandin F2 alpha analog primarily used to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in individuals with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. It functions as a prodrug, being activated after corneal absorption. Its pharmacokinetics involve rapid corneal uptake, hydrolysis into the active form, and minimal systemic absorption. Latanoprost exerts its therapeutic effect by increasing uveoscleral outflow, thereby decreasing IOP effectively within hours of administration, with peak effects at 8-12 hours and sustained for about 24 hours. Notably, it offers the convenience of once-daily dosing and has a well-tolerated profile with fewer systemic side effects compared to other anti-glaucoma medications.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Latanoprost primarily acts through stimulation of the prostaglandin F2-alpha receptor (PTGFR), enhancing aqueous humor outflow and thus reducing IOP. This specific interaction facilitates remodeling of the extracellular matrix and modulates matrix metalloproteinases, contributing to decreased outflow resistance. Concerning drug transport, latanoprost interacts with various solute carrier (SLC) family transporters. Notably, SLC22A6 (also known as OAT1), SLC22A8 (OAT3), and SLCO2A1 are involved in its transport, influencing both the ocular and systemic handling of the drug. These transporters aid in the renal and ocular clearance of latanoprost and its metabolites.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic considerations for latanoprost primarily revolve around individual variability in drug response due to genetic factors influencing prostaglandin receptor functionality or expression and transporter activity. Although specific pharmacogenetic data for latanoprost is limited, variations in PTGFR may potentially impact its efficacy. Moreover, polymorphisms in genes encoding SLC transporters like SLC22A6 and SLC22A8 could affect the pharmacokinetics of latanoprost, altering drug levels and thereby influencing both efficacy and side effects. Such genetic predispositions could help tailor treatment plans for better therapeutic outcomes, though further research is warranted to elucidate these relationships.
