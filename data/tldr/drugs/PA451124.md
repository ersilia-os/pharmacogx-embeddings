## Drug Summary
Proguanil, marketed under the trade name Paludrine, is a prophylactic antimalarial drug effective against _Plasmodium falciparum_ and _Plasmodium vivax_. Its primary mechanism involves the inhibition of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, critical for DNA synthesis and cell replication in the malaria parasite. Proguanil is administered orally and is well absorbed, with dosage varying between 50 to 500 mg. It is metabolized in the liver primarily by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes into its active metabolite, cycloguanil. This metabolism can vary significantly among different populations, influencing the drug's effectiveness, particularly in Asian and African individuals where poor metabolism may lead to subtherapeutic levels of cycloguanil, compromising its antimalarial efficacy.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Proguanil specifically targets dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme critical for the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines in the parasite, thereby stopping its reproduction and nuclear division. In the complex life cycle of _Plasmodium_, inhibition at the schizont formation stage in erythrocytes and liver halts further development of the parasite. Key enzymes involved in its metabolism include CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which convert proguanil into its active antimalarial metabolite, cycloguanil. Interestingly, proguanil does not have specific interactions with transportation systems or carriers according to the provided data.

## Pharmacogenetics
Proguanilâ€™s efficacy as an antimalarial can be significantly affected by genetic variations in the cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2C19. Variants such as rs4244285 and rs4986893 in the CYP2C19 gene lead to reduced metabolism of proguanil, thereby affecting the formation of its active metabolite cycloguanil. This reduced metabolism is particularly critical in populations such as Asians and Africans, who may exhibit these variants more frequently, resulting in inadequate therapeutic levels of cycloguanil. Such pharmacogenetic considerations are crucial when prescribing proguanil, suggesting that genetic testing might be beneficial in optimizing dosing to achieve effective prophylaxis in varied populations.
