## Drug Summary
Lisinopril, known under various brand names such as Acebitor, Acemin, and many others, is an Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor (ACEI) primarily used to manage hypertension, heart failure, and acute myocardial infarction. Lisinopril distinguishes itself from many other ACE inhibitors by not being a prodrug, which means it does not require metabolic activation and is administered in its active form. It operates by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, reducing angiotensin II levels, and subsequently decreasing vascular resistance and blood pressure. It also inhibits renin activity and reduces aldosterone secretion. Its oral bioavailability ranges from 6-60%, with a typical value around 25%, and it features a long duration of action suitable for once-daily dosing. Remarkably, lisinopril is not metabolized and is excreted unchanged by the kidneys.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Lisinopril directly targets the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) to prevent the transformation of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a compound that increases blood pressure through vasoconstriction and sodium retention. Additionally, it targets renin (REN), inhibiting the conversion from angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, providing a dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. This drug exerts beneficial effects such as preventing vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and myocardial hypertrophy. In terms of transport, lisinopril involves transporters such as SLC15A1 and SLC15A2, which belong to the solute carrier family and mainly affect drug absorption. The absence of significant involvement with drug-metabolizing enzymes highlights its minimal metabolism characteristics.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there is a lack of specific genomic data provided for lisinopril with regard to pharmacogenetic impacts from standard resources and the provided data. However, it's inferred that genetic variations in genes related to the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., AGTR1, ACE) could influence individual responses to lisinopril, affecting its efficacy and safety profile. Clinical investigations into ACE gene polymorphism, such as the presence of insertion (I) or deletion (D) alleles, have suggested variability in blood pressure response among different genotypes. Patients with the DD genotype might experience different antihypertensive effects or risks of cough compared to those with II or ID genotypes. However, these connections require more validation and clinical correlation to solidify these pharmacogenetic associations.
