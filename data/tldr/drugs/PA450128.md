## Drug Summary
Isotretinoin, known by its popular brand name Accutane (now discontinued), is a retinoid derivative of vitamin A, primarily used in treating severe recalcitrant nodular acne. This medication is indicated for patients aged 12 and above, enrolled in the iPLEDGE program in the US, designed to prevent isotretinoin use during pregnancy due to high risks of congenital malformations. Administered orally, isotretinoin functions through influencing cell cycle, differentiation, survival, and apoptosis which results in reduced sebum production, one of the primary exacerbators of acne. The optimal absorption of isotretinoin is enhanced by ingestion with a high-fat meal. Metabolism of isotretinoin occurs largely in the liver, involving isomerization and hydroxylation, primarily mediated by CYP3A4, yielding several metabolites like 4-oxo-isotretinoin.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Isotretinoin acts principally through targets such as the retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARG) and retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA). These receptors are involved in the regulatory processes that suppress sebum production and modulate skin cell proliferation. Enzymatic metabolism of isotretinoin is predominantly facilitated by the enzyme CYP3A4. This enzyme aids in the conversion of isotretinoin to its various metabolites, which are critical in manifesting the drugâ€™s therapeutic outcomes. Isotretinoin does not utilize any specific transporters notably, but it binds to carriers like serum albumin (ALB), which might assist in its systemic distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
While the pharmacogenetics of isotretinoin is not robustly outlined, preliminary pharmacogenetic data involves the impact of genetic variants in the CYP3A4 enzyme that metabolizes the drug. Variants in CYP3A4 may influence the rate and extent of isotretinoin metabolism, potentially altering its efficacy and toxicity profile in individual patients. For instance, polymorphisms that lead to decreased CYP3A4 activity can theoretically increase drug levels, enhancing efficacy but also possibly increasing the risk of adverse effects. Furthermore, due to its action through the retinoic acid receptors, genetic variations in RARA and RARG could hypothetically affect drug response, though concrete evidence and clinical validation in this area are sparse. The lack of extensive genomic data provided prevents deeper exploration into more specific pharmacogenetic interactions; however, this remains an area ripe for future exploration to optimize treatment outcomes and minimize adverse effects.
