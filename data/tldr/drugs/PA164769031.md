## Drug Summary
Lumiracoxib, also known under the brand name Prexige, is a COX-2 selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It is designed primarily for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee in adults. Characterized by a distinct structure similar to that of diclofenac, lumiracoxib differs from other standard COX-2 inhibitors in its chemical makeup, leading to unique binding properties and high selectivity towards COX-2 without significantly inhibiting COX-1 at therapeutic concentrations. The drug has a rapid oral absorption with an absolute bioavailability of 74%, and its metabolism occurs primarily through hepatic oxidation and hydroxylation mediated by various cytochrome P450 enzymes. Despite its therapeutic potential, lumiracoxib's registration was cancelled in several countries including Australia, Canada, and New Zealand due to safety concerns related to liver failure.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Lumiracoxib acts mainly by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis through the inhibition of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme, specifically targeting the PTGS2 gene product. It shows minimal activity against COX-1 (PTGS1), which minimizes gastrointestinal side effects typically associated with non-selective NSAIDs. The major enzymes involved in the metabolism of lumiracoxib include CYP2C9, primarily responsible for its oxidation and hydroxylation, and to a lesser extent, CYP2C19, CYP1A2, and UGT1A9 which facilitate additional metabolic pathways. This process results in the formation of several major metabolites identified in plasma. There are no specific transporters or carriers identified for lumiracoxib that are relevant to its pharmacokinetic properties.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of lumiracoxib involves significant interactions with the CYP2C9 enzyme. Variations in the CYP2C9 gene can affect the metabolism of lumiracoxib, potentially altering its effectiveness and safety profile in different individuals. For instance, individuals with reduced function alleles of CYP2C9 (such as CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3) may experience higher plasma levels of lumiracoxib due to slower metabolism, increasing the risk of adverse effects, notably hepatotoxicity. There is no specific genomic data provided that highlights other pharmacogenetic relationships, but the interaction with CYP2C9 suggests a need for cautious use and possibly dose adjustments in populations with known genetic polymorphisms affecting this enzyme. This aspect is a crucial consideration in personalized medicine to avoid adverse drug reactions and optimize therapeutic outcomes.
