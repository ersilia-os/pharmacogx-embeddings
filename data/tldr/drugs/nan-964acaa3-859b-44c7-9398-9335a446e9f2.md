## Drug Summary
Capreomycin, known by various names including Capastat, Helpomycin, Kapocin, and Lykocin, is a cyclic peptide antibiotic categorized under the aminoglycoside family, although structurally distinct from typical aminoglycosides. It is produced by Streptomyces capreolus. Capreomycin is primarily used in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) as part of multi-drug regimens especially in cases resistant to first-line treatments. The drug is not absorbed when taken orally and is thus administered parenterally. Its exact pharmacokinetic properties regarding metabolism are unclear, but its pharmacodynamics activity involves bactericidal action likely through protein synthesis inhibition by binding to the 70S ribosomal unit, resulting in fatal abnormal protein production for the bacteria.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Capreomycin acts on Mycobacterium tuberculosis by targeting the 16S/23S rRNA (cytidine-2'-O)-methyltransferase TlyA enzyme, which is a specific RNA-modifying enzyme that plays a crucial role in the life cycle of the bacteria. By interfering with this target, Capreomycin disrupts the normal synthesis of proteins essential for bacterial survival and proliferation. There are no specific enzymes, transporters, or carriers indicated in the available data directly connected to Capreomycin's action or disposition, emphasizing its rather straightforward mechanism involving direct bacterial interference.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is limited detailed genomic or pharmacogenetic data provided directly related to Capreomycin from the source. Nevertheless, considering its inclusion in the aminoglycoside family, it could be inferred that pharmacogenetic variability in genes involved in drug metabolism and aminoglycoside disposition, such as those coding for ribosomal proteins or transport proteins, might influence the effectiveness or toxicity of the drug. However, more specific studies are needed to establish concrete pharmacogenetic associations. Toxicity profiles like hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia associated with Capreomycin also suggest potential areas where genetic variability in ion transport or homeostasis could impact adverse effects prevalence or severity.
