## Drug Summary
Metoclopramide, known under various brand names such as Maxolon, Primperan, and others, is primarily used to treat nausea, vomiting, and gastroparesis, particularly in diabetic patients. It also addresses symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) when standard therapies fail. Available in oral, intravenous, and nasal spray forms, metoclopramide works by enhancing gastric emptying and reducing lower esophageal sphincter pressure. Pharmacodynamically, it blocks dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain's chemoreceptor trigger zone, which contributes to its antiemetic effects. The drug is rapidly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, with variable bioavailability due to significant first-pass metabolism mostly through CYP2D6 and also CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 enzymes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Metoclopramide acts on several key targets: it inhibits the dopamine D2 receptors (DRD2) and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors 3A and 4 (HTR3A, HTR4), along with antagonistic effects on muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1 (CHRM1). These actions promote its antiemetic and prokinetic properties. The drug is metabolized predominantly by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent CYP1A2. Metoclopramide is also a substrate for the transporter protein P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1) and is carried by Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1), influencing both its distribution and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
Metoclopramide's pharmacogenetics reveal significant interactions with genetic polymorphisms that affect both its efficacy and safety profile. Variants in the CYP2D6 gene (e.g., rs3892097, rs1080985, rs16947) significantly alter the drug's metabolism. Poor metabolizers with these polymorphisms may experience reduced metabolism leading to a higher risk of adverse reactions, such as tardive dyskinesia. Additionally, polymorphisms in KCNH2 (rs1805123, rs3815459) and ADRA1D (rs2236554) have been associated with variations in clinical efficacy and the risk of adverse events. Lastly, the ABCB1 gene's rs1045642 variant can affect the patient's response to the drug, although specific to clomipramine in the noted information, it suggests broader implications on transporter-mediated drug interactions. These genetic factors are crucial for personalizing metoclopramide therapy to enhance efficacy and minimize risks.
