## Drug Summary
Chloroquine, known under various brand names such as Artrichin, Nivaquine B, and Resoquine, is an aminoquinolone derivative developed in the 1940s initially for malaria treatment. It was considered the drug of choice for malaria until newer antimalarials were developed. Its use has expanded to include treatments for HIV, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and off-label uses for rheumatic diseases and prophylaxis of the Zika virus. The pharmacodynamics involves the inhibition of heme polymerase in *Plasmodium* species, accumulating toxic heme which kills the parasite. Chloroquine shows a variable oral bioavailability (52-114%) and exhibits a long half-life (20-60 days), which contributes to its prolonged action but also necessitates caution due to the risk of retinopathy and muscle weakness associated with long-term or high-dose use.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Chloroquine's primary mechanism is preventing the conversion of heme to hemazoin in malarial parasites. It also involves in raising the pH in endosomes, which inhibits viral fusion and entry processes relevant to various viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Enzymatic metabolism mainly involves CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 with contributions from CYP3A5, CYP2D6, and CYP1A1, leading to its metabolites like N-desethylchloroquine. The transport through cells is facilitated by ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), which may affect its distribution and excretion, while carriers such as ALB (Serum albumin) and ORM2 (alpha1-acid glycoprotein) also play roles in its transport in the plasma.

## Pharmacogenetics
Variability in response to chloroquine can be attributed to genetic variations in metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Polymorphisms in CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 can influence the metabolism of chloroquine, potentially altering efficacy and toxicity profiles. For instance, individuals with reduced activity alleles of CYP2C8 might experience higher concentrations of chloroquine, increasing the risk of side effects. The transporter ABCB1, also known as P-glycoprotein, has known genetic polymorphisms that affect its activity, which might impact chloroquine's distribution and the efficacy of preventing malaria or other conditions. These pharmacogenetic aspects underscore the importance of personalized medicine approaches in the use and dosage optimization of chloroquine for individual patients based on their genetic make-up.
