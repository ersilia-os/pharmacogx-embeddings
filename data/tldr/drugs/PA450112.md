## Drug Summary
Isoniazid, also known by trade names such as Nicozid, Nidrazid, Nydrazid, Rimicid, Rimifon, Servizid, and Tibinide, is a well-established antibacterial agent primarily used as a tuberculostatic, targeting infections caused by various species of Mycobacterium, including *M. tuberculosis*, *M. bovis*, and *M. kansasii*. It is recommended as the treatment of choice for all forms of tuberculosis where the pathogens are susceptible. The drug works by inhibiting the synthesis of mycolic acids, essential components of the bacterial cell wall. Isoniazid is a prodrug and requires activation by bacterial enzymes to exert its effects. The absorption of isoniazid is effective following oral administration but is notably diminished if ingested with food due to significant first-pass metabolism in the liver, where it is acetylated by N-acetyltransferase and further metabolized primarily into non-toxic metabolites, albeit with a potential for hepatotoxic intermediates.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Isoniazid’s mechanism of action involves several key microbial and human metabolic processes. It targets bacterial enzymes including catalase-peroxidase (katG) and enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase (inhA) of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, which are crucial for the drug's activation and subsequent inhibition of mycolic acid synthesis, as well as dihydrofolate reductase (folA) involved in bacterial folate metabolism. Human enzymes such as NAT2, a spectrum of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6) are involved in its hepatic metabolism. ALB (Serum albumin) acts as a carrier for isoniazid and might influence its distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors play significant roles in the metabolism of isoniazid and its associated side effects. The major gene of interest is NAT2, which encodes arylamine N-acetyltransferase 2—an enzyme responsible for the acetylation of isoniazid. Variations in the NAT2 gene lead to differences in acetylation rates among individuals, classifying them into rapid or slow acetylators. This variation affects the drug's efficacy and toxicity profile, with slow acetylators more prone to drug-induced toxicity, such as peripheral neuropathy and hepatotoxicity. Another pharmacogenetic consideration involves CYP2E1, where specific genotypes may be linked to an enhanced risk of hepatotoxicity in response to isoniazid therapy, which necessitates careful monitoring and potential dosage adjustments based on genetic screening outcomes.
