## Drug Summary
Ivabradine, marketed under brand names such as Bradia and Ivabid, is a distinctive medication primarily used for the management of stable angina pectoris and symptomatic chronic heart failure. Specifically, it is FDA-approved for reducing hospitalization risks in adult patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure characterized by a left ventricular ejection fraction of ≤35%, who are in sinus rhythm with a resting heart rate of ≥70 bpm. These patients are either on maximally tolerated doses of beta-blockers or have a contraindication to beta-blocker use. Ivabradine is also approved to treat the same conditions in pediatric patients aged 6 months and older. The drug lowers heart rate by selectively inhibiting the "funny" pacemaker current (If) in the sinoatrial node, without affecting other cardiac ionic channels. Its pharmacokinetics reveals that ivabradine is best absorbed when taken with food, which increases systemic absorption by 20-30% and has an oral bioavailability of about 40%.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Ivabradine specifically targets the HCN2 gene product, which is part of the potassium/sodium hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 2, exclusively located in the sinoatrial node, where it plays a critical role in heart pacemaking. The modulation of this channel by ivabradine results in a reduced heart rate by prolonging diastolic depolarization. Metabolism of ivabradine predominantly occurs in the liver and gut via the enzyme CYP3A4; this enzyme is responsible for the oxidation of ivabradine and its active metabolite, N-desmethylated derivative. Due to its specific affinity, ivabradine's presence has minimal impact on other drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, making it largely safe regarding drug-drug interactions, although caution is advised when administered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of ivabradine is centered around its metabolism by CYP3A4, suggesting variability in drug response could potentially be influenced by genetic variants of the CYP3A4 gene. However, comprehensive pharmacogenetic data on how specific genetic variations influence ivabradine's efficacy and safety profile is not well established or may not be available publicly. Given the significance of CYP3A4 in the metabolism of ivabradine and potentially affecting its plasma levels, genetic polymorphisms in CYP3A4 could contribute to inter-individual differences in pharmacokinetics and response. Hence, it would be beneficial for future studies to explore this area to better tailor heart failure treatment with ivabradine based on individual genetic makeup. Such information would be valuable in optimizing doses and minimizing side effects in patients with genetic predispositions that alter CYP3A4 activity.
