## Drug Summary
Loxoprofen, marketed under various brand names such as Loxonin, Loxomac, and Oxeno, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) within the propionic acid class. It is used primarily for the treatment of inflammation and pain associated with musculoskeletal and joint disorders. Loxoprofen has both antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Pharmacodynamically, loxoprofen functions as a non-selective inhibitor of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, crucial for synthesizing inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins. As a prodrug, loxoprofen itself is inactive until metabolized in the liver to its active trans-alcohol form. The drug shows high bioavailability (95%) and is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, although food can slightly reduce its absorption rate.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Loxoprofen targets both COX-1 (Prostaglandin G/H Synthase 1) and COX-2 (Prostaglandin G/H Synthase 2), inhibiting their activity which is essential in the inflammatory pathway. Notably, it is metabolized primarily in the liver via several pathways. Carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) is primarily responsible for converting it to its active form. Other enzymes involved in its metabolism include cytochromes P450 subfamily 3A—specifically CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A43, and CYP3A7—which contribute to the generation of hydroxylated metabolites, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B7 (UGT2B7), which aids in producing glucuronide metabolites. Topical formulations of loxoprofen also involve metabolism by CBR1 in the skin, leading to local absorption and effect.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic variations can affect the metabolism and efficacy of loxoprofen. The activity of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, enzymes known for their genetic polymorphisms, may influence the drug's oxidation rate and the formation of hydroxylated metabolites. Variants in the genes for these enzymes could potentially alter drug levels and effects in individuals, making some more prone to either increased toxicity or decreased efficacy of the drug. Additionally, UGT2B7 is involved in drug glucuronidation, and genetic variants in this enzyme may also influence the drug's excretion and effectiveness. While specific pharmacogenetic data for loxoprofen from studies are limited, these genetically mediated differences in drug metabolism enzymes are well noted in the context of other NSAIDs and could be inferred to affect loxoprofen similarly.
