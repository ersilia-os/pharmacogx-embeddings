## Drug Summary
Rofecoxib, marketed under the name Vioxx, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used for the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, acute pain in adults, primary dysmenorrhea, and the acute treatment of migraine attacks. It selectively inhibits the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme, which plays a key role in the mediation of inflammation and pain. Rofecoxib distinguishes itself from non-selective NSAIDs by not inhibiting COX-1, which is typically responsible for gastrointestinal side effects; thus, it was anticipated to cause fewer gastrointestinal issues. It has a high oral bioavailability of approximately 93% and a biological half-life of 17 hours. Despite its potential benefits, rofecoxib was voluntarily withdrawn from the market in 2004 due to concerns about increased risk of heart attack and stroke.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Rofecoxib primarily targets Prostaglandin G/H Synthase 2 (PTGS2, also known as COX-2), inhibiting its activity and thus reducing the production of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. Another target, elastin (ELN), is less directly related to its primary mechanism of action. The metabolism of rofecoxib is mainly hepatic, involving several cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2, and also PTGS1 (Prostaglandin G/H Synthase 1). Notably, this drug is minimally processed by these CYP enzymes, with most metabolism occurring through reduction by cytosolic enzymes. Transport through the body involves the ABCC4 (Multidrug resistance-associated protein 4), but the drug’s specific carriers have not been identified in the provided data.

## Pharmacogenetics
Genetic variations in the genes coding for COX-2 (PTGS2) can influence the efficacy and safety of rofecoxib, although detailed associations specific to rofecoxib are not widely documented. Variants in cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C8, known to be involved in the metabolism of rofecoxib, might impact drug levels and outcomes. For example, polymorphisms in CYP2C9 are known to affect the metabolism of many drugs, altering drug plasma concentrations, which could potentially modify rofecoxib's efficacy and toxicity. Given rofecoxib’s cardiovascular risks, genes related to cardiovascular physiology and response to COX-2 inhibition (e.g., prostaglandin synthesis pathways) might also be relevant, although specific gene-drug interactions would require further confirmation through clinical studies. These findings underscore the importance of continued research in the pharmacogenetics of NSAIDs, particularly concerning individual risk profiles for cardiovascular events.
