## Drug Summary
Pemetrexed, marketed under the brand name Alimta by Eli Lilly and Company, is a chemotherapeutic agent primarily indicated for the treatment of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and malignant pleural mesothelioma. This antifolate drug disrupts folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication. It inhibits several key folate-dependent enzymes such as thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT). Pemetrexed is unique in its class for its ability to be polyglutamated intracellularly in tumor cells, which prolongs its activity by enhancing its retention and inhibitory effect within malignant cells. The drug demonstrates dose-proportional pharmacokinetics with minimal liver metabolism, primarily eliminated unchanged by renal excretion. 

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Pemetrexed has several molecular targets that contribute to its antineoplastic effects, including TYMS (Thymidylate synthase), DHFR (Dihydrofolate reductase), ATIC (Bifunctional purine biosynthesis protein PURH), and GART (Trifunctional purine biosynthetic protein adenosine-3). It utilizes transport systems such as the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein for cellular uptake. Key enzymes involved in its activation include SLC29A1 (Equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1) and DCK (Deoxycytidine kinase). Transporters like SLC19A1 (Folate transporter 1), SLC46A1 (Proton-coupled folate transporter), and multiple SLC22 family members, along with ABC transporters (ABCG2 and ABCC5), play roles in drug disposition. The primary carrier of pemetrexed in blood is ALB (Serum albumin).

## Pharmacogenetics
Pemetrexed pharmacogenetics primarily involves genes related to its transport, metabolism, and targets. Variability in the activity or expression of folate pathway genes such as TYMS, DHFR, and GART might influence clinical outcomes. For example, genetic polymorphisms in DHFR and TYMS can alter enzyme activity, potentially affecting the efficacy and toxicity of pemetrexed. Transporters involved in drug uptake like SLC19A1 and efflux like ABCG2 also exhibit genetic variability that can impact drug effectiveness and side effects. Genomic aberrations in enzymes like DCK, which are integral to drug activation, could further modify therapeutic responses. Currently, personalized dosing based on these genetic variations isn't standard practice, but ongoing research could lead to tailored treatments to enhance efficacy and minimize toxicity.
