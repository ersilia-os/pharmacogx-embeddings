## Drug Summary
Axitinib, marketed under the trade name Inlyta®, is a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor used primarily to treat renal cell carcinoma. It exhibits a high degree of selectivity for vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3), and by targeting these receptors, Axitinib disrupts angiogenesis, which is crucial for tumor growth and metastasis. Axitinib is known for its potency, being 50-450 times more effective than first-generation VEGFR inhibitors. The drug is administered orally, reaches its maximum plasma concentration within 2.5 to 4.1 hours following a 5 mg dose, and is primarily metabolized by hepatic enzymes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Axitinib effectively targets the tyrosine kinase receptors: FLT1 (VEGFR-1), KDR (VEGFR-2), and FLT4 (VEGFR-3), thereby inhibiting the pathways essential for the development and dissemination of cancer cells. It undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism predominantly via CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. It is also metabolized, to a lesser extent, by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and UGT1A1. In addition, Axitinib interacts with transporters such as ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1) and SLCO1B1 (solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1), which can influence both the distribution and excretion of the medication.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of Axitinib are significantly influenced by variations in genes encoding for its metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Variants in the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 genes can affect the metabolism of Axitinib, impacting both its efficacy and toxicity. Patients with variant alleles of CYP3A5, which result in decreased enzymatic activity, might experience higher plasma levels of the drug, potentially leading to an increased risk of side effects, unless the dose is adjusted. Similarly, polymorphisms in ABCB1 and SLCO1B1 might alter the drug’s pharmacokinetics, affecting its absorption and clearance. These genetic variations should be considered to optimize therapy with Axitinib, enhancing therapeutic outcomes and minimizing adverse effects.
