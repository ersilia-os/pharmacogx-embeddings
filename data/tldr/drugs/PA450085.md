## Drug Summary
Irinotecan, also known as Biotecan and Campto, is an antineoplastic enzyme inhibitor predominantly used for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer when combined with other agents like 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin. It holds approval for other cancers such as small cell lung cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and is under investigation for cervical cancer. Irinotecan operates by interfering with topoisomerase I, an enzyme that facilitates DNA replication and repair, causing double-strand DNA breaks and resultant cell death. It is metabolized in the liver, primarily by carboxylesterase enzymes to its active metabolite SN-38, which is further processed by UGT1A1 among others. Following administration, the drug demonstrates a high plasma concentration and bioavailability, indicating substantial systemic exposure.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Irinotecan targets DNA topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) and its mitochondrial variant (TOP1MT), inhibiting their ability to religate single-strand breaks in DNA. This results in cytotoxic double-stranded DNA breaks upon interaction with DNA replication machinery. It is metabolized in the liver, with enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2B6, CYP3A7, and carboxylesterases CES1 and CES2 contributing to its biotransformation. SN-38, the active metabolite, is further metabolized by UGT1A1 and UGT1A9. The drug and its metabolites are transported by several membrane transporters, including SLC22A3, SLCO1B1, and members of the ABC transporter family (ABCC1, ABCG2, ABCB1, ABCC2), which can impact its absorption and elimination, and may affect the drug's efficacy and toxicity.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of irinotecan is critical in personalizing therapy to maximize efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Genetic variations in UGT1A1, particularly the *UGT1A1*28 allele (rs8175347), significantly affect the metabolism of SN-38, leading to an increased risk of neutropenia and bone marrow toxicity in carriers. The rs4149056 variant in SLCO1B1 is associated with reduced transport activity, leading to higher plasma concentrations of the active metabolite and potentially increased toxicity. These pharmacogenetic associations emphasize the importance of genetic testing prior to initiating therapy with irinotecan to adjust dosing and avoid severe adverse effects, particularly in the metabolism and transport pathways of the drug.
