## Drug Summary
Nicorandil is marketed under various brand names such as Ikorel, Sigmart, and others, and is primarily used for the prevention and treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris and for reducing the risk of acute coronary syndromes. While not approved by the FDA, Nicorandil is available in several regions including the UK, Australia, Europe, and parts of Asia. It works as a dual-action drug that includes vasodilatory and antianginal effects, achieved through potassium channel opening and nitrate properties. The drug is absorbed well orally, with an approximate bioavailability of 75%, and peak plasma concentrations reached within 30-60 minutes post-administration. It undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism, with its metabolites being primarily excreted via urine.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Nicorandil functions primarily by targeting the ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 9 (ABCC9), a regulatory component of the ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K_ATP channels) in the smooth muscle cells. These channels modulate cardiac and smooth muscle membrane potential and cellular protection under stress by controlling potassium ion flux. Nicorandil specifically binds to and activates the sulfonylurea receptor 2B (SUR2B) component of the ABCC9 channel, leading to membrane hyperpolarization and vascular smooth muscle relaxation. No specific enzymes, transporters, or carriers are associated with its metabolic pathway in the provided dataset. The drugâ€™s vasodilatory mechanism also involves the nitric oxide (NO) pathway, further enhancing its antianginal efficacy.

## Pharmacogenetics
Presently, the pharmacogenetics of Nicorandil is not extensively characterized, with no specific genomic data provided in the dataset. However, given its interaction with the ABCC9 gene, polymorphisms in this gene might influence the drug's efficacy or tolerability in patients. Studies on genetic variations in the ABCC9 gene could potentially explain interpatient variability in response to Nicorandil. For instance, variations in the gene could impact the drug's ability to induce necessary potassium channel activities, thereby affecting its vascular and cardioprotective benefits. However, clinical genomic insights and broader studies are necessary to confirm such associations and to develop personalized therapeutic approaches based on genetic profiles.
