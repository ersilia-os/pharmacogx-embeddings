## Drug Summary
Bosentan is marketed under the trade name Tracleer and is a dual endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA). It is primarily used to manage pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in patients exhibiting WHO Class III or IV symptoms, aiming to enhance exercise capacity and decrease clinical worsening rates. The drug operates by inhibiting the actions of endothelin, a potent vasoconstrictor, thus counteracting its negative effects on blood vessel constriction and high blood pressure. Bosentan shows an approximate 50% absolute bioavailability, and its ingestion with food does not impact its absorption.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Bosentan's key pharmacological targets are the endothelin receptors, specifically type A (EDNRA) and type B (EDNRB), where it functions as a competitive antagonist with a slight preference for EDNRA. The drug is mainly metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, with a possible involvement of CYP2C19. Among the metabolites produced, Ro 48-5033 is pharmacologically active, contributing to 10-20% of the drug's overall activity. Bosentan is recognized as a substrate for the ABCB11 transporter, commonly known as the bile salt export pump, but has no reported carriers.

## Pharmacogenetics
While the specific pharmacogenetic data on Bosentan is not detailed in the provided dataset, typical pharmacogenetic considerations involve its metabolism via CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 isozymes. Polymorphisms in these genes, particularly CYP2C9, can significantly alter the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. For example, individuals with certain variants of CYP2C9 may exhibit decreased metabolism of CYP2C9 substrates, potentially leading to enhanced drug exposure and risk of adverse effects. Similarly, variants in CYP3A4 could affect Bosentan handling, although its broad substrate and inhibitor profile across multiple CYP enzymes could complicate such relationships. Continuous research and patient genetic profiling might provide further insights and optimize individual responses to Bosentan therapy, especially in polymorphic populations.
