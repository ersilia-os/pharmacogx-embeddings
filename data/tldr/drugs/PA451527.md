## Drug Summary
Sufentanil, sold under various brand names including _Chronogesic, Disufen, Fastfen, Sufenta Forte, Sufenta mite, Sufentil,_ and _Zuftil_, is a synthetic opioid analgesic primarily used in anesthesia and pain management. It is notably potent, approximately 5 to 10 times as potent as fentanyl, depending on its use. The drug can be administered intravenously, epidurally, or sublingually. Sufentanil acts on the central nervous system by providing analgesia and sedation, significantly affecting pain perception and tolerance. It is indicated for use as an adjunct in balanced anesthesia, as a primary anesthetic agent in major surgeries, for epidural analgesia during labor, and for acute pain management in adults under medically supervised settings. The drug is metabolized predominantly in the liver and small intestine and exhibits a bioavailability of 52% for sublingual forms, which decreases with repeated dosing.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Sufentanil primarily targets μ-opioid receptors (OPRM1), but also influences δ-type (OPRD1) and κ-type (OPRK1) opioid receptors, facilitating its potent analgesic and sedative effects. These receptors modulate synaptic transmission by decreasing neurotransmitter release through the inhibition of adenylate cyclase and alteration of ion channel permeabilities. Sufentanil is metabolized by the enzyme CYP3A4, involved in oxidative N- and O-dealkylation processes. As for transporters and carriers, there are no specific interactions detailed, which suggests a straightforward pharmacokinetic profile without active involvement of transport mechanisms.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetics, variations in the CYP3A4 enzyme can significantly influence the metabolism of sufentanil, altering its efficacy and safety profile. Individuals with polymorphisms in the CYP3A4 gene may show different rates of drug clearance, potentially leading to varying levels of drug exposure. Genetic variations in opioid receptors (OPRM1, OPRD1, OPRK1) could also modulate patient response to sufentanil, affecting pain relief efficacy and risk of side effects. Additionally, genetic predispositions to opioid addiction or heightened sensitivity to opioid-induced respiratory depression may impact clinical decisions around sufentanil use. However, specific pharmacogenetic markers guiding sufentanil use are not currently well-established in clinical settings, indicating an area for future research and potential personalized medicine applications.
