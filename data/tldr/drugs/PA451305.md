## Drug Summary
Saquinavir is an antiretroviral drug belonging to the class of HIV-1 protease inhibitors, primarily used in combination therapy for the management of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection. Introduced in 1995, it was the first protease inhibitor approved by the FDA. Its use in combination with ritonavir, another protease inhibitor, significantly improves its oral bioavailability from around 4% by inhibiting enzymes responsible for its first-pass metabolism. This co-administration enhances the serum concentrations and the therapeutic efficacy of saquinavir. Saquinavir specifically inhibits the HIV-1 protease enzyme, pivotal in the viral replication cycle, blocking the maturation of new viruses. However, it has poor oral bioavailability alone and is extensively metabolized primarily by the liver, involving major CYP450 enzymes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Saquinavir targets the HIV-1 protease, part of the pol gene product, inhibiting a crucial step in the viral life cycle and leading to the production of immature, non-infectious viral particles. It is metabolized predominantly by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, specifically CYP3A4, with minor contributions from CYP2D6, CYP2C8, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7. The drug’s interaction with transport proteins includes P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), various solute carrier family members (e.g., SLC22A1, SLCO1A2, SLCO1B1, SLCO2B1), and ATP-binding cassette transporters like ABCG2 and ABCB11. Saquinavir also binds to serum proteins such as Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1) and albumin (ALB), affecting its distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
Saquinavir's efficacy and safety profile can be significantly influenced by genetic variations in metabolizing enzymes and transporters. The predominant role of CYP3A4 in its metabolism suggests that genetic polymorphisms in the CYP3A4 gene can alter the pharmacokinetics of saquinavir, leading to variability in drug plasma levels among individuals. Variations in CYP3A5 might also contribute to differences in metabolism rates, potentially requiring dose adjustments. Furthermore, polymorphisms in genes encoding transport proteins like ABCB1 can affect the drug’s absorption and distribution, influencing therapeutic outcomes and side effects. While there is limited direct clinical data linking specific genetic variants to differences in response or toxicity with saquinavir, the interplay of these pharmacogenetic factors is crucial in optimizing antiretroviral therapy for individual patients.
