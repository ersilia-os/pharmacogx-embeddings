## Drug Summary
Sacubitril is a neprilysin inhibitor used primarily in combination with valsartan under the brand name Entresto, to manage chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association Class II-IV) with reduced ejection fraction. Approved by the FDA in 2015 following a priority review, it serves as an advanced option, generally replacing classical ACE inhibitors or ARBs in heart failure regimens. Sacubitril is a prodrug whose active metabolite, LBQ657, inhibits the enzyme neprilysin. This enzyme is responsible for the breakdown of natriuretic peptides such as ANP and BNP, which are involved in vasodilation, natriuresis, and diuresis. By inhibiting neprilysin, Sacubitril leads to increased levels of these peptides, thereby enhancing their cardiovascular and renal effects. It exhibits a quick absorption rate (peaking at about 0.5 hours for Sacubitril and 2 hours for its metabolite) and has an oral bioavailability exceeding 60%.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Sacubitril targets the enzyme neprilysin (gene symbol MME), crucial for its mechanism of action in increasing natriuretic peptide levels. It is metabolized into its active form LBQ657 by esterases, which then affects the neprilysin activity leading to pharmacological effects. Transporter proteins associated with Sacubitril include SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3, belonging to the solute carrier organic anion transporter family. These transporters may impact the distribution and elimination of either Sacubitril or its metabolites, influencing drug kinetics and potentially the response variability among patients.

## Pharmacogenetics
Sacubitril's pharmacogenetic implications primarily involve its interaction with transporters like SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3. Variants in these genes can alter transporter activity, which may affect the pharmacokinetics of Sacubitril and its metabolites. For instance, polymorphisms in SLCO1B1 have been linked to variations in the transport activity for various drugs, potentially also impacting Sacubitril. However, specific pharmacogenetic guidelines or allele-related dosing adjustments for Sacubitril are not well established within current clinical practice, necessitating further research to fully elucidate these relationships. Understanding these genetic influences could pave the way for more tailored treatments and improved outcomes in heart failure management.
