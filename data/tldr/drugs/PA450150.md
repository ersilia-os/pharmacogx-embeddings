## Drug Summary
Ketorolac, known by various brand names such as Bedoral, Dolten, and others, belongs to the class of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It is utilized primarily for short-term management of moderate to severe acute pain that might otherwise require opioids, making it a valuable tool in postsurgical pain management and conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, menstrual disorders, and various other acute pain scenarios. Ketorolac can be administered orally, intramuscularly, or via nasal spray, and is known for its high bioavailability (approximately 80% after oral administration) and rapid absorption, achieving peak plasma concentrations within 20-60 minutes. The drug is heavily metabolized in the liver primarily through glucuronic acid conjugation, with enzymes like CYP2C9 playing a significant role in its phase I metabolism. Due to associated risks such as gastrointestinal complications and increased bleeding, its use is recommended for no more than 5 days.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Ketorolac acts primarily by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymesâ€”COX-1 and COX-2, which are involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid, substances that mediate inflammation, pain, and fever. The non-selective inhibition of these enzymes mainly explains both its therapeutic effects and adverse side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding and ulceration. The enzyme kinetics reveal that distinct cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP2C8 and CYP2C9, along with the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B7 (UGT2B7), are involved in the metabolism of ketorolac which facilitates its conjugation and subsequent excretion.

## Pharmacogenetics
Ketorolac's interaction with enzymes like CYP2C9 and its metabolism by UGT2B7 points to the potential influence of genetic variants on its pharmacokinetics and dynamics. For example, polymorphisms in CYP2C9 can affect the metabolism rate of ketorolac, potentially leading to variations in drug levels and effects among individuals. Similarly, variations in UGT2B7 might alter the conjugation efficiency, impacting drug clearance. While direct pharmacogenomic data specific to ketorolac might be limited, understanding the role of these enzymatic pathways provides a foundation for predicting individual variability in response to the drug, warranting caution and possible dose adjustments based on the genetic profile of patients. It underscores the need for further research in ketorolac's pharmacogenetics to optimize its use and reduce adverse effects in diverse patient populations.
