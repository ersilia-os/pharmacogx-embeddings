## Drug Summary
Levamisole, also known by brand names Ergamisol and Ketrax, is an antihelminthic drug initially used in 1969 for treating worm infestations. It gained FDA approval in 1990 as an adjuvant treatment in combination with fluorouracil for colon cancer after surgical resection. Its initial applications also included treatments for rheumatoid arthritis and as an adjuvant in various cancers. The drug possesses immunomodulatory effects, enhancing immune responses and has been studied for various immune-mediated ailments. Pharmacodynamically, Levamisole acts as an immunostimulant, increasing natural killer cells and activated T-cells. Its mechanism involves activity on the L-subtype nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in nematode muscles and it has complex effects on the immune system, including stimulation of monocyte, macrophage functions, and enhancing T-cell activation. Absorption is rapid from the gastrointestinal tract and metabolism is primarily hepatic, encompassing both active and inactive metabolites. Levamisole was withdrawn from the American market in 2000 due to serious adverse effects like agranulocytosis and sometimes found as an adulterant in cocaine.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Levamisole targets multiple acetylcholine receptor subunits primarily in nematodes, indicative of its specific action against parasitic worms. The targets include CHRNA3 (neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-3) in humans, and several in Caenorhabditis elegans: unc-38, unc-63, lev-1, and unc-29. These targets explain its anthelmintic properties, where it likely impairs the nematode’s muscle control and reproductive capabilities by agonistic actions. The pharmacodynamics comments on the interactive role of Levamisole within the immune system, enhancing cellular responses and functions, though details of specific transporters or enzyme systems in humans are not provided. 

## Pharmacogenetics
Given the absence of detailed pharmacogenetic data in the provided document and limited accessibility to full pharmacogenetics literature for Levamisole, precise gene-drug interaction insights are sparse. Historically, the drug’s widespread use in distinct capacities suggests a potential variation in patient response based on individual genetic makeup, particularly in how it modulates immune functions. The immunomodulatory effects could be influenced by genetic variations in immune system receptors and signalling pathways. Notably, the association of Levamisole with severe adverse effects like agranulocytosis could potentially be explored for pharmacogenetic links, hypothesizing that differences in genes related to immune function or drug metabolism might predispose certain individuals to these risks. More focused studies would be needed to substantiate these relationships.
