## Drug Summary
Fluvoxamine, marketed under various names such as Dumirox, Faverin, Fevarin, Floxyfral, and Maveral, is an antidepressant belonging to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) class. Primarily used for treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and depression, Fluvoxamine was introduced clinically in 1983. Its pharmacodynamics involve potent inhibition of serotonin reuptake in the central nervous system, which is believed to underpin its therapeutic effects. The drug's absorption is moderate with a bioavailability of around 53%, and it is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily via several cytochrome P450 isozymes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Fluvoxamine acts on the 'Sodium-dependent serotonin transporter' (SLC6A4), crucial for its SSRIs activity, by blocking serotonin reuptake at neuronal membranes which enhances serotonin's effects. Regarding cardiac ion channels, it affects 'Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2' (KCNH2), although the clinical significance of this interaction remains less clear. Metabolically, it involves multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and others, essential for its hepatic breakdown. It is also a substrate for the transporters ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1) and ABCB11 (Bile salt export pump), which may influence its distribution and excretion.

## Pharmacogenetics
Fluvoxamine's pharmacogenetics primarily revolves around its metabolism mediated by CYP2D6. Variants like rs35742686, rs3892097, rs5030655, rs1135824, and rs28371733 in CYP2D6 gene significantly impact its metabolic rate, leading to poor drug metabolism. Patients with these polymorphisms may experience altered drug efficacy and increased risk of adverse effects, prompting consideration for dose adjustment or alternative therapies. Genetic testing for CYP2D6 variants can be a valuable tool for optimizing Fluvoxamine therapy, ensuring both efficacy and safety in managing depressive and obsessive-compulsive disorders.
