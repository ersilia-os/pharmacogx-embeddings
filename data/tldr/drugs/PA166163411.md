## Drug Summary
Dasabuvir is a direct-acting antiviral (DAA) used predominantly in the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C, specifically for genotype 1 infections. It functions as a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B), which is critical for viral replication. This drug is typically administered as part of a combination therapy, known under the brand name Viekira Pak, which includes other antivirals that target different stages of the HCV lifecycle. Dasabuvir achieves high efficacy, evidenced by its role in achieving a sustained virologic response (SVR), which drastically reduces liver-related complications and improves patient quality of life. Dasabuvir has a bioavailability of 70%, reaches peak plasma concentrations in about 4 hours post-administration, and is predominantly metabolized by CYP2C8.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary target of Dasabuvir is the NS5B nonstructural protein 5B of the HCV, into which it binds, causing a conformation change and halting viral RNA elongation. The drug shows selective activity against genotypes 1a and 1b due to specific interactions with the palm domain of NS5B. Metabolism of Dasabuvir is primarily facilitated by CYP2C8, with additional involvement of CYP3A4 and UGT1A1, indicating significant hepatic processing. Transport of Dasabuvir, and possibly its metabolites, involves multiple transporters including ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2), ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), and ABCB5. Despite extensive data on transporters and metabolism, no specific carriers are currently identified for Dasabuvir.

## Pharmacogenetics
Given the involvement of CYP2C8 in the metabolism of Dasabuvir, genetic variants in the CYP2C8 gene can influence its pharmacokinetics and potentially the overall therapeutic efficacy and safety. Variants affecting CYP2C8 activity could alter drug levels, modifying risk for either under-treatment or adverse effects. Similarly, variants in genes encoding the ABC transporters—particularly ABCB1, ABCG2, and ABCB5—might impact drug distribution and elimination, influencing exposure and response. While specific pharmacogenomic data for Dasabuvir is not extensively elucidated in major databases or guidelines, these genetic components underline the possible scope for personalized dosing or monitoring strategies to optimize efficacy and minimize toxicity, especially in populations with diverse genetic backgrounds. Further studies are needed to robustly integrate pharmacogenetic insights into routine clinical practice concerning Dasabuvir therapy.
