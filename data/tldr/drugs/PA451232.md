## Drug Summary
Remifentanil, marketed under the name Ultiva, is a potent ultra short-acting synthetic opioid used primarily during surgery for pain relief and as an adjunct to anesthesia. It belongs to the opioid therapeutic class and acts specifically as a mu-type-opioid receptor agonist. This mechanism of action leads to a reduction in sympathetic nervous system tone, causing significant analgesia and respiratory depression. The pharmacokinetics of Remifentanil are notable for its rapid onset and short duration of action, primarily due to its metabolism through hydrolysis by nonspecific blood and tissue esterases rather than through the liver. This unique metabolism makes it particularly useful during surgeries that require quick recovery times.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Remifentanil primarily targets the mu-type opioid receptor (OPRM1), but it also has affinity for delta-type (OPRD1) and kappa-type (OPRK1) opioid receptors. The activation of these receptors is responsible for its analgesic effects and other opioid-like effects including respiratory depression. Remifentanil does not have listed specific enzymes, transporters, or carriers involved in its action or metabolism, which is atypical compared to many other opioids. Its metabolism by nonspecific esterases results in a very rapid clearance from the body after cessation of the infusion, significantly reducing the duration of its effects.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there is limited direct pharmacogenetic data available specifically for Remifentanil in public databases like PharmGKB or in the genomic data provided by DrugBank. However, as an opioid, the pharmacodynamics and potential variable patient responses can be influenced by genetic variations in opioid receptors such as OPRM1. Variants in this gene might modify the analgesic efficacy and risk of side effects from opioids, suggesting that genetic differences could potentially alter the clinical effects of Remifentanil. Further research is needed to establish precise pharmacogenetic profiles that could predict patient responses to Remifentanil, making its use in clinical settings more personalized and potentially safer.
