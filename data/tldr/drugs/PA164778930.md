## Drug Summary
Creatine, with DrugBank ID DB00148, is an amino acid derivative prevalent in vertebrate tissues and excreted as creatinine in urine. It is primarily indicated for nutritional supplementation and addressing dietary shortages. Synthesized from L-arginine, glycine, and L-methionine in the kidney, liver, and pancreas, creatine is then transported to various tissues, including skeletal muscle, heart, and brain. It plays a critical role in energy storage and metabolism by converting to phosphocreatine, which is essential for meeting short-term ATP (adenosine triphosphate) needs during anaerobic activity. Creatine supplementation is believed to enhance physical performance by increasing muscular stores of phosphocreatine, potentially offering additional neuroprotective and cardioprotective benefits.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Creatine interacts with several key proteins that play roles in its metabolic pathways. It directly impacts various isoforms of creatine kinase, including CKM (Creatine kinase M-type), CKB (Creatine kinase B-type), CKMT1A (Creatine kinase U-type, mitochondrial), and CKMT2 (Creatine kinase S-type, mitochondrial). These enzymes facilitate the conversion of creatine into phosphocreatine, critical for ATP regeneration in muscles. Additionally, creatine transport is mediated by the SLC6A8 (sodium- and chloride-dependent creatine transporter 1), which plays a fundamental role in creatine uptake across cell membranes. Another transporter involved is SLC22A5 (Solute carrier family 22 member 5), which may also impact creatine transportation, although its primary substrates are carnitine and other organic cations.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of creatine involves variations in genes related to its transport and metabolism, which can significantly impact its physiological utilization and effectiveness. Mutations or variations in the SLC6A8 gene can lead to creatine transportation deficiencies, influencing muscle and neurological function. This is particularly relevant in disorders such as cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes, where genetic alterations in creatine synthesis or transportation pathways lead to neurometabolic anomalies. While detailed genomic data on creatine's pharmacogenetics was not provided, literature suggests that individual response to creatine supplementation might also be influenced by variations in creatine kinase genes, potentially affecting the efficacy of creatine in enhancing athletic performance and in therapeutic contexts.
