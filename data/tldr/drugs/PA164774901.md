## Drug Summary
Darifenacin, sold under the brand names Enablex, Emselex, and Xelena, is a medication primarily used to manage symptoms of overactive bladder, such as urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency. Darifenacin functions as a competitive antagonist of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, specifically showing a higher selectivity for the M3 subtype. This receptor specificity is significant because the M3 receptors are principally involved in the contraction of the bladder smooth muscle. The drug has relatively low oral bioavailability, estimated at 15% to 19% for its 7.5 mg and 15 mg tablets, respectively, and it undergoes hepatic metabolism primarily via the enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. The pharmacological blocking of M3 receptors reduces bladder muscle contractions, thereby managing the urge and frequency symptoms of overactive bladder.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Darifenacin exerts its therapeutic effects chiefly through antagonism of the muscarinic M3 receptor (CHRM3). While it also shows affinity for other muscarinic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM2, CHRM4, CHRM5), its action is predominantly and most potently at the M3 subtype, which plays a key role in bladder and gastrointestinal smooth muscle contraction, as well as saliva production. The medication is metabolized in the liver, predominantly by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. This metabolic pathway is crucial for the drug's clearance and can influence both its efficacy and adverse effect profile. No specific transporters or carriers are implicated in the action or pharmacokinetics of darifenacin according to the provided data.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of darifenacin is particularly relevant due to its metabolism by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, enzymes known for their genetic variability. Variants in the CYP2D6 gene can markedly affect the enzyme's activity, leading to differences in drug metabolism rates among individuals. For instance, some variants result in poor metabolizer phenotypes, which could lead to increased exposure to darifenacin and potentially a higher risk of adverse effects. Conversely, individuals with gene duplications may be ultra-rapid metabolizers, potentially reducing drug efficacy due to faster clearance. Similarly, variants in CYP3A4, which also metabolize darifenacin, can affect drug levels and responses. However, specific pharmacogenetic guidelines for adjusting darifenacin dosage based on genetic makeup are not extensively established and would benefit from further clinical validation.
