## Drug Summary
Artesunate is an antimalarial drug belonging to the artemisinin class, specifically used as the first-line treatment for severe malaria in both adults and children. It was developed from artemisinin to improve hydrophilicity and approved by the FDA on May 26, 2020. Artesunate works through its metabolism to dihydroartemisinin (DHA), which engages in free-radical-mediated inhibition of the Plasmodium parasite's protein and nucleic acid synthesis across all erythrocytic stages. This drug showcases a short half-life and acts quickly with a moderate therapeutic index. Besides its antimalarial action, artesunate may produce side effects such as post-treatment hemolytic anemia and hypersensitivity reactions. Its pharmacokinetic profile reveals rapid absorption and conversion to DHA, which achieves peak plasma concentrations shortly after administration.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary action of artesunate and its active metabolite DHA involves the malaria protein EXP-1 from Plasmodium falciparum, influencing calcium adenosine triphosphatase and other parasitic proteins. Metabolism of artesunate is predominantly facilitated by plasma esterases and further glucuronidation by the enzymes UGT1A9 and UGT2B7. Minor contributions from CYP2A6 have been reported. Regarding transport, artesunate and its metabolites interact with multiple transporters; P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), ABCG2, and solute carrier proteins such as SLCO1B1 and SLC22A8, which might affect drug distribution and excretion. Serum albumin (ALB) serves as a carrier for the drug, potentially influencing its pharmacokinetic profile.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of artesunate hinges on its metabolism and transport. Variability in genes such as UGT1A9, UGT2B7, and CYP2A6 could influence the drug's pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, consequently affecting efficacy and safety. For instance, genetic variants in UGT enzymes might alter the rate of DHA glucuronidation, impacting drug levels and response. Similarly, polymorphisms in ABCB1 and other transporter genes may modify the drugâ€™s absorption and elimination, potentially leading to variations in drug exposure among individuals. Despite this, specific pharmacogenetic guidelines for artesunate dosing based on these genetic factors are not currently established, but they underscore the importance of further research in this area to optimize malaria treatment efficacy.
