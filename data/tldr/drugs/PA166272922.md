## Drug Summary
Mavacamten, a groundbreaking myosin inhibitor, is specially indicated for treating adult patients with symptomatic New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-III obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Approved by the FDA in 2022, Health Canada, and EMA, it addresses symptoms and improves functional capacity by hindering myosin interaction with actin, essential for heart muscle contraction. This action helps mitigate the hypercontractility characteristic of HCM. Mavacamten shows a high oral bioavailability (>85%) and achieves peak plasma concentrations within approximately 1 hour. It is metabolized primarily via the CYP2C19 enzyme, with notable involvement from CYP3A4 and CYP2C9.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Mavacamten targets the beta-cardiac myosin heavy chain (MYH7), exerting its therapeutic effects by modulating the ATPase activity of myosin, thus decreasing actin-myosin cross-bridging and the hypercontractility of sarcomeres in HCM patients. This target interaction underpins the myocardial relaxation benefits observed clinically. The primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of mavacamten are CYP2C19, responsibile for about 74% of its metabolism, supported by CYP3A4 (18%) and CYP2C9 (8%). Lesser roles are played by CYP2B6, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP3A5. Currently, there are no identified transporters or carriers specifically associated with mavacamten.

## Pharmacogenetics
Given mavacamten's significant metabolism through CYP2C19, there are inherent pharmacogenetic implications. Genetic variability in CYP2C19, which exhibits both poor metabolizer (PM) and ultra-rapid metabolizer (UM) phenotypes among different populations due to *CYP2C19* loss-of-function or gain-of-function alleles, can influence drug exposure and response. For example, PMs could have higher plasma concentrations of mavacamten leading to increased efficacy or possibly a higher risk of adverse effects, whereas UMs might experience reduced drug levels affecting the drug's efficacy. The known pharmacogenetic profiles of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 could similarly affect the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of mavacamten. These interactions underscore the importance of genetic testing and personalized medicine in optimizing mavacamten therapy for HCM, although explicit recommendations for genotype-guided dosing are yet to be determined.
