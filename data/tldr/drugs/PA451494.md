## Drug Summary
Stavudine, marketed under various names including Zerit XR and Stavir, is a dideoxynucleoside analog used primarily for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections. It functions as a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), specifically targeting HIV-1. Stavudine is phosphorylated in the body to its active form, stavudine triphosphate, which then competes with the natural substrate deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) and incorporates itself into viral DNA. The absence of a 3'-OH group in stavudine prevents proper DNA chain elongation, effectively halting viral replication. Its oral administration is followed by rapid absorption, exhibiting a bioavailability between 68-104%. Metabolism primarily occurs through intracellular phosphorylation, without major involvement of liver enzymes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Stavudine exerts its antiretroviral activity by targeting the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase enzyme, specifically its functions relating to DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) and RNase H activity. This drug operates competitively with dGTP and ends the elongation of viral DNA once incorporated. Notably, Stavudine does not seem to be metabolized by liver enzymes significantly, which is rather uncommon for many antiretroviral drugs. For transport, it uses transporters such as SLC22A6 (solute carrier family 22 member 6) and SLC28A1 (sodium/nucleoside cotransporter 1), which facilitate its cellular uptake. Additionally, ALB (albumin) serves as a carrier protein, likely playing a role in its distribution within the bloodstream.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of Stavudine does not appear to be extensively studied in public databases, and currently, there is limited specific genomic data tied directly to variability in patient responses or adverse effects from clinical use. However, given the involvement of transport proteins like SLC22A6 and SLC28A1 in stavudine's cellular transport, genetic variants in these transporters could hypothetically influence stavudine pharmacokinetics and toxicity. For example, polymorphisms in SLC22A6 and SLC28A1 genes might alter the drugâ€™s absorption efficiency or distribution within the body, subsequently affecting its effectiveness and safety profile. Further research would be necessary to establish concrete pharmacogenetic guidelines and to fully understand the implications of such variants in stavudine therapy.
