## Drug Summary
Dacarbazine, also known by several names including DTIC and DTIC-Dome, is an antineoplastic agent primarily used for the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma and as a secondary-line therapy for Hodgkin's disease in combination with other anticancer medications. It functions as a synthetic analog of the naturally occurring purine precursor, 5-amino-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC). Dacarbazine exhibits various pharmacokinetic properties including erratic, slow, and incomplete absorption, with extensive localization likely in the liver after intravenous administration. Its elimination from plasma is biphasic, leading to initial and terminal half-lives of 19 minutes and 5 hours, respectively, with noted extension in cases of renal and hepatic dysfunction. About 40% of the administered dacarbazine is excreted unchanged via the urine within 6 hours, predominantly through renal tubular secretion.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Dacarbazine acts primarily as an alkylating agent, though it is also suggested to inhibit DNA synthesis as a purine analog and may interact with SH groups. Its known genomic targets include POLA2 (DNA polymerase alpha subunit B) and PGD (6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, decarboxylating), implicating a role in DNA replication and glucose metabolism pathways respectively. The drug’s metabolism is primarily hepatic, involving cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1. It appears dacarbazine does not significantly involve any specific transporters or carriers based on the provided data.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, specific pharmacogenetic data related to dacarbazine is lacking or not well-documented. However, given the involvement of hepatic enzymes such as CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1 in its metabolism, genetic variations in these enzymes could potentially influence the drug’s pharmacokinetics and overall efficacy or toxicity in individual patients. It would be reasonable to hypothesize that polymorphisms within these CYP enzymes may lead to variable metabolism rates, which could necessitate adjustments in dosing or provide insights into differential risk profiles for side effects among diverse patient populations. Additional research and clinical genetic testing might provide clearer guidance on these associations in the future.
