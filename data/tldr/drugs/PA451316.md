## Drug Summary
Selegiline, also known under brand names such as Carbex and Jumex, is primarily used in the management of Parkinson's disease and, at higher doses, in treating depression. It acts as a selective and irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), an enzyme responsible for breaking down dopamine in the brain. By inhibiting this enzyme, Selegiline increases the availability of dopamine, thus ameliorating symptoms of Parkinson's disease such as bradykinesia and rigidity. It can be used as a monotherapy or in combination with levodopa/carbidopa when the response to the latter decreases. Additionally, it is used in milder cases of Alzheimer's disease for palliative treatment. Selegiline is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; however, specific details on its metabolism are not provided in the provided data.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Selegiline has a specific mechanism of action targeting MAO-B, an enzyme crucial for dopamine degradation. At higher doses, it also inhibits monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), broadening its therapeutic use to include depression management. It significantly alters dopamine metabolism by preventing its breakdown and potentially enhancing dopaminergic neurotransmission. Enzymatic interaction involves several cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP2B6, CYP3A4, CYP2A6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, suggesting that it could be subject to various drug-drug interactions. The drug is also a substrate for the transporter protein ABCB1, which might affect its distribution and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of Selegiline involves interactions with multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes which are known for their genetic polymorphisms. For example, variants in genes like CYP2B6, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 might influence Selegiline's pharmacokinetics, potentially altering its efficacy and safety profile. Given the role of these enzymes in drug metabolism, individuals with certain genetic variants might require dose adjustments or experience different therapeutic outcomes or adverse effects. Additionally, the transporter gene ABCB1, known to affect drug transport across cell membranes, also shows genetic variability that might influence Selegiline's pharmacokinetics, particularly its brain availability. It's noteworthy that while specific Selegiline pharmacogenetic associations are not detailed in the provided data, the involvement of these genes could suggest potential interactions that warrant closer monitoring and possible genetic testing in clinical settings.
