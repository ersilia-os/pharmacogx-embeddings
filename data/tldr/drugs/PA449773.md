## Drug Summary
Glucose, also known as dextrose, is a simple sugar and a crucial energy source used widely in both medical and physiological contexts. It is absorbed directly into the bloodstream during digestion and is utilized by cells as a primary energy source or stored as glycogen in liver and muscle tissues. In medical settings, glucose is often administered intravenously to quickly raise blood sugar levels in patients experiencing hypoglycemia or in those who are unable to ingest food. It also serves an important role in metabolic processes and is integral in the synthesis of proteins and lipids.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Glucose itself doesnâ€™t have specific "targets" as traditional drugs do because it is a natural substrate rather than a biologically active compound designed to alter enzyme functions or receptor interactions. However, it is transported across cell membranes by glucose transporters, primarily GLUT family proteins. In muscle and fat cells, insulin stimulates the uptake of glucose through the translocation of GLUT4. In the liver, glucose uptake and release involve the GLUT2 transporter.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of glucose primarily revolves around genetic variations that affect glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Key genes impact the pharmacogenetics profile of glucose include **TCF7L2**, **SLC2A2** (GLUT2), **GCK**, and **IRS1**. Variants in these genes can influence an individual's risk of developing type 2 diabetes or other metabolic syndromes, affecting how effectively glucose is used in the body. Additionally, mutations in the insulin gene (**INS**) or the insulin receptor gene (**INSR**) are directly linked to abnormal glucose homeostasis. These variations can lead to a spectrum of glucose handling anomalies, ranging from insulin resistance to diabetes.
