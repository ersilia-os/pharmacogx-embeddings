## Drug Summary
Nebivolol, sold under various brand names such as Lobivon, Nebicard, Nebilet, and others, is a beta-blocker medication primarily indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Nebivolol is unique among beta-blockers due to its dual mechanism of action as a highly selective beta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist and a beta-3 adrenergic receptor agonist. This dual activity contributes to its ability to decrease vascular resistance, increase stroke volume and cardiac output, and improve endothelial function through enhanced nitric oxide production, without significantly impairing left ventricular function. Its selective beta-1 blocking properties help minimize side effects associated with non-selective beta-blockers, such as respiratory or metabolic adverse effects. Nebivolol also exhibits a long duration of action, maintaining its effects up to 48 hours post-administration, with typical dosages ranging from 5-40 mg daily.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Nebivolol acts on multiple molecular targets, including beta-1, beta-2, and beta-3 adrenergic receptors (ADRB1, ADRB2, and ADRB3 respectively), with its primary action being the antagonism of ADRB1. This results in reduced heart rate and blood pressure. It also has weak activity against ADRB2 and stimulating effects on ADRB3 that promote vasodilation. In terms of metabolism, nebivolol is metabolized predominantly through CYP2D6-mediated hydroxylation and glucuronidation, with additional metabolic contributions from CYP3A4 and CYP2C19. Its pharmacokinetic properties are influenced by serum albumin (ALB) acting as a carrier, although details on specific transporters involved in its pharmacokinetics were not provided.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetics plays a significant role in the metabolism and efficacy of nebivolol. Given its metabolism predominantly by CYP2D6, genetic variations in this enzyme can substantially affect the pharmacokinetics of the drug. Individuals with different CYP2D6 genotypes ranging from poor to extensive metabolizers may exhibit a wide range of bioavailability from 12 to 96%, which necessitates careful dosing considerations to avoid suboptimal effects or adverse reactions. The impact of other genetic factors on the pharmacodynamics and side effects of nebivolol is less well-documented but could be inferred based on typical beta-blocker interactions. This underscores the importance of pharmacogenetic screening or consideration particularly for patients with known variations in CYP2D6 activity or those experiencing atypical responses to the drug.
