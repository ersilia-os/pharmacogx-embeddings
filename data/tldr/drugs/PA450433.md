## Drug Summary
Methoxsalen (also known as Deltasoralen, Meladinine, Meloxine, and Ultra Mop) is a naturally occurring furocoumarin derived from plants such as Psoralea corylifolia. It is used primarily for the treatment of skin conditions such as psoriasis and vitiligo. Methoxsalen is a photoactive substance, meaning its therapeutic effects are activated by exposure to ultraviolet A (UVA) light. This therapy, known as PUVA (psoralen and UVA), involves oral or topical administration of methoxsalen followed by UVA irradiation. The drug functions by forming adducts with DNA when exposed to UVA, leading to the inhibition of DNA synthesis which disrupts the abnormal growth of skin cells.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Methoxsalen works by selectively binding to the guanine and cytosine content of DNA, which results in cross-linking and therefore inhibition of DNA synthesis and function. This action helps in slowing down the cell proliferation associated with psoriasis and in re-pigmenting the white patches observed in vitiligo. The pharmacokinetics details such as absorption, metabolism, and excretion are not provided in the provided data. Regarding enzymes, Methoxsalen is metabolized by several cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, and CYP2A13. There are no specific carriers or transporters listed for Methoxsalen which are significant in its action or disposition.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of Methoxsalen involves its metabolism predominantly by enzymes of the cytochrome P450 family. Variability in the activity of these enzymes due to genetic differences can influence the efficacy and toxicity of Methoxsalen. CYP1A2, CYP1A1, CYP2A6, and CYP2A13 are particularly notable as they metabolize a range of substances including drugs. Genetic polymorphisms in these genes might affect the metabolism rate of Methoxsalen, thereby altering its therapeutic outcomes or side effects. Patients with variations in these genes could either rapidly clear the drug, reducing its effectiveness, or metabolize it slowly, increasing the risk of toxicity. Therefore, genetic testing may be beneficial in optimizing Methoxsalen dosing for individual patients.
