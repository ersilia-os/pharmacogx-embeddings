## Drug Summary
5-HTP (5-Hydroxytryptophan) is marketed under various names including HTP Calm, Natural 5-HTP, and Super 5-HTP. It is used mainly for the temporary relief of symptoms such as nervousness, anxiety, mood swings, joint pains, weakness, drowsiness, itching, and lethargy. However, its use and claims are not evaluated or approved by the FDA, and it is categorized as a homeopathic product. 5-HTP is a naturally occurring amino acid and a chemical precursor as well as a metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT). It is derived from the plant source Griffonia simplicifolia. The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, metabolism, and detailed mechanism of action of 5-HTP in these indications are not well-documented in scientifically controlled environments.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
5-HTP influences several targets related to serotonin signaling. It affects the Sodium-dependent serotonin transporter (SLC6A4), which is involved in the reuptake of serotonin from the synaptic cleft. It also interacts with several serotonin receptors including 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (HTR2A), 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3A (HTR3A), and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3B (HTR3B). Additionally, 5-HTP implicates SLC18A2, known as the synaptic vesicular amine transporter, crucial for the storage of serotonin in vesicles. 5-HTP is also transported by the Solute carrier family 22 member 2 (SLC22A2). No specific enzymatic pathways for 5-HTP were noted in the provided data.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is no explicit genomic data provided in the dataset for 5-HTP pharmacogenetics. However, based on known pharmacogenetics of serotonin-related pathways, variations in genes like SLC6A4 can influence individual responses to 5-HTP. Polymorphisms in SLC6A4, especially in the promoter region commonly known as 5-HTTLPR, have been associated with differential serotonin transport, which could affect the efficacy and safety of 5-HTP treatment. Additionally, variants in serotonin receptor genes (such as HTR2A and HTR3A) may also influence how individuals respond to 5-HTP, potentially impacting its effectiveness for mood disorders and other symptoms. These inferences are based on broader pharmacogenetic correlations within the serotonin pathway and should be further validated by clinical testing specifically for 5-HTP.
