## Drug Summary
Methylprednisolone, also known by brand names such as Medrate, Medrone, Meprolone, Solomet, and Urbason, is a synthetic glucocorticoid derived from prednisolone, exhibiting higher potency compared to prednisone. It was first described in the literature in the late 1950s and received FDA approval in 1957. This medication is used in a variety of medical conditions including endocrine, rheumatic, dermatologic, and respiratory disorders among others. The pharmacodynamics of methylprednisolone involve the binding to glucocorticoid receptors, leading to anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects depending on the dosage. Its absorption varies with different routes of administration, having an oral bioavailability of about 90% compared to methylprednisolone acetate. Metabolism primarily occurs via 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases and various ketosteroid reductases. 

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Methylprednisolone primarily targets the NR3C1 (glucocorticoid receptor) to exert its effects, modulating gene expression which impacts inflammatory responses. Another target, ANXA1 (Annexin A1), also plays a role in the modulation of inflammation and immune responses. Enzymatically, it is metabolized by multiple enzymes including AKR1C1, AKR1C2, AKR1C3, AKR1C4, HSD11B1, HSD11B2, CYP3A4, CYP2A6, CYP1B1, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, and CYP2C9, indicating extensive involvement of the cytochrome P450 and reductase enzyme systems in its metabolism. The transporter ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1) and the carrier ALB (serum albumin) also interact with this drug, affecting its distribution and excretion.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of methylprednisolone includes interactions with various cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7. Variants in these genes can significantly influence drug metabolism, leading to variations in drug exposure and response among individuals. For instance, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 polymorphisms can alter the rate at which methylprednisolone is metabolized, affecting both efficacy and risk of adverse effects. Additionally, polymorphisms in the ABCB1 gene, encoding for P-glycoprotein, could modify the drug's distribution and efflux, potentially impacting therapeutic outcomes. Such genetic variations underscore the need for tailored dosing regimens to optimize therapy and minimize toxicity, emphasizing the significance of pharmacogenetics in clinical settings for drugs like methylprednisolone.
