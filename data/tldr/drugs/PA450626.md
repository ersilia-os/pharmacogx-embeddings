## Drug Summary
Nicotine, marketed under names such as Habitrol and Nicoderm, is a potent alkaloid found primarily in tobacco. It is used medically to relieve withdrawal symptoms and aid in smoking cessation. Nicotine has a complex pharmacology, acting primarily as an agonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in various locations including the brain and adrenal medulla. This action leads to the release of neurotransmitters like dopamine, which are associated with pleasure and addiction. Its stimulatory effects also cause increased heart rate, blood pressure, and peripheral vasoconstriction. Nicotine is absorbed through the buccal mucosa when used in therapeutic forms such as patches or inhalers, and it is metabolized mainly in the liver, primarily into cotinine. The toxicity of nicotine is significant, with symptoms of overdose including nausea, palpitations, and hypotension.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Nicotine's actions are mediated through its binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, including CHRNA4, CHRNA7, CHRNA2, CHRNA3, CHRNA5, CHRNA6, CHRNA9, CHRNA10, CHRNB2, CHRNB3, and CHRNB4. These receptors, when activated, influence neurological processes and endocrine responses. The metabolism of nicotine involves several enzymes primarily from the cytochrome P450 family, such as CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP2A6, CYP2E1, CYP2A13, CYP2B6, as well as amine oxidases MAOA and MAOB. Transport of nicotine and its metabolites involves solute carriers such as SLC22A2, SLC22A1, SLC22A3, SLC22A4, and SLC22A5. There are no specific carriers identified for nicotine.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetics plays a crucial role in the metabolism and effects of nicotine, particularly in its cessation therapies. The metabolism enzyme CYP2A6 is particularly relevant; variations in this gene can alter the speed and efficiency of nicotine metabolism, affecting cessation success and the risk of continued tobacco use. Individuals with certain CYP2A6 variants metabolize nicotine more slowly, possibly finding smoking less rewarding and having a reduced risk of addiction, though this may also impact the effectiveness and dosing of nicotine replacement therapies. Other enzymes like CYP2B6 and CYP2E1 also contribute to inter-individual variability in nicotine pharmacokinetics. Understanding these genetic factors can help tailor smoking cessation strategies more effectively, potentially improving outcomes by adjusting therapies according to individual genetic profiles.
