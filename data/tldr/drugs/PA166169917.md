## Drug Summary
Midostaurin, marketed under the name Rydapt, is a multitarget kinase inhibitor primarily used to treat adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who test positive for a specific genetic mutation in the FLT3 gene. Approved on April 28, 2017, midostaurin was initially developed as a broad-spectrum antineoplastic agent effective against various solid and hematopoietic tumors. It is conventionally administered in combination with chemotherapeutic agents, demonstrating an ability to increase the overall survival rate in AML patients. Midostaurin acts by interfering with multiple wild-type and mutated kinases that drive malignant signaling cascades in conditions such as AML and aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM). The drug shows pharmacodynamic properties of extending QTc intervals, albeit not clinically significant compared to placebo.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Midostaurin potently inhibits several receptor tyrosine kinases including FLT3, KIT, VEGFR2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2), PDGFR (platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha and beta), and Protein Kinase C alpha (PRKCA). These targets are essential for cellular signaling pathways that regulate cell growth and survival, linking directly to the progression of malignancies when aberrantly activated. Midostaurin is metabolized in the liver primarily by the enzyme CYP3A4, along with other cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP3A5, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. Its major active metabolites are CGP62221 and CGP52421, showing a similar but inducible metabolic pathway. It is also noted to interact with the organic anion transporter (OATP) 1A1 and multidrug resistance protein (MRP-2), though these interactions require further investigation.

## Pharmacogenetics
With respect to pharmacogenetics, midostaurinâ€™s efficacy is particularly noted in patients with mutations in the FLT3 gene, a common alteration in AML that leads to hyperactive signaling and uncontrolled cell proliferation. The genetic status of FLT3 significantly influences the therapeutic response to midostaurin, making genetic testing a prerequisite for its administration in AML therapy. Additionally, given the drug's metabolism by CYP3A4 and several other CYP enzymes, genetic variations in these enzymes could potentially influence midostaurin's pharmacokinetics and overall patient response. However, specific pharmacogenetic recommendations based on CYP polymorphisms are not fully established and warrant further clinical studies to optimize treatment regimens and dosages based on individual genetic profiles.
