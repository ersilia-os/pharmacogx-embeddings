## Drug Summary
Ixabepilone, marketed under the trade name Ixempra, is an epothilone B analog developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb for the treatment of cancer. It was specifically approved by the FDA on October 16, 2007, for use in patients with aggressive metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer that has proved unresponsive to other treatments. As a semisynthetic analogue of epothilone B, ixabepilone possesses modifications to enhance its stability against esterase degradation. Administered via injection, its anticancer properties derive from its ability to interfere with microtubule functions, which are crucial for cell division.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary therapeutic action of ixabepilone is mediated through its binding to the beta-tubulin subunits of microtubules, specifically TUBB3 (Tubulin beta-3 chain). This interaction stabilizes microtubules and prevents them from properly dividing, thereby inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. In terms of drug metabolism, ixabepilone is metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme, a member of the cytochrome P450 family, which is significant in the processing of many cancer therapies. Furthermore, its distribution and excretion involve the transporter ABCB1, also known as P-glycoprotein 1, which plays a role in drug resistance as it can actively pump ixabepilone out of cells.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors for ixabepilone primarily involve the enzyme CYP3A4 and the transporter ABCB1. Genetic variants in the CYP3A4 gene can influence the metabolism of ixabepilone, potentially affecting both the efficacy and toxicity of the drug. For instance, variations that lead to reduced CYP3A4 activity could result in higher drug levels, increasing the risk of toxicity, whereas increased enzyme activity could decrease drug effectiveness. Similarly, variations in the ABCB1 gene, which encodes the P-glycoprotein transporter, can affect the drug's distribution and the resistance profile in tumor cells. Patients with variants that enhance ABCB1 activity might be less responsive to ixabepilone due to increased drug efflux from cells. These pharmacogenetic associations suggest potential for personalized dosing strategies in cancer treatment with ixabepilone.
