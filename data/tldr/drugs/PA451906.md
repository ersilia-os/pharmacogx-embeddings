## Drug Summary
Warfarin, also known by brand names such as Lawarin, Marevan, Waran, and Warfant, is a well-known anticoagulant used primarily to prevent the formation and migration of blood clots. Commonly prescribed in North America, warfarin operates by inhibiting the production of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, which are crucial for the blood coagulation process. The drug is indicated for the prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism and its complications, management of atrial fibrillation and cardiac valve replacement associated thromboembolism, and as an adjunct therapy to reduce mortality and recurrent myocardial infarction. Warfarin is rapidly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract with a peak concentration at about 4 hours post-administration. Its metabolism is primarily managed through hydroxylation by cytochrome P450 enzymes, which then undergoes further processing to be eliminated.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Warfarin exerts its anticoagulant effect by targeting and inhibiting the Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1), essential for reducing vitamin K epoxide in the vitamin K cycle, necessary for activating clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. The drug's metabolism involves various cytochrome P450 enzymes, notably CYP2C9, which plays a significant role in warfarin's 6- and 7-hydroxylation processes. Other contributing enzymes include CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C8, CYP3A4, and CYP2C18. Its minor metabolic pathways involve reduction and conjugation processes. Additionally, warfarin binds to plasma proteins such as albumin (ALB), and its hydroxylation products bind to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1).

## Pharmacogenetics
Warfarin pharmacogenetics is critical for its efficacy and safety, predominantly involving polymorphisms within the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes. Specific alleles such as CYP2C9 *2 and *3 (represented by rs1799853 and rs1057910) are associated with a reduced metabolic activity that necessitates dosage adjustments to avoid excessive anticoagulation and bleeding risks. Similarly, VKORC1 polymorphisms like rs9923231 result in variations in warfarin sensitivity and dosage requirements. Genetic testing for these polymorphisms can guide personalized warfarin dosing, improving therapeutic outcomes and minimizing adverse effects. Moreover, polymorphisms in CYP4F2 (rs2108622) can affect warfarin dosing, where variants might increase dosage requirements for achieving the desired anticoagulant effect.
