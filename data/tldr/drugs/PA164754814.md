## Drug Summary
Pregabalin, marketed by Pfizer under the names Lyrica and Lyrica CR (extended release), is structurally related to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), although it exhibits no binding affinity to GABA receptors. It is primarily indicated for the management of various types of neuropathic pain including diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, fibromyalgia, spinal cord injury-related pain, and as an adjunctive treatment for partial-onset seizures. The drug operates predominantly by binding to the α2δ subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels in the central nervous system, which modulates neurotransmitter release and reduces neuronal excitability. Pregabalin is rapidly absorbed with an oral bioavailability of over 90%, achieving peak blood concentration within 1.5 hours. The drug is minimally metabolized and eliminated largely unchanged via renal excretion.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Pregabalin shows high specificity for the alpha-2/delta-1 subunit (CACNA2D1) of voltage-dependent calcium channels, crucial for its anticonvulsant and analgesic effects by modulating neurotransmitter release. While it does not extensively involve metabolic enzymes due to its minimal metabolism, pregabalin interacts with several transporters. Specifically, it interactswith the excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (SLC1A1) and the large neutral amino acids transporter small subunit 1 (SLC7A5). These interactions could influence not only its therapeutic efficacy but its distribution and elimination profiles.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, the major pharmacogenetic aspects of pregabalin focus on its transport via specific transporters which might influence individual responses based on genetic variability. There isn’t significant information on polymorphisms in genes coding for the α2δ subunit (CACNA2D1) directly affecting response to pregabalin, though this remains an area with potential for future research due to the direct binding of pregabalin to this subunit. Genetic variations in transporter genes like SLC1A1 and SLC7A5 could affect the pharmacokinetics and possibly the pharmacodynamics of pregabalin, modifying efficacy and safety profiles in different populations. However, systematic population-level genetic studies would be necessary to establish these connections robustly.
