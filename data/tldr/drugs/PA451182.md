## Drug Summary
Pyrazinamide is a pyrazine derivative that serves as an antitubercular agent. It is indicated for the initial treatment of active tuberculosis, typically used in combination with other antituberculous medications for both adults and children. Pyrazinamide possesses a unique mode of action, targeting the bacteria that cause tuberculosis (TB) and is specifically active against *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. The drug is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, undergoes metabolism primarily in the liver, and exerts its bactericidal effects only under slightly acidic conditions. The drug has known side effects such as liver injury, arthralgias, and hypersensitivity reactions.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Pyrazinamide is prodrug that is converted by the bacterial pyrazinamidase enzyme into its active form, pyrazinoic acid, which targets fatty acid synthetase (FAS) in *M. tuberculosis*. This inhibition interferes with the bacterium's fatty acid synthesis, crucial for its growth and replication. Additionally, pyrazinoic acid disrupts membrane potential and energy production within the bacterial cells, contributing to its antitubercular activity. In humans, pyrazinamide is metabolized by aldehyde oxidase (AOX1) and xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase (XDH), which are responsible for its hepatic metabolism. There are no specific transporters or carriers noted in the provided data for its transport or distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, specific pharmacogenetic data related to pyrazinamide is not extensively detailed. However, considering its metabolism involves enzymes like AOX1 and XDH, genetic variations in these enzymes could potentially influence the drug's pharmacokinetics and side effect profile. For instance, polymorphisms in XDH have been associated with altered activity levels, which might affect drug metabolism and toxicity. Although not directly specified in the drug profile, it implies that individual genetic differences could potentially impact the efficacy and safety of pyrazinamide. Further studies would be necessary to establish more definitive pharmacogenetic associations.
