## Drug Summary
Bumetanide, sold under brand names like Burinex, Fordiuran, and Lunetoron, is a potent loop diuretic belonging to the sulfamyl category, primarily used to treat edema associated with congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and renal disease, including the nephrotic syndrome. This drug is effective where high doses of furosemide might fail, and has a more predictable bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profile. Bumetanide acts by blocking the reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the ascending loop of Henle, leading to increased urine production. The drug is well-absorbed orally, with about 80% bioavailability, and does not get altered by food intake. About 45% of the drug is excreted unchanged, with the remainder metabolized primarily in the liver through oxidation of the N-butyl side chain.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Bumetanide targets several members of the solute carrier family (SLC), including SLC12A1, SLC12A2, SLC12A4, SLC12A5, which play critical roles in electrolyte transport across renal tubules. It also affects the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), involved in chloride and sodium ion transport in various tissues. The drug is metabolized by enzymes such as PTGS2, which may be involved in its inflammatory response mediation. As for its elimination, bumetanide interacts with multiple transporters, including SLC10A1, SLC22A6 (OAT1), SLC22A8 (OAT3), SLC22A7 (OAT2), SLC22A11 (OAT4), and SLCO1A2, involved in its renal secretion and possibly impacting its pharmacokinetic characteristics.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is no specific pharmacogenetic data provided for bumetanide in the provided information. However, given its metabolism and transport involving various enzymes and transporters, genetic variations in genes like PTGS2, SLC22A6, and SLC22A8 could potentially influence the drugâ€™s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. For example, variants in SLC22A6 and SLC22A8 have been studied in the context of other drugs for their roles in altered drug transport and excretion, which might suggest possible similar effects with bumetanide. These associations could hypothetically affect patient responses to bumetanide, such as differences in drug efficacy and risk of side effects, although specific studies and clinical guidelines would be necessary to confirm and implement such pharmacogenetic insights in a clinical setting.
