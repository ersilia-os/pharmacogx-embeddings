## Drug Summary
Ganaxolone, identified as DB05087 in DrugBank and marketed under the brand name ZTALMY, is a synthetic neurosteroid analog of allopregnanolone. It belongs to the class of neuroactive steroids or "epalons" and functions primarily as a positive allosteric modulator of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, enhancing their inhibitory effects. This modulation is distinct from that of benzodiazepines, as ganaxolone binds at different sites on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor. Approved by the FDA in March 2022 and later by the EMA in July 2023, it is indicated for managing seizures associated with CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) in patients aged two years and older. The drug is especially noted for its anticonvulsant properties and lacks the traditional hormonal activity of steroids. Ganaxolone is rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations reaching within 2 to 3 hours post-oral administration. Its metabolism predominates via CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent via CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, forming a major metabolite identified as 16-OH ganaxolone.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Ganaxolone targets multiple subunits of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, including GABRA1, GABRA2, GABRA3, GABRA4, GABRA5, GABRA6, GABRB1, GABRB2, GABRB3, GABRD, GABRE, GABRG1, GABRG2, GABRG3, GABRP, and GABRQ. These receptors are pivotal in mediating the CNS depressant effects crucial to ganaxolone's therapeutic action. The drug lacks specific carriers and transporters but is metabolized by several enzymes including CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. This metabolic pathway principally involves CYP3A4, which is crucial for producing its active metabolite.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there is limited specific pharmacogenetic data concerning ganaxolone in publicly available sources. However, due to its metabolism by enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, genetic polymorphisms in these enzymes could theoretically influence the drug's metabolic rate and consequently its efficacy and toxicity. Specifically, CYP3A5 expressers may have different metabolism rates compared to non-expressers. Likewise, variations in CYP2C19, which is known for its genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism, could impart variability in response among patients. Although these inferences are based on enzyme involvement and known pharmacogenomic principles rather than direct clinical data on ganaxolone, they highlight potential areas for further research and genetic testing prior to therapy optimization.
