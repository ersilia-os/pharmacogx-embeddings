## Drug Summary
Pralsetinib is a kinase inhibitor primarily targeting the RET (Rearranged during Transfection) tyrosine kinase receptor, and has shown specificity over other kinase classes. This drug plays a crucial role in treating RET-driven cancers by blocking oncogenic RET fusions, RET kinase mutations, and serving as a therapeutic option where other multikinase inhibitors fail due to toxicity issues. Pralsetinib is marketed under the brand name GAVRETO™ and was granted accelerated FDA approval in 2020 for metastatic RET-fusion positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and certain types of RET-fusion positive thyroid cancers. The medication's pharmacokinetics reveals variable absorption influenced by food intake, considerable systemic exposure, and a rapid attainment of steady-state concentrations.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Pralsetinib’s primary molecular target is RET, but it also impacts other kinases such as DDR1, FLT3, JAK1/2, NTRK1/3, VEGFR2, PDGFRB, FGFR1/2 at clinically relevant concentrations, although its selectivity for RET is notably higher. The drug is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4 with additional involvement from CYP2D6 and CYP1A2. It affects various transporters including P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2), and several solute carrier family members like SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3, potentially influencing both pharmacokinetics and distribution profiles of pralsetinib and concomitantly administered drugs.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of Pralsetinib mainly revolves around its metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes, notably CYP3A4. Variants in the CYP3A4 gene could influence the drug’s metabolism and thereby its efficacy and toxicity. Considering the drug's interactions with various transporters like ABCB1 and ABCG2, genetic variations in these transporters may also modulate drug absorption and disposition, suggesting a potential for personalized dosing strategies based on individual genetic makeup. However, more detailed studies and clinical trials are necessary to establish robust pharmacogenetic guidelines for pralsetinib.
