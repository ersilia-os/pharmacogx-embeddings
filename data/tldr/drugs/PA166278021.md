## Drug Summary
Mitapivat is a first-in-class pyruvate kinase activator, distinctly indicated for the treatment of hemolytic anemia in adults with pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency. This condition is a rare inherited disorder characterized by insufficient ATP production due to enzyme defects in red blood cells (RBCs), leading to their premature destruction. Mitapivat enhances the activity of erythrocyte pyruvate kinase, both in its wild-type and mutant forms, which is crucial for the anaerobic metabolism of glucose in RBCs. By stabilizing the active enzyme form and boosting its substrate affinity, mitapivat increases ATP production and reduces the levels of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, ultimately alleviating the symptoms of the disease. The drug, absorbed orally with a high bioavailability, shows dose-proportional pharmacokinetics and is metabolized predominantly by the CYP3A4 enzyme.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Mitapivat primarily targets the PKLR gene product, pyruvate kinase, an enzyme essential for glycolysis in RBCs. Through allosteric regulation, it enhances pyruvate kinase activity, favoring increased energy production and RBC survival. The drug is metabolized by several cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. It also acts as a mild-to-moderate inhibitor of CYP19A1 (aromatase), which may have implications for bone density in patients. Mitapivat is a substrate for other enzymes like CYP2B6 and UGT1A1, and the transporter ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1) is involved in its pharmacokinetics. No specific carriers are listed in its profile.

## Pharmacogenetics
Mitapivat’s effectiveness and safety may be influenced by genetic variations in the genes encoding its metabolic enzymes and targets. Variants in PKLR can affect the drug’s efficacy, given its crucial role in the drug’s mechanism of action. Genetic polymorphisms in the CYP450 enzymes, particularly CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2C9, might lead to variability in drug metabolism, impacting both efficacy and toxicity. Patients with genetic alterations that modify enzyme activity could require dose adjustments or experience different clinical outcomes. For instance, the presence of CYP3A4*22, a variant known to reduce enzymatic activity, might reduce mitapivat clearance, necessitating dosage adjustments to avoid adverse effects. Further investigation and more extensive clinical data are required to establish firm pharmacogenetic guidelines.
