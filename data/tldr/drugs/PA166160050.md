## Drug Summary
Alectinib, marketed as Alecensa, is a second-generation oral kinase inhibitor specifically designed to selectively inhibit the activity of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase. It is used predominantly to treat ALK-positive, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The drug operates by targeting cancer cells expressing the ALK-EML4 fusion protein, leading to decreased cell proliferation. Alectinib was granted accelerated approval by regulatory authorities in 2015 for patients who have either progressed on or are intolerant to crizotinib, another ALK inhibitor. Optimal absorption of alectinib occurs about 4 hours post-administration under fed conditions, with food increasing its bioavailability significantly. Metabolism of alectinib predominantly involves CYP3A4, leading to its major active metabolite, M4, which shows similar efficacy against ALK.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary target of alectinib is the ALK tyrosine kinase receptor, which plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ALK-positive NSCLC due to its involvement in cellular signaling pathways that promote cancer cell survival and proliferation. In terms of drug metabolism and transport, alectinib is metabolized primarily by the enzyme CYP3A4. After its initial metabolism, the major active metabolite M4 is also further processed by CYP3A4. Regarding transporters, alectinib interaction involves ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2) and ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), which may influence the drug's absorption and distribution. Notably, alectinib is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein, while M4 is, which might affect their respective pharmacokinetic profiles.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors are crucial in guiding alectinib treatment, particularly concerning variations in the CYP3A4 gene, which is responsible for the metabolism of alectinib to its active form, M4. Patients with altered CYP3A4 activity might experience different levels of drug efficacy and toxicity. Additionally, variations in transporter genes like ABCG2 and ABCB1 could impact the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of alectinib and its metabolites, influencing both therapeutic and adverse effects. Given that these genes encode proteins involved in the drug's excretion and absorption processes, genetic variants could potentially alter drug concentrations in the body, necessitating adjustments in dosing or even influencing the choice of therapeutic options. Although explicit pharmacogenomics data on alectinib were not provided in the provided dataset, these inferences align with general pharmacogenetic principles observed with similar tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
