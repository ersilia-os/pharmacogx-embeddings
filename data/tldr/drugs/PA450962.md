## Drug Summary
Pilocarpine, also known under various brand names such as Diocarpine, Miocarpine, Pilostat, Pilovisc, and Timpilo, is a naturally occurring muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist derived from *Pilocarpus* species. The drug is used primarily for the management of dry mouth (xerostomia) associated with Sjogren's Syndrome or following radiotherapy for head and neck cancers. Additionally, pilocarpine serves an important role in the treatment of ophthalmic conditions like presbyopia and various forms of glaucoma, by reducing elevated intraocular pressure and inducing miosis. Its pharmacokinetics involves rapid absorption with peak plasma concentrations achieved within hours of administration. Metabolism of pilocarpine is less understood but involves CYP2A6-mediated hydroxylation and hydrolysis by paraoxonase 1.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Pilocarpine acts by engaging muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5), with a specific focus on the M3 receptor subtype which is heavily expressed in various exocrine glands and smooth muscle cells, contributing to the contraction of pupillary and iris sphincter muscles. The drug's action on these receptors leads to increased secretion from exocrine glands and contractile effects in smooth muscle. Enzymatically, pilocarpine is metabolized mainly by CYP2A6 and undergoes hydrolysis facilitated by PON1. There was no significant involvement of specific transporters or carriers in its pharmacokinetic profile as per the provided data.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic insights into pilocarpine's action are limited but are potentially significant given the involvement of genetic variations influencing CYP2A6 activity. Variability in CYP2A6, which actively metabolizes pilocarpine, could affect the drug's plasma levels and thereby its therapeutic effectiveness and safety profile. Individuals with different CYP2A6 alleles might experience varied responses to the drug, potentially requiring dose adjustments. However, detailed pharmacogenetic testing and personalized recommendations based on these tips are not routinely employed but could be beneficial in optimizing treatment outcomes for individual patients. Further research might elucidate more concrete associations and potential genetic markers for responsiveness to pilocarpine.
