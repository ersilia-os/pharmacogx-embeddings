## Drug Summary
Oliceridine, marketed under the names Olinvo and Olinvyk, is an opioid analgesic approved by the FDA in 2020 for the management of severe acute pain in adults for which alternative treatments are inadequate. This drug operates as a "biased agonist" at the μ-opioid receptor, preferentially activating the G-protein pathway with minimal recruitment of β-arrestin, which is linked with fewer opioid-related side effects such as respiratory depression and constipation compared to traditional opioids like morphine. Pharmacokinetically, oliceridine demonstrates a rapid onset of analgesic effect within 5 to 20 minutes post-administration and has a short half-life of 1 to 3 hours. It is primarily administered intravenously.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary target of Oliceridine is the μ-opioid receptor (symbol: OPRM1), which it activates to exert analgesic effects through altered ion conductivity in neural cells affecting nociceptive signaling pathways. On the metabolic side, Oliceridine is predominantly metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, with additional minor contributions from CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. This metabolism primarily involves processes such as N-dealkylation, glucuronidation, and dehydrogenation. According to the provided data, there are no active metabolites known, which simplifies the pharmacokinetic profile. There is no mention of specific transporters or carriers associated with Oliceridine.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of Oliceridine involve notable interactions with genetic variants of the metabolizing enzymes, primarily CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Polymorphisms in CYP3A4 and particularly in CYP2D6, which is known for its genetic variability across populations, can significantly influence the pharmacokinetics and thus the efficacy and safety of Oliceridine. For example, individuals with certain variant alleles of CYP2D6 that result in poor metabolizer phenotypes might exhibit prolonged or increased effects of Oliceridine, leading to a higher risk of adverse effects. It is essential in clinical practice to consider these genetic factors when prescribing Oliceridine to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize risks, although specific guidelines or recommendations for genetic testing prior to treatment initiation with Oliceridine have not been detailed in the provided data.
