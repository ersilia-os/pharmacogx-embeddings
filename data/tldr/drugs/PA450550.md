## Drug Summary
Morphine, a potent analgesic derived from opium, was isolated from poppy seeds in 1805 and has been widely employed for the management of moderate to severe chronic pain. Approved by the FDA in 1941, morphine operates predominantly via the opioid receptors, delivering significant pain relief. Its pharmacokinetics reveals a better absorption in alkaline conditions with a high first-pass metabolism, primarily through glucuronidation, demanding higher oral doses relative to parenteral administration to achieve equivalent effects. Morphine's beneficial use in pain management is balanced by a high potential for dependence, tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, and abuse.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Morphine and its principal metabolite, morphine-6-glucuronide, exert effects mainly through mu (OPRM1), kappa (OPRK1), and delta (OPRD1) opioid receptors, which play essential roles in the modulation of pain, reward, and addictive behaviors. Metabolism of morphine is largely mediated by UGT2B7, and to a lesser extent by UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, UGT2B15, UGT2B4, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4, highlighting a complex metabolic pathway that influences both its therapeutic effects and side effects. Transport across cellular barriers is facilitated by ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), and ALB (Serum albumin) acts as a carrier, affecting its distribution and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic variability notably influences morphine efficacy and safety. Genetic variations in OPRM1 (e.g., rs1799971) and ABCB1 (e.g., rs1045642) are associated with differential analgesic responses and adverse effects. For instance, certain alleles of OPRM1 have been correlated with increased analgesic response, which may affect dosage requirements and risk of side effects. Also, variants in ABCB1 could alter the pharmacokinetics by affecting the transport of morphine, potentially leading to variations in drug levels and responses across individuals. These associations underscore the importance of considering genetic makeup in managing therapy and in tailoring pain management strategies.
