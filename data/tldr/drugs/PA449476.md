## Drug Summary
Epirubicin, also known under brand names such as **Epirubicin Ebewe** and **Pharmorubicin**, is an anthracycline chemotherapeutic agent primarily used as a component of adjuvant therapy in breast cancer patients with axillary node tumor involvement after primary tumor resection. Epirubicin acts as an anticancer drug by interfering with DNA synthesis and function, primarily through intercalation between DNA base pairs and inhibition of topoisomerase II, an enzyme critical for DNA replication. This drug is known for its broad-spectrum antitumor ability similar to other anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin and daunorubicin. Epirubicin is recognized for its full absorption profile and undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver and other organs, with multiple metabolites implicated in its action and toxicity, which includes severe effects like bone marrow aplasia and gastrointestinal bleeding.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Epirubicin's mechanism of action primarily involves the inhibition of **DNA topoisomerase 2-alpha (TOP2A)**, which is crucial in DNA replication and transcription processes. By stabilizing the DNA-topoisomerase II complex, epirubicin impedes the ligation-religation actions catalyzed by this enzyme, thereby inhibiting nucleic acid synthesis. Metabolically, epirubicin undergoes reduction, conjugation, and hydrolytic processing involving several enzymes such as **UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B7 (UGT2B7)** and **cytosolic phospholipase A2 (PLA2G4A)**. It is also transported by **multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (ABCC1)**, which may play a role in its distribution and elimination. Notably, there is no information provided on specific carriers involved in epirubicin's mechanism within the system.

## Pharmacogenetics
Although specific pharmacogenetic data for epirubicin was not provided in the DrugBank summary, gene-drug interactions can potentially be inferred based on the enzyme and transporter involvement. Variants within the **UGT2B7** gene could affect the glucuronidation of epirubicin, potentially altering its toxicity and efficacy. Similarly, variations in **ABCC1** which encodes a key efflux transporter, could influence drug resistance and overall treatment outcomes. Since TOP2A is the direct target of epirubicin, genetic differences in this gene might also contribute to variations in response to the drug. Further studies and clinical pharmacogenetic testing may provide deeper insights into these associations and help optimize personalized therapy regimens for cancer patients treated with epirubicin.
