## Drug Summary
Lornoxicam, also known under brand names like Lorcam and Xafon, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the oxicam class, distinguished by its pronounced efficacy in inhibiting prostaglandin biosynthesis. This action renders it effective in managing acute mild to moderate pain and inflammation associated with certain rheumatic diseases. It is particularly noted for its rapid absorption in the gastrointestinal tract (90-100%) and its complete metabolism primarily via CYP2C9, with minimal unchanged drug excreted. Unlike some other NSAIDs, lornoxicam does not lead to increased leukotriene formation, which helps in minimizing adverse events. It is approved for use in Japan and acts by reducing inflammation, pain, fever, and swelling which are typically mediated by prostaglandins.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Lornoxicam acts by inhibiting the activity of cyclooxygenase enzymes, specifically COX-1 (PTGS1) and COX-2 (PTGS2). These enzymes are crucial in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins and thromboxane, compounds that play significant roles in the mediation of inflammation, pain, and fever. The metabolism of lornoxicam is predominantly handled by the enzyme CYP2C9, resulting in its principal metabolite, 5'-hydroxy-lornoxicam, while the unmetabolized drug is negligibly excreted through urine. No specific transporters or carriers are implicated in the pharmacokinetics of lornoxicam as per the provided data.

## Pharmacogenetics
The metabolism of lornoxicam primarily involves the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9. Variants in the CYP2C9 gene can profoundly affect the enzyme's activity, which could potentially alter the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of lornoxicam. For example, individuals with reduced function alleles like CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 may experience altered drug metabolism, leading to higher plasma levels and an increased risk of side effects. There is no additional specific genomic data provided in the context of lornoxicam, but general pharmacogenetic principles suggest careful consideration and potentially adjusted doses in individuals known to have these variants to avoid adverse drug reactions. Such genotype-guided dosing adjustments are still under investigation and are not yet standard clinical practice exclusively for lornoxicam but have been recognized in the context of other medications metabolized by CYP2C9.
