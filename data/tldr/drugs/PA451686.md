## Drug Summary
Ticlopidine, marketed as Ticlid, is an antiplatelet medication primarily used to reduce the risk of thrombotic stroke in patients unable to tolerate aspirin or in those for whom aspirin is ineffective. It acts as a prodrug, metabolized in the liver to produce an active metabolite that inhibits platelet aggregation. This inhibition is primarily achieved through blockade of the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor on platelets, which prevents activation of the glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex, crucial for platelet aggregation and clot formation. Ticlopidine demonstrates a good absorption profile, enhanced by food, and exhibits a significant effect in prolonging bleeding time due to its action on platelet function. Given its serious potential for inducing neutropenia, aplastic anemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura, and agranulocytosis, it carries a black-box warning requiring regular monitoring of white blood cell counts and platelets.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary target of ticlopidine's active metabolite is the P2Y purinoceptor 12 (P2RY12) on platelets, which inhibits ADP-mediated platelet aggregation. The drug is extensively metabolized in the liver by several enzymes, primarily involving cytochrome P450 isoenzymes such as CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP2E1. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is also listed as being involved in its metabolism. No specific transporters or carriers are noted for ticlopidine, indicating that its pharmacokinetics are primarily governed by metabolic transformation rather than specific transport mechanisms.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors significantly influence ticlopidine's efficacy and safety. The variability in CYP2C19 activity, due to genetic polymorphisms, profoundly affects the metabolism of ticlopidine. Individuals with reduced or absent CYP2C19 function (poor metabolizers) might experience higher plasma levels of ticlopidine, leading to an increased risk of adverse effects. Conversely, those with enhanced CYP2C19 activity (ultra-rapid metabolizers) may have reduced drug efficacy. Notably, the FDA emphasizes the consideration of genetic testing for CYP2C19 enzyme activity to guide therapeutic use of ticlopidine, especially in populations with a high prevalence of variants affecting this enzyme's activity. Knowledge of a patientâ€™s CYP2C19 genotype can be crucial in optimizing ticlopidine therapy and mitigating risks of severe side effects and treatment failures.
