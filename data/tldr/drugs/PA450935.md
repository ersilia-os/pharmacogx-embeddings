## Drug Summary
Phenylephrine is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist with multiple applications, including treating hypotension, dilating pupils, and inducing local vasoconstriction. First analyzed in the 1930s, it was approved by the FDA in 1939. Available in several formulations, its indications vary: injectables for shock-related hypotension, ophthalmic for mydriasis and vasoconstriction, intranasal for congestion, and topicals for hemorrhoids. Phenylephrine works by mimicking the action of neurotransmitters, notably by stimulating alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, which leads to increased vascular resistance and blood pressure. It has an oral bioavailability of 38% and undergoes extensive metabolism predominantly via monoamine oxidases and sulfotransferase, resulting in inactive metabolites and has a short half-life in systemic circulation.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The main biochemical targets of Phenylephrine are alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, specifically subtypes ADRA1A, ADRA1B, and ADRA1D. These receptors mediate vasoconstriction and mydriasis, which are central to its therapeutic effects. Phenylephrine is metabolized primarily by enzymes including monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), monoamine oxidase B (MAOB), SULT1A3 (sulfotransferase 1A3 or 1A4), and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2 (Cytochrome P450 1A2). There was no specific transporter or carrier information provided, although this influences absorption and distribution profiles.

## Pharmacogenetics
Phenylephrine's pharmacogenetic profile is centered around its metabolic pathways. Polymorphisms in MAOA and MAOB can influence the rate of phenylephrine metabolism, affecting both efficacy and toxicity. Similarly, variations in SULT1A3 can modify the conjugation and subsequent elimination of phenylephrine, potentially altering drug exposure and response. Although direct pharmacogenomic data were not provided, these enzyme variants could provide a basis for personalized dosing regimens to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects. Further, sensitivity to phenylephrine might also be accentuated in individuals with specific ADRA1 receptor gene variations, underpinning variable responses in blood pressure regulation and vascular tone among patients.
