## Drug Summary
Lopinavir is an antiretroviral drug belonging to the class of protease inhibitors, used primarily in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. It is marketed under various brand names including Aluviran and Koletra, typically in combination with ritonavir, a booster that significantly improves lopinavir's oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profile by inhibiting its metabolism. This combination is necessary due to lopinavir's poor metabolic stability when administered alone. Lopinavir works by inhibiting the activity of HIV-1 protease, an enzyme vital for the viral lifecycle, thus preventing the maturation of the virus and rendering it non-infectious. It exhibits a moderate duration of action, necessitating once or twice daily dosing, and has a complex interaction profile that necessitates careful monitoring when co-administered with other drugs.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Lopinavir specifically targets and inhibits the HIV-1 protease enzyme, a critical component in the viral replication process. Metabolism of lopinavir is predominantly carried out by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP3A43, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7. Co-administration with ritonavir inhibits these CYP enzymes, enhancing lopinavir's plasma concentration. Transport of lopinavir involves several transporters such as P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), and solute carrier organic anion transporters SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3. Lopinavir also interacts with carriers including Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1) and Serum albumin (ALB), affecting its distribution and half-life.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors play a significant role in the variability of responses and interactions seen with lopinavir. Variants in genes encoding the metabolizing enzymes, particularly CYP3A5 and CYP3A4, significantly influence lopinavir's plasma levels and its efficacy. Individuals with certain alleles of these genes may metabolize lopinavir more slowly or rapidly, affecting drug levels and potentially requiring dose adjustment. Additionally, polymorphisms in ABCB1, which encodes for P-glycoprotein, influence transport and bioavailability of lopinavir. Understanding these genetic variations can be essential for optimizing treatment efficacy and minimizing toxicity, providing guidance for personalized antiretroviral therapy regimens.
