## Drug Summary
Pridopidine is an investigational drug that has been primarily researched for the potential treatment of Huntington's Disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. The detailed pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of pridopidine are not well-characterized in publicly available sources like DrugBank. However, it is developed with an aim to modify disease progression by modulating dopaminergic signaling, although the exact mechanism of action remains to be fully elucidated. Safety, efficacy, metabolic pathways, and the absorption profile of pridopidine are areas of active research.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Information on specific molecular targets, enzymes, transporters, or carriers associated with pridopidine is not detailed in the provided DrugBank data and appears to be sparse in scientific literature as well. Given the drug is in the clinical trial phase, such molecular details may still be under investigation or not yet disclosed by the developers.

## Pharmacogenetics
There are no specific pharmacogenetic data provided in the query or available in typical databases such as PharmGKB for pridopidine. As a drug under clinical investigation, pharmacogenomic studies could be forthcoming, particularly those that might explore genetic predictors of treatment response or adverse effects, especially considering the genetic basis of Huntington's Disease. However, as of the last update, no direct pharmacogenetic associations have been confirmed, reflecting a gap in current knowledge and an area potentially ripe for future research.
