## Drug Summary
Sertindole, also known under brand names like Serdolect and SerLect, is an antipsychotic drug used for the treatment of schizophrenia. It belongs to the class of atypical antipsychotics and is known for its efficacy in managing both negative and resistant symptoms of schizophrenia. Sertindole works primarily through its action on various neurotransmitter receptors and has a notable feature of maintaining effectiveness at lower levels of dopamine D2 receptor occupancy, which is often associated with a reduced incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (motor side effects common with many antipsychotics). It is orally available and undergoes hepatic metabolism, primarily involving cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Initially launched in Europe in 1996, it was later withdrawn due to concerns over cardiac safety but has since been reintroduced in certain markets under strict monitoring guidelines.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Sertindole acts on several pharmacological targets including the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2), serotonin receptors (HTR2A, HTR2C, and HTR6), and various subtypes of the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor (ADRA1A, ADRA1B, ADRA1D). It also affects the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2 (KCNH2), which is linked to its cardiac effects. The drug is metabolized primarily by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes of the cytochrome P450 system. No specific transporters or carriers are directly linked with the drug based on the provided database, focusing the metabolic process on liver enzymes.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors are important in the metabolism of Sertindole, as it is significantly processed by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes. Variations in genes encoding these enzymes can affect the drug's metabolism, efficacy, and safety. For instance, individuals with certain polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 gene, which can lead to poor, intermediate, extensive, or ultrarapid metabolizing phenotypes, may experience different levels of drug exposure, potentially impacting the therapeutic outcome and risk of adverse effects. No specific genomic data was provided in the database for Sertindole; however, considering pharmacogenetics is crucial in ensuring effective and safe treatment outcomes for patients, especially in managing drug dosage and anticipating possible adverse effects linked to genetic variations.
