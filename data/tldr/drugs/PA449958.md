## Drug Summary
Ibutilide is a Class III antiarrhythmic drug used intravenously for the rapid conversion of both atrial flutter and recent onset atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm. As with other class III antiarrhythmics, Ibutilide works by prolonging the duration of the action potential and increasing refractoriness in the atrial and ventricular tissues. Its distinct mechanism involves the induction of a persistent inward sodium current and the potent inhibition of rapid delayed rectifier potassium currents, primarily through interactions with various ion channels. The drug is absorbed rapidly following intravenous administration, and its metabolism is predominantly hepatic, leading to various metabolites, some retaining similar pharmacological properties to the parent compound.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Ibutilide acts on multiple ion channel targets including the Voltage-dependent L-type calcium channel subunits CACNA1C, CACNB1, and CACNA2D1, indicating its influence on calcium influx, which contributes to its antiarrhythmic effects. Additionally, Ibutilide interacts with the potassium channels such as KCNH2, KCNK1, KCNK6, KCNH6, and KCNH7, and the ATP-sensitive inward rectifier potassium channel KCNJ11. These interactions mainly lead to the inhibition of potassium efflux, pivotal in prolonging the action potential. There are no significant interactions with enzymes, transporters, or carriers recorded for Ibutilide, which simplifies its pharmacokinetic profile in terms of drug-drug interactions.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic insights into Ibutilide treatment are currently limited but potentially significant concerning its safety and efficacy. Variability in genes encoding its targets like KCNH2, which forms part of the hERG potassium channel critical for cardiac repolarization, could influence patient response and risk of drug-induced arrhythmias. No specific genetic markers are currently used clinically to guide Ibutilide therapy, but patients experiencing atypical responses or adverse effects might benefit from pharmacogenetic testing centered on these ion channel genes. Further research could uncover more about genetic variants that modify drug action, which would be valuable for optimizing individual responses to treatment and minimizing side effects.
