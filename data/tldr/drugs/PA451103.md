## Drug Summary
Primaquine, also known as Neo-Quipenyl and Primachin, is an aminoquinoline antimalarial agent used specifically for the radical cure of *Plasmodium vivax* and *P. ovale* malarial infections, helping to prevent relapses following treatment with a blood schizontocide. It is notable for killing the intrahepatic form of these parasites, thereby preventing the development of erythrocytic forms that can cause relapses. Additionally, Primaquine possesses gametocytocidal activity against all plasmodia, including *P. falciparum*, which is crucial for preventing the transmission of malaria. The drug is always used in conjunction with other blood schizonticides as it does not effectively kill the asexual blood forms of the parasite. While the exact mechanism remains partly unclear, it is suggested that Primaquine may act by generating reactive oxygen species or interfering with electron transport in the parasite.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Primaquine interacts with several molecular targets. Identified targets include Keratin, type II cytoskeletal 7 (KRT7) and Ribosyldihydronicotinamide dehydrogenase [quinone] (NQO2) although the clinical significance of these interactions is not well established. The metabolism of Primaquine is facilitated by multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP1A1, and CYP1B1. These enzymes are critical for the hepatic processing and elimination of the drug. Additionally, Primaquine is a substrate for the transporter protein P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), which may affect its distribution and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetics plays a significant role in the administration and efficacy of Primaquine, especially due to its potential to cause hemolytic anemia in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. This genetic condition predominantly affects how red blood cells handle oxidative stress, leading to an increased risk of hemolysis when exposed to certain oxidative drugs like Primaquine. Variations in the activity of metabolic enzymes such as CYP2D6 also impact the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of the drug, affecting drug levels and response. CYP2D6 polymorphisms, which vary widely among populations, can lead to differing rates of metabolism of Primaquine, potentially modulating its therapeutic efficacy and risk of adverse effects. Thus, genetic testing for G6PD deficiency and considerations of CYP2D6 variants may be crucial in the safe and effective use of Primaquine.
