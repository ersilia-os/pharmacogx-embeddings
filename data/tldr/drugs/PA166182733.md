## Drug Summary
Larotrectinib sulfate, marketed under the brand name Vitrakvi, is a selective oral inhibitor of tropomyosin receptor kinases (TRK), a class of enzymes implicated in neural development and function. It has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of solid tumors that express an NTRK gene fusion, without a known acquired resistance mutation, regardless of the tumor's original location in the body. As a highly selective TRK inhibitor, larotrectinib targets the abnormal proteins resulting from NTRK gene fusions, leading to anti-tumor activity across various types of cancer, including lung, thyroid, melanoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and various sarcomas. The drug is generally well-tolerated, with most adverse events being grade 1 or 2, and has a bioavailability of about 70%.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Larotrectinib specifically targets and inhibits the proteins produced by fusion genes involving the NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 genes, which encode for the TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC neurotrophin receptors, respectively. These receptor tyrosine kinases are typically involved in neurological development and function but can contribute to cancer progression when altered by gene fusions. The inhibition of TRK fusion proteins by larotrectinib disrupts oncogenic signaling pathways, leading to decreased tumor growth and potential cancer cell death. Detailed information on specific enzymes, transporters, and carriers that interact with larotrectinib is limited, owing primarily to the focused mechanism of action of the drug targeting the TRK fusion proteins.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of larotrectinib centers primarily on the presence of NTRK gene fusions in tumors, which are predictive biomarkers for the therapeutic efficacy of the drug. These gene fusions result in the constitutive activation of TRK signaling, leading to uncontrolled cellular proliferation and survival. Tumor genotyping to confirm the presence of NTRK fusions is crucial before therapy initiation, as these genetic alterations are the sole targets of the drug. The effectiveness and safety of larotrectinib may vary based on the specific fusion variant and its biological consequences in different tumor types. Additionally, genetic variations in drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters might influence larotrectinib pharmacokinetics and patient response, although specific genes and variants have not been thoroughly identified or characterized in the context of larotrectinib treatment.
