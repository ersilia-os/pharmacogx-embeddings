## Drug Summary
Dexpramipexole is an investigational drug, identified under the DrugBank identifier DB15130 and PharmGKB ID PA164742949. The drug has been examined in clinical trials, such as NCT01511029, which aimed to study its effects on QTc interval in healthy volunteers. The QTc interval represents the duration of ventricular depolarization and repolarization on an electrocardiogram (ECG) and is crucial for assessing potential cardiac side effects of drugs. Currently, dexpramipexole has no officially approved indication for clinical use and lacks comprehensive data on its pharmacodynamics and mechanism of action. Likewise, information on its absorption, metabolism, and toxicity is not thoroughly outlined in available resources.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
According to the provided DrugBank information, specific targets, enzymes, transporters, or carriers associated with dexpramipexole have not been detailed. This absence of information suggests that detailed biochemical interactions or the precise molecular mechanism through which dexpramipexole may exert potential therapeutic effects are still under investigation or have not been published extensively.

## Pharmacogenetics
As per the available DrugBank data, there are no genomic or pharmacogenetic data explicitly linked to dexpramipexole. Thus, any direct associations between genetic variations and the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of dexpramipexole cannot be presently confirmed. As research progresses, future studies might provide insights into pharmacogenetic factors that could influence the efficacy or safety profile of dexpramipexole, which would be crucial for personalized medicine approaches in its potential future applications.
