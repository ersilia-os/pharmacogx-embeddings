## Drug Summary
Apomorphine, also marketed as Ixense, Spontane, and Uprima, is a non-ergoline synthetic derivative primarily used as a dopaminergic agonist for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It specifically acts to treat hypomobility and "off" episodes in advanced stages of the disease. First synthesized in 1845 and later utilized in clinical practice from 1884, Apomorphine's mechanism of action involves stimulating dopamine D2, D3, and D5 receptors, which are crucial in controlling motor functions. It is known for its rapid onset of action, with a plasma and cerebrospinal fluid T_max of 10-20 minutes, but exhibits significant pharmacokinetic variability among individuals. Metabolism largely occurs through N-demethylation by CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5, as well as conjugation by various UGT and SULT enzymes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Apomorphine interacts with multiple dopamine receptors including D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5, which are associated with its effects on motor control and possibly non-motor symptoms. It also has affinity for several adrenergic and serotonin receptors such as ADRA2A, ADRA2B, ADRA2C, HTR1A, HTR1B, HTR1D, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C. These interactions might contribute to varied clinical effects and side effects. The metabolism involves cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5, and conjugation by UGTs (UGT1A1, UGT1A3, and others) and SULTs (SULT1A1, SULT1A2, etc.). Apomorphine's transport through neuronal and systemic circuits is facilitated by the synaptic vesicular amine transporter SLC18A2 and it binds to serum albumin (ALB) which could affect its distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors significantly impact apomorphine's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, although specific guidelines for genotype-based dosing are currently not well-established. Polymorphisms in CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 could lead to variations in drug metabolism, resulting in differences in efficacy and toxicity among individuals. Similarly, variations in UGT and SULT enzymes involved in its conjugation could influence the disposition of the drug. Variability in dopamine and serotonin receptor genes might also influence the therapeutic response and side-effect profile of apomorphine. Given these considerations, personalized medicine approaches could potentially enhance the effectiveness and minimize the adverse effects of apomorphine therapy in Parkinson's disease management, but more research is needed to develop precise pharmacogenetic protocols.
