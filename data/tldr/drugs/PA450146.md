## Drug Summary
Levoketoconazole, marketed as RECORLEV by Xeris Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is an enantiomer of ketoconazole specifically used for its potent inhibitory action on steroidogenic enzymes. Approved by the FDA on December 30, 2021, it is prescribed for the treatment of endogenous hypercortisolemia in adult patients with Cushing's syndrome when surgery is not a viable option or has failed. The drug works by reducing the levels of cortisol, a key factor in mitigating the morbidity and mortality associated with hypercortisolism. It has been shown to cause side effects such as hypocortisolism, QT interval prolongation, and sensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Levoketoconazole primarily targets several critical steroidogenic enzymes including CYP17A1 (Steroid 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase), CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 (mitochondrial enzymes responsible for cortisol synthesis), and CYP11A1 (cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme). It also affects CYP51A1 involved in sterol synthesis. The drug is metabolized in the liver, primarily involving CYP3A4, and also interacts with a range of cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP1A2, CYP3A5, CYP7A1, CYP19A1, and CYP21A2. Transporters such as ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), SLC47A1 (Multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1), and SLC22A2 (solute carrier family 22 member 2) are also engaged in its pharmacokinetic profile. No specific carriers are mentioned for this drug.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacology of levoketoconazole is heavily influenced by its interactions with various cytochrome P450 enzymes, which exhibit considerable genetic variability. CYP3A5 and CYP2C8 polymorphisms, in particular, can potentially alter the drug's effectiveness and safety profile due to variations in metabolism rates. Patients with genetic variants that reduce the activity of these enzymes might experience higher drug exposure leading to enhanced therapeutic effects along with a potentially elevated risk of adverse effects. Although no specific pharmacogenomic guidance is provided in available resources, the complex interactions with multiple CYP enzymes suggest a potential for significant pharmacogenetic impacts. Further research could provide deeper insights into how genetic variants of these enzymes affect therapy with levoketoconazole.
