## Drug Summary
Ascorbic acid, also known by brand names such as Ascoltin and Ascorbicap, is a water-soluble vitamin commonly referred to as vitamin C. It is essential for the human diet, critical for maintaining connective tissue and bone health due to its role in collagen synthesis. Vitamin C functions as a cofactor in the hydroxylation of proline residues in collagen, which is essential for its stabilization and proper function. This vitamin is also a potent antioxidant, protecting the body against oxidative stress. Ascorbic acid is utilized in the prevention and treatment of scurvy, a disease resulting from vitamin C deficiency characterized by defective connective tissues. Itâ€™s also used for its general antioxidant properties and has applications in wound and bone healing, urine acidification, and potentially as an antiviral agent. Vitamin C is absorbed via the gastrointestinal tract with an absorption rate of 70% to 90%, and its metabolism primarily occurs in the liver through reversible oxidation to dehydroascorbic acid.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Ascorbic acid influences several biological targets linked to its role in hydroxylation reactions critical for the synthesis of collagen and other vital molecules. Key enzymatic targets include Procollagen-lysine,2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenases (PLOD1, PLOD2, PLOD3), which are crucial for collagen maturation, and various prolyl hydroxylases like P4HA1 and EGLN1-3 that help regulate hypoxia-inducible factors. Ascorbic acid is also involved with the activity of dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and peptidyl-glycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), influencing neurotransmitter metabolism and peptide modification, respectively. Regarding transport, ascorbic acid uptake is mediated by solute carriers like SLC23A1 and SLC23A2, and it interacts with glucose transporters such as SLC2A1 to SLC2A4. It is also carried in the bloodstream by serum albumin (ALB). The enzyme Thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1) is also associated with ascorbic acid, involved in its redox cycling and linked to its antioxidative properties.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic aspects of ascorbic acid primarily relate to the genetic variability in its transport and metabolism. Polymorphisms in genes encoding the vitamin C transporters, such as SLC23A1 and SLC23A2, could influence individual variability in the absorption and cellular uptake of ascorbic acid, potentially impacting its therapeutic efficacy and antioxidant properties. Variations in these genes may affect the bioavailability of vitamin C and predispose individuals to differences in scurvy risk or response to supplementation. Although comprehensive pharmacogenetic data specific to ascorbic acid are limited, these variations hint at the importance of genetics in individual responses to vitamin C supplementation and therapy. Such genetic associations could guide personalized nutritional and therapeutic approaches for disorders related to oxidative stress and collagen synthesis.
