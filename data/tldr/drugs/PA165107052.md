## Drug Summary
Rupatadine is a dual antagonist of histamine H1 and platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptors, utilized for its antiallergic properties. It is indicated for the symptomatic relief of both seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, as well as chronic spontaneous urticaria. Rupatadine, known commercially as Rupall, is available in tablet form for adults and a liquid formulation for pediatric use. The drug's mechanism involves inhibiting actions that cause allergic symptoms such as nasal blockage, rhinorrhea, itching, and swelling by blocking the effects of histamine at H1 receptors and PAF at PAF receptors, both of which are released during allergic responses. Rupatadine shows rapid absorption, achieving peak concentrations in approximately one hour post-administration, but this can be delayed when taken with a high-fat meal.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Rupatadine targets two main receptors: the Histamine H1 receptor (HRH1) and the Platelet-activating factor receptor (PTAFR), mitigating the effects of histamine and PAF which are largely responsible for symptoms of allergic responses. The metabolism of rupatadine primarily involves oxidation processes mediated by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4, with lesser contributions from CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. The metabolites produced, notably desloratadine and its hydroxylated forms, retain partial activity as H1 receptor antagonists. Rupatadine has no specific transporters or carriers associated with its pharmacokinetic profile.

## Pharmacogenetics
While the pharmacogenetic data specific to rupatadine are not extensively detailed, the involvement of multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes in its metabolism suggests potential variability in its pharmacokinetics based on genetic polymorphisms in these enzymes. Variants within CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 may influence the drug's metabolism, affecting both its efficacy and the risk of adverse effects. For instance, individuals with certain CYP2D6 polymorphisms may metabolize rupatadine differently, potentially requiring adjustments in dosage. Further pharmacogenetic studies could provide more personalized guidance on the use of rupatadine based on individual genetic profiles.
