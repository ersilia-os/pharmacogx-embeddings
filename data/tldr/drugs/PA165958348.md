## Drug Summary
Indacaterol, marketed under names such as Arcapta, Hirobriz, Onbrez, and Onbrize, is an ultra-long-acting β(2)-adrenoceptor agonist developed for once-daily management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Approved by the FDA and EMA, it is specifically indicated for the maintenance of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD. This chiral molecule is dispensed as the R-enantiomer and has a rapid onset of action, taking effect within minutes and lasting approximately 24 hours. Indacaterol mainly acts as a bronchodilator, achieving its effects by relaxing the smooth muscles of the airways to improve breathing. The drug’s absorption is fairly rapid with peak serum concentrations occurring around 15 minutes post-inhalation, and it has a bioavailability of about 43-45% after inhaled doses.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Indacaterol exerts its therapeutic effects primarily through stimulation of the Beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2). The drug has a high selectivity for β2 over β1 and β3 receptors, which contributes to its efficacy as a bronchodilator. Metabolically, it is processed by CYP3A4, which is responsible for the hydroxylation of Indacaterol, and UGT1A1, which metabolizes it into the phenolic O-glucuronide. Additionally, indacaterol's pharmacokinetics are influenced by P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), a transporter that plays a role in the drug's distribution and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of Indacaterol involves interactions with enzymes such as CYP3A4 and UGT1A1, both involved in its metabolism. Variability in genes encoding these enzymes can impact the drug’s metabolism, potentially affecting both the efficacy and safety of the medication. For instance, polymorphisms in CYP3A4 could alter the rate of Indacaterol hydroxylation, leading to variations in drug levels and response among individuals. Similarly, variations in UGT1A1 might modify the glucuronidation process, influencing drug clearance. While specific pharmacogenomic data for indacaterol is not widely reported, these enzymatic pathways suggest possible areas where genetic variability could be significant. Patients with variations in these genes might require adjustments in dosing or experience different adverse effects, although clinical data supporting specific guidelines for these potential variations are not robust at this time.
