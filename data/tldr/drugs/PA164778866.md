## Drug Summary
Liothyronine, also known by its brand name Tertroxin, is a synthetic form of the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3). It is primarily used for replacement therapy in various forms of hypothyroidism, including primary (thyroidal), secondary (pituitary), and tertiary (hypothalamic) hypothyroidism, whether congenital or acquired. Additionally, it is utilized as an adjunct therapy to surgery and radioiodine treatment in the management of thyroid cancer and as a diagnostic agent in suppression tests to diagnose mild hyperthyroidism or thyroid gland autonomy. Liothyronine is more potent and acts faster than levothyroxine, though its duration of effect is shorter. The drug is well absorbed orally, and its pharmacodynamics involve the binding to thyroid hormone receptors, thereby controlling DNA transcription and protein synthesis, which influence various physiological aspects including metabolism, growth, and neurological development.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Liothyronine acts by binding to thyroid hormone receptors (THRA and THRB), influencing gene expression that regulates development, metabolism, and growth. Apart from its targets, liothyronine is metabolized in the liver primarily by deiodination through enzymes such as UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-1 (UGT1A1). Transporters involved with liothyronine include a variety of solute carrier family members (SLCO1A2, SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, SLCO4C1, SLCO1C1, SLCO4A1), sodium/bile acid cotransporter (SLC10A1), the organic anion transporter (SLC22A8), monocarboxylate transporter 10 (SLC16A10), the P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), and the amino acid transporter SLC7A5. Liothyronine is also carried by transthyretin (TTR), thyroxine-binding globulin (SERPINA7), and serum albumin (ALB).

## Pharmacogenetics
Studies have shown part of the inter-individual variability in the response to liothyronine could be attributed to genetic differences in the enzymes, transporters, and carriers associated with its metabolism and transport. Specific alleles within genes such as UGT1A1 might impact the drug's metabolism, affecting its pharmacokinetics and dynamics. Genetic variations in thyroid hormone receptors (THRA and THRB) may also modify individual responses, impacting therapeutic efficacy and risk of adverse effects. Although no direct pharmacogenomic data is currently highlighted, the potential for variations in genes such as SLCO1A2 and SLCO1B1, which are involved in its transport, suggests the likely relevance of pharmacogenetics in individualizing liothyronine therapy. Further associative studies could illuminate these interactions, potentially guiding more personalized approaches to dosing and therapy management based on genetic profiles.
