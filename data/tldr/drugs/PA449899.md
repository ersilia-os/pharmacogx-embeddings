## Drug Summary
Hydrochlorothiazide, known under various brand names such as Dichlotride, Esidrex, and HydroDIURIL, is the most commonly prescribed thiazide diuretic. Approved by the FDA in 1959, it is used primarily to manage edema and hypertension, either alone or in combination with other drugs such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Hydrochlorothiazide operates by promoting the excretion of sodium and water, affecting the distal convoluted tubule of the kidneys. This diuretic demonstrates a bioavailability of 65-75% with peak serum levels (C<sub>max</sub>) reached within 1-5 hours after oral dosing. Importantly, it is not metabolized by the body and is excreted unchanged, which simplifies its pharmacokinetic profile.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary pharmacological target of hydrochlorothiazide is the sodium-chloride symporter SLC12A3, located in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney, where it inhibits sodium and chloride reabsorption, leading to increased diuresis. Additionally, hydrochlorothiazide affects the calcium-activated potassium channel subunit alpha-1 (KCNMA1), which may contribute to its diuretic and blood pressure-lowering effects. Regarding transport, hydrochlorothiazide is absorbed into renal epithelial cells via organic anion transporters such as SLC22A6 (OAT1), SLC22A8 (OAT3), and SLC22A11 (OAT4). It is then secreted into the tubular lumen by the multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (ABCC4 or MRP4). Albumin (ALB) is also identified as a carrier for the drug, which may affect its distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors influencing the response to hydrochlorothiazide are not significantly detailed in the available data, but given its mechanism of action through SLC12A3, genetic variations in this transporter could potentially affect the drugâ€™s efficacy and safety. For example, certain alleles in related sodium and chloride transporters could modify patient responses to hydrochlorothiazide, resulting in different levels of diuresis or risk of electrolyte imbalance. Further research could better establish these associations, improving personalized medication strategies. Currently, no extensive genome-wide association studies or specific gene-drug interaction guidelines for hydrochlorothiazide have been confirmed. As such, general population dosing guidelines are primarily followed until more specific pharmacogenetic data becomes available.
