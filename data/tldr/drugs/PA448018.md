## Drug Summary
Acetazolamide, sold under many brand names such as Diamox and Edemox, is a diuretic and anticonvulsant medication. It belongs to the class of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. It is primarily used to treat edema due to congestive heart failure, drug-induced edema, chronic simple (open-angle) glaucoma, and certain types of seizures including centrencephalic epilepsies. The drug's effectiveness against seizures is particularly noted in women whose seizures coincide with specific phases of the menstrual cycle, although its efficacy can diminish over time due to the development of tolerance. The mechanism of action involves the inhibition of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which leads to a decrease in fluid secretion and promotes diuresis by reducing reabsorption of bicarbonate in the kidneys. This process results in alkaline urine and increased excretion of bicarbonate, sodium, potassium, and water.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Acetazolamide directly inhibits several isoforms of the carbonic anhydrase enzyme, including CA1, CA2, CA3, CA4, CA7, CA12, and CA14, which are mainly found in the kidneys, eyes, and nervous system. This inhibition results in various therapeutic effects like reduced intraocular pressure in glaucoma and decreased fluid retention in edema. Acetazolamide also has an influence on Aquaporin-1 (AQP1), a water channel protein, which could contribute to its diuretic effect. The drug is metabolized primarily by Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), and it is a substrate for SLC22A6, a solute carrier protein that affects renal secretion. No specific carrier proteins involved in its action have been identified from the provided data.

## Pharmacogenetics
While specific pharmacogenetic data related to acetazolamide were not provided in the DrugBank entry nor indicated in available genomic data, general pharmacogenetic interactions can be inferred. Given that CYP3A4 is involved in the drug's metabolism, genetic variants in the CYP3A4 gene could potentially affect the pharmacokinetics of acetazolamide, altering drug levels and thus its efficacy and toxicity. Similarly, variations in the solute carrier SLC22A6 might influence the drug's renal clearance. Additional research and clinical genetic testing could be valuable to further elucidate these pharmacogenetic associations and to optimize individual therapy with acetazolamide, considering the potential variability in response due to genetic factors.
