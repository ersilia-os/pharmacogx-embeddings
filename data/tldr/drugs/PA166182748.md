## Drug Summary
Lusutrombopag is a thrombopoietin receptor (TPOR) agonist developed by Shionogi & Company. It received its first global approval in Japan in 2015 and by the FDA in 2018 under the brand name Mulpleta. Lusutrombopag is designed for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adults with chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo a medical or dental procedure. Thrombocytopenia, a condition characterized by abnormally low platelet counts, poses risks during invasive procedures due to increased bleeding susceptibility. Lusutrombopag acts by mimicking endogenous thrombopoietin, promoting megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation into platelets. It is orally bioavailable, with pharmacokinetics showing rapid absorption and dose-proportional increases in platelet counts. With a mean time to peak effects spanning several days, its utility lies in pre-procedural medical management.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Lusutrombopag primarily targets the thrombopoietin receptor (TPOR), also known as MPL, expressed on megakaryocytes. Activation of this receptor stimulates pathways crucial for platelet production from bone marrow progenitor cells. The drug's metabolism is primarily facilitated by the enzyme CYP4A11, which involves processes like oxidation and glucuronidation. Additionally, it interacts with transport mechanisms involving proteins such as ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1) and ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2), which may influence its distribution and elimination. No specific carriers are identified for this drug, indicating a straightforward pharmacokinetic profile primarily driven by enzymatic activity and membrane transport.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of lusutrombopag involves interactions with specific enzymes and transporters that can vary among individuals due to genetic differences. The primary enzyme involved, CYP4A11, is part of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system known for its genetic variability which can affect drug metabolism rates and efficacy. Variants in CYP4A11 could potentially influence the pharmacokinetics of lusutrombopag, although specific associations have not been robustly characterized in the literature. Similarly, genetic variations in the transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2 could affect drug absorption and excretion, potentially altering effectiveness or risk of adverse effects. This necessitates further studies to elucidate detailed pharmacogenetic impacts and could inform personalized dosing guidelines in the future.
