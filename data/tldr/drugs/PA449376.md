## Drug Summary
Disulfiram is a carbamate derivative primarily used to support the treatment and management of chronic alcoholism by acting as an alcohol deterrent. Known under various brand names like Antabus and Anticol, it modifies the body's metabolism of alcohol, leading to increased levels of acetaldehyde when alcohol is consumed. This causes acetaldehyde syndrome, which includes symptoms such as flushing, nausea, hypotension, and respiratory difficulties, thereby deterring the intake of alcohol. Disulfiram is absorbed slowly from the gastrointestinal tract, with hepatic metabolism and no indication that it influences the rate of alcohol elimination from the body. Its pharmacodynamics involves inducing sensitivity to alcohol leading to unpleasant symptoms proportional to the dosage of both disulfiram and alcohol.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Disulfiram acts by irreversibly inactivating aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2), an enzyme crucial in the second step of ethanol metabolism, leading to the accumulation of acetaldehyde when alcohol is consumed. This blockage prevents the normal conversion of acetaldehyde into acetic acid, substantially elevating the acetaldehyde levels in the blood, which contributes to the symptomatic reactions of acetaldehyde syndrome. In addition to ALDH2, disulfiram targets dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), affecting dopamine metabolism. The drug is metabolized predominantly by hepatic enzymes, including CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2E1, which are involved in the oxidative metabolism of many substances. It also interacts with the bile salt export pump (ABCB11), a transporter that could influence disulfiram's biotransformation or disposition.

## Pharmacogenetics
In pharmacogenetic contexts, genetic variations particularly in the ALDH2 and CYP enzymes could potentially influence the effectiveness and tolerability of disulfiram. Variants in ALDH2, which are common in East Asian populations, lead to decreased enzyme activity, potentially exaggerating disulfiram-alcohol reactions. Furthermore, polymorphisms in genes encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2E1 could alter the metabolic rate of disulfiram, affecting both efficacy and toxicity profiles. Individuals with different genetic alleles of these enzymes may exhibit varied responses to disulfiram, impacting both its therapeutic outcomes and side-effect profile. There is, however, a need for more comprehensive genomic data and clinical trials to better establish these pharmacogenetic associations and guide personalized treatment approaches with disulfiram.
