## Drug Summary
Cariprazine is an atypical antipsychotic used primarily for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and for managing acute episodes of mania and depression associated with bipolar I disorder. Developed as a piperazine derivative, it functions pharmacologically as a partial agonist at the dopamine D2 and D3 receptors, and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors, while antagonizing serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. This receptor profile contributes both to efficacy in reducing both positive and negative symptomatology in schizophrenia and in managing bipolar disorder symptoms. Cariprazine's most clinically relevant systemic concentration depends on both the parent drug and its active metabolites, desmethyl cariprazine and didesmethyl cariprazine. It generally reaches peak plasma concentration within 3 to 6 hours post-administration, with food intake showing minimal influence on its absorption.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Cariprazine's therapeutic effects are largely mediated through its binding to multiple neurotransmitter receptors: it acts as a partial agonist at dopamine D2 (DRD2) and D3 (DRD3) receptors, and serotonin 5-HT1A (HTR1A) receptors, antagonizes 5-HT2A (HTR2A), 5-HT2B (HTR2B), 5-HT2C (HTR2C) receptors, and also has an affinity for histamine H1 (HRH1) and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, including ADRA1A. Cariprazine is extensively metabolized primarily by CYP3A4, with additional involvement from CYP2D6. Metabolites formed still exhibit pharmacological activity and CYP3A5, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 also participate in its metabolism. P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1) is indicated as a transporter involved in cariprazine's pharmacokinetics but no carriers have been specified.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of cariprazine are influenced by genetic variations in enzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Variants in these genes can alter the metabolism of cariprazine, affecting both drug effectiveness and patientâ€™s response. For example, CYP2D6 polymorphisms can lead to variable enzymatic activity ranging from poor to ultra-rapid metabolism, potentially impacting the drug's efficacy and safety profile. Additionally, genetic variants in pharmacodynamic targets such as the dopamine and serotonin receptors could influence individual responses to the drug, although detailed pharmacogenetic data linking specific receptor gene variants to clinical outcomes with cariprazine are currently limited. Further research could help clarify these associations and lead to more personalized approaches in managing psychiatric conditions.
