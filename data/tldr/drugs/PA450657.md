## Drug Summary
Nortriptyline, marketed under various brand names such as Allegron, Ateben, Avantyl, Noritren, and others, is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) primarily used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD). It operates by inhibiting the reuptake of neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine, enhancing their availability in the central nervous system. Nortriptyline also shows affinity for several other receptor types including muscarinic acetylcholine, histamine, and various serotonin receptors, contributing to both its therapeutic effects and side-effect profile. The drug is well absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, but its bioavailability can vary considerably due to extensive first-pass metabolism, achieved largely in the liver. The primary metabolic pathways involve demethylation and hydroxylation followed by conjugation.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Nortriptyline interacts with a number of molecular targets including neurotransmitter transporters such as SLC6A2 (sodium-dependent noradrenaline transporter) and SLC6A4 (serotonin transporter). It also binds to various receptors including HTR2A, HTR1A, HRH1, and multiple adrenergic receptors (ADRA1A, ADRA1D, ADRA1B, ADRA2A, ADRA2B, ADRA2C, ADRB1, ADRB2, ADRB3). These interactions contribute to its antidepressant, antimuscarinic, and sedative properties. Metabolically, nortriptyline is processed predominantly by CYP2D6, with contributions from CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. Transport-wise, it is carried by SLC6A2 and ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), while albumin (ALB) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (ORM1) serve as its carriers.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic aspects of nortriptyline are notably influenced by genetic polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 enzyme, crucial for its metabolism. Variants like rs3892097, rs35742686, rs5030655, rs1135824, and rs28371733 in CYP2D6 can lead to reduced or poor metabolism of nortriptyline, impacting drug plasma levels and, consequently, efficacy and toxicity. Patients with these genetic variants require dose adjustments or alternative treatments due to the risk of adverse effects or reduced therapeutic effectiveness. The variability in CYP2D6 activity owing to genetic differences is a critical consideration in personalizing treatment plans for individuals prescribed nortriptyline.
