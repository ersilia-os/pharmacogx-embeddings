## Drug Summary
Tiotropium is a long-acting antimuscarinic agent widely used in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. It acts primarily on the muscarinic M3 receptors in the airways, leading to smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation, thereby improving airflow and reducing respiratory symptoms. Tiotropium is administered via inhalation, which allows for targeted action in the lungs with minimal systemic exposure. Pharmacokinetically, about 19.5% to 33% of inhaled tiotropium is bioavailable, and it reaches peak plasma concentrations in about 5-7 minutes. Its effects on bronchodilation are sustained for over 24 hours, making it suitable for once-daily dosing. Tiotropium has a low rate of metabolism with around 74% being excreted unchanged in the urine.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Tiotropium specifically antagonizes several subtypes of muscarinic receptors (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5), but its therapeutic bronchodilatory effects are chiefly mediated through inhibition of the M3 receptors located on smooth muscle cells in the airways. Though its metabolism is minimal, it is reported to involve non-enzymatic cleavage and some involvement of cytochrome P450 enzymes, notably CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Among the transporters, it interacts with solute carrier family members SLC22A5 and SLC22A4, which may play a role in its renal clearance or tissue distribution. No specific carriers are directly associated with tiotropium.

## Pharmacogenetics
While specific pharmacogenetic data for tiotropium are limited, the potential involvement of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in its metabolism suggests possible variability in drug response or toxicity related to genetic variants in these enzymes. Variants in these CYP enzymes are known to cause differences in enzyme activity, which could affect the drug's breakdown, although this drug is primarily excreted unchanged. More importantly, considering that muscarinic receptors are the primary drug targets, genetic variations in these receptor genes (e.g., CHRM3) might also influence individual responses to tiotropium. Future pharmacogenetic studies could provide more insights into the impact of genetic variations on the efficacy and safety of tiotropium, particularly in populations with differential genetic backgrounds affecting receptor function or expression.
