## Drug Summary
Naltrexone is a synthetic opioid antagonist, primarily used in the treatment of alcohol and opioid dependence. It is commercially available under various brand names including Naltrexone, Vivitrex, and Depade. The drug works by blocking the effects of opioids via competitive binding at opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), which includes mu, kappa, and delta receptors. It has minimal agonist activity and is effective when administered orally. Naltrexone has higher bioavailability orally but undergoes significant first-pass metabolism in the liver, primarily metabolized into 6-beta-naltrexol, which contributes to its therapeutic effects. The drugâ€™s action in alcohol dependence is less understood but may involve modulation of the endogenous opioid system.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Naltrexone acts as a competitive antagonist at several opioid receptors: OPRM1 (Mu-type), OPRK1 (Kappa-type), and OPRD1 (Delta-type). These receptors are involved in the drug's primary mechanism to counteract the subjective and addictive effects of opioids and potentially alcohol. Naltrexone also targets SIGMAR1, a sigma non-opioid intracellular receptor, which might play a role in its pharmacodynamics. The major metabolic pathway of naltrexone involves the enzyme UGT1A1 (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-1), critical for its transformation into active metabolites. There are no significant interactions reported with major transporters or carriers.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic aspects of naltrexone treatment have shown that genetic variations can influence treatment efficacy, particularly in managing alcohol dependence. One significant genetic marker is the SNP rs1799971 in the OPRM1 gene, which encodes the mu-type opioid receptor. Patients carrying specific alleles of this SNP may experience different outcomes when treated with naltrexone for alcohol addiction, including a variation in the number of abstinent days. This indicates that the genetic makeup of the mu-opioid receptor can significantly affect the therapeutic response to naltrexone, highlighting the importance of personalized medicine approaches in the treatment of addiction.
