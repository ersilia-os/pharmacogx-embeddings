## Drug Summary
Prochlorperazine, marketed under several brand names such as Buccastem, Emetiral, Stemzine, and Volimin, is a piperazine phenothiazine derivative and a first-generation antipsychotic agent. It is primarily used for the symptomatic treatment of severe nausea and vomiting, as well as for the short-term management of psychotic disorders including schizophrenia and generalized non-psychotic anxiety. Additionally, it finds off-label use in managing adult and pediatric migraines. The onset of its pharmacological action varies between 10 to 40 minutes, depending on the route of administration, with an oral bioavailability of approximately 12.5%. Prochlorperazine exerts its effects mainly through the depression of the chemoreceptor trigger zone and blockade of D2 dopamine receptors in the brain but also shows activity against other neurotransmitter systems including histaminergic, cholinergic, and noradrenergic receptors.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Prochlorperazine's primary mechanism involves the blocking of D2 dopamine receptors. It also affects several other receptors, including Histamine H1 (HRH1) and multiple alpha-adrenergic receptors (ADRA1A, ADRA1B, ADRA1D, ADRA2A, ADRA2B, and ADRA2C), which contribute to its antiemetic, sedative, muscle relaxation, and hypotensive effects. Metabolism of the drug occurs primarily in the liver with cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) as a key enzyme in its oxidative metabolism pathway. This can lead to the formation of multiple metabolites like N-desmethyl prochlorperazine and prochlorperazine sulfoxide. There are no specific carriers or transporters listed for the drug.

## Pharmacogenetics
Regarding pharmacogenetics, CYP2D6 plays a critical role in the metabolism of prochlorperazine. Variability in CYP2D6 activity, due to genetic polymorphisms, can significantly impact the drug's pharmacokinetics and, consequently, its efficacy and safety profile. Individuals who are poor metabolizers (PMs) of CYP2D6 may experience increased plasma levels of prochlorperazine, leading to heightened susceptibility to side effects like extrapyramidal symptoms or sedation. Conversely, rapid metabolizers (RMs) might require higher doses to achieve therapeutic effects. However, detailed pharmacogenomic data specifically correlating CYP2D6 polymorphisms with clinical outcomes during prochlorperazine therapy are limited, suggesting an area for further clinical research.
