## Drug Summary
Rosuvastatin is a lipid-lowering agent belonging to the statin class, primarily used to manage dyslipidemia and prevent cardiovascular diseases by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis in the liver. It competitively inhibits the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which is crucial for the biosynthesis of mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol. Rosuvastatin distinguishes itself from other statins by its high hydrophilicity and minimal metabolism through the Cytochrome P450 system, specifically CYP3A4, allowing for fewer drug-drug interactions. Unlike other statins extensively metabolized by CYP3A4, rosuvastatin is mainly metabolized by CYP2C9 and excreted unmetabolized. This pharmacokinetic profile contributes to its potent effects on lowering LDL cholesterol substantially more efficiently compared to others like atorvastatin. Despite its high potency, clinical studies such as the SATURN trial confirmed there is no significant difference between rosuvastatin and less potent statins on atherosclerosis progression.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Rosuvastatin's principal target, HMGCR, is inhibited to reduce cholesterol synthesis. It also shows pleiotropic effects possibly by modulating ITGAL, a gene encoding the leukocyte adhesion molecule involved in immune response. The drugâ€™s minimal metabolism is primarily catalyzed by CYP2C9. Key transporters facilitating its hepatic uptake include SLCO1B1 and others in the SLCO family, which can impact drug distribution and elimination. Rosuvastatin also interacts with other transporters like ABCG2 (BCRP), influencing its absorption and systemic availability. Interaction with these transporters can lead to variability in drug levels and response due to genetic variations.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of rosuvastatin are critical for its efficacy and safety profile, impacting its metabolism, distribution, and excretion. Variants in SLCO1B1 and ABCG2, transporters involved in hepatic uptake and intestinal absorption respectively, significantly influence rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics. For example, carriers of the SLCO1B1 *15 allele (c.521T>C) exhibit increased plasma levels of rosuvastatin, raising the risk of adverse effects like myopathy. Similarly, the ABCG2 c.421C>A polymorphism, more frequent in Asian populations, results in higher systemic exposure to rosuvastatin, requiring dose adjustments. Pharmacogenetic testing for these variants might be advised to personalize rosuvastatin therapy and mitigate risks, particularly concerning muscle toxicity and other side effects. Furthermore, polymorphisms in HMGCR, like rs17244841, have been linked to variable responses in LDL cholesterol reduction, directly influencing its therapeutic outcomes.
