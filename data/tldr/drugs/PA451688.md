## Drug Summary
Tiludronic acid, also known by the generic name tiludronate, is a first-generation bisphosphonate, structurally and functionally related to other bisphosphonates such as etidronic and clodronic acids. Approved by the FDA in 1997, it is primarily indicated for treating Paget's disease of bone in patients exhibiting elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase, symptomatic cases, or those at risk of future complications. Its pharmacodynamics involve inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Tiludronic acid binds to bone mineral (hydroxyapatite) and is released upon acidification by osteoclasts during bone resorption. This process prevents osteoclasts from forming podosome structures essential for bone resorption, thus reducing bone turnover. Pharmacokinetically, it shows low oral bioavailability ranging from 2-11% and is not metabolized in human liver microsomes, leading to a potential for long duration of activity within bone tissues.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Tiludronic acid targets several proteins, primarily those involved in the function and structure of osteoclasts. Key targets include tyrosine-protein phosphatases (PTPN12, PTPN6, PTPRE) which are involved in the organization of cytoskeletal structures necessary for osteoclast attachment to the bone. It also inhibits various subunits of the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) enzyme (such as ATP6V0A1, ATP6V0A2, and others), disrupting acidification critical for bone resorption. Additionally, tiludronic acid binds to serum albumin (ALB), which may impact its distribution and clearance kinetics. There are no significant interactions with metabolic enzymes or transporters listed, in line with its lack of metabolic transformation.

## Pharmacogenetics
As of the current knowledge, there is no specific pharmacogenetic data provided for tiludronic acid, nor are there extensive studies linking its pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics to genetic variations in the patient population. Given its mechanism involving multiple osteoclast-specific enzymes and structural proteins, variations in genes encoding these targets (such as differences in V-ATPase subunits or tyrosine phosphatases) could hypothetically influence the drug's efficacy and safety. However, actual clinical genetic associations would need further exploration and validation in pharmacogenetic studies. Therefore, while potential genetic influences on treatment outcomes with tiludronic acid are biologically plausible, they are not currently documented or used in clinical practice.
