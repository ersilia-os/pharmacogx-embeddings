## Drug Summary
Deferasirox is an oral iron chelator primarily used for treating chronic iron overload in patients who require long-term blood transfusions, such as those with transfusional hemosiderosis. Approved by the FDA, it is selective for binding ferric iron (Fe3+), facilitating the removal of excess iron from the body. Deferasirox operates by binding to iron in a 2:1 ratio, forming a stable complex that is predominantly excreted through the kidneys. The drug exhibits an oral bioavailability of approximately 70%. Despite its specificity for iron, it can cause decreases in serum concentrations of other trace metals like zinc and copper, though the clinical relevance of these effects is unclear. Metabolism of deferasirox is primarily through glucuronidation rather than CYP450 oxidation, with biliary excretion.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Deferasirox does not have specific molecular targets in terms of traditional receptor-ligand binding, given its function as an iron chelator. However, in terms of drug metabolism, several enzymes are involved. The key enzymes in the metabolism of deferasirox include UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) such as UGT1A1, UGT1A3, and UGT1A9, which are primarily responsible for its glucuronidation process. The drug has minor interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes, mainly involving CYP1A2, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4, which play a lesser role in its oxidative metabolism. There are no specific transporters or carriers identified that are significantly involved in its pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic aspects of deferasirox primarily relate to its metabolism by UGT and CYP enzymes. Variability in UGT1A1, UGT1A3, and UGT1A9 gene expression or function could potentially influence the pharmacokinetics and toxicity profile of deferasirox. For instance, individuals with genetic variants leading to diminished UGT activity might experience altered drug clearance and increased risk of adverse effects. Similarly, genetic polymorphisms in CYP enzymes like CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and CYP1A2 could modify the minor pathways of deferasirox metabolism, impacting drug levels and efficacy. While specific studies linking these genetic variations to clinical outcomes in deferasirox-treated patients might be sparse, these enzymes' roles suggest potential areas for pharmacogenetic research and personalized medicine approaches.
