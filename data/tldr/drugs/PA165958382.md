## Drug Summary
Methacholine, marketed as PROVOCHOLINEÂ®, is a non-specific cholinergic (parasympathomimetic) agonist used primarily for the methacholine challenge test to diagnose bronchial airway hyperreactivity (AHR) in individuals without clinically apparent asthma. Approved by the FDA in 1986, it operates via muscarinic receptors to induce bronchoconstriction. This action is notably more pronounced in patients with asthma, leveraging methacholine's sensitivity to AHR to aid in diagnosis. The drug poses a risk of severe bronchoconstriction, particularly in patients with pre-existing reduced pulmonary function or other respiratory illnesses. It can also adversely affect conditions exacerbated by cholinergic stimulation, such as epilepsy or peptic ulcers.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Methacholine acts on various subtypes of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), though its clinical use in diagnosing asthma primarily involves the M3 receptor subtype. Activation of M3 receptors on airway smooth muscle cells leads to bronchoconstriction. Besides M3, methacholine can also activate M1, M2, M4, and M5 receptors, with the M2 subtype playing a role in inhibiting acetylcholine release at neuronal junctions, impacting ASM contraction. The drug's effects are associated with the modulation of calcium-dependent signaling pathways in the lungs. Methacholine is known to be transported by SLC22A5 (solute carrier family 22 member 5), which may play a role in its cellular uptake and systemic distribution, although details on the impact of this transporter on methacholine's pharmacokinetics are not fully established.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is limited specific pharmacogenetic data available for methacholine, but its action via muscarinic receptors suggests potential variability in drug responses linked to genetic differences in these receptors. Genetic variations in CHRM2, CHRM3, and potentially other muscarinic receptors may affect individual sensitivity to methacholine, influencing both therapeutic outcomes and risks of adverse reactions. Additionally, genes affecting the function of transporters like SLC22A5 could modify the pharmacokinetics of methacholine, although direct evidence linking these genetic factors to clinical effects in methacholine challenge testing is currently lacking. Further studies could help clarify these associations and potentially aid in more personalized application and safety monitoring of the methacholine challenge test.
