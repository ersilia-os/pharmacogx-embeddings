## Drug Summary
Voxilaprevir is a Direct-Acting Antiviral (DAA) drug, used in combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infections across genotypes 1-6. It was approved by the FDA in July 2017 as part of the combination product Vosevi, which also includes sofosbuvir and velpatasvir. It specifically targets the NS3/4A serine protease in HCV, crucial for viral replication and maturation. Voxilaprevir inhibits this protease, leading to a cessation of the virus's life cycle and preventing the virus from multiplying. Voxilaprevir's pharmacokinetics include a peak concentration time of 4 hours when administered with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir, and it is primarily metabolized by the enzyme CYP3A4, with additional involvement of CYP2C8 and CYP1A2.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary target of Voxilaprevir is the NS3/4A protein in HCV, responsible for the cleavage of HCV polyprotein into functional units essential for viral assembly and replication. This specific targeting significantly disrupts the HCV replication complex. Metabolically, Voxilaprevir is predominantly processed by Cytochrome P450 enzymes, primarily CYP3A4, and to lesser extents by CYP2C8 and CYP1A2. Its absorption and distribution are influenced by transporters such as P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2), and the solute carrier organic anion transporter family members SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3. No specific carriers are identified in the provided data.

## Pharmacogenetics
Voxilaprevir's effectiveness can be influenced by genetic variations in enzymes and transporters involved in its metabolism and transport. Polymorphisms in CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and CYP1A2 might affect the pharmacokinetics of voxilaprevir, impacting drug levels and therapeutic outcomes. Similarly, genetic variants in ABCB1, ABCG2, SLCO1B1, and SLCO1B3 could influence drug absorption and disposition, potentially leading to variability in efficacy and toxicity. While specific genetic interactions are not detailed in the provided information, these could serve as areas for pharmacogenetic research. Knowledge of these genetic variations could guide personalized dosing strategies to optimize efficacy and minimize adverse effects.
