## Drug Summary
Aripiprazole lauroxil, marketed as Aristada, is a long-acting injectable atypical antipsychotic approved for treating schizophrenia in adults. It functions as a prodrug of aripiprazole. Upon administration, aripiprazole lauroxil is hydrolyzed into its active form, which exhibits pharmacological activity through dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT receptors, influencing both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. This drug's efficacy in controlling schizophrenia symptoms is coupled with minimal sexual dysfunction and negligible effects on prolactin levels. It is administered intramuscularly with the need for tolerability confirmation in treatment-na√Øve patients. Aripiprazole lauroxil's pharmacokinetics involve measurable systemic circulation of aripiprazole within 5-6 days post-administration, reaching steady state by the fourth monthly injection.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Aripiprazole lauroxil primarily targets multiple dopamine and serotonin receptors, such as DRD2, HTR1A, and HTR2A, wherein its action on these receptors modulates dopaminergic and serotonergic signaling critical for its therapeutic effects in schizophrenia. The metabolism of aripiprazole lauroxil into its active form involves hydrolysis by esterases and further breakdown by cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, into dehydro-aripiprazole which still possesses pharmacological activity. The drug binds to serum albumin (ALB), which may affect its pharmacokinetics and distribution. The absence of specific transporters mentioned suggests limited interaction or uncharacterized transport mechanisms.

## Pharmacogenetics
The metabolism of aripiprazole by CYP2D6 is particularly relevant for pharmacogenetic considerations. CYP2D6 exhibits genetic polymorphism which influences the enzyme's activity ranging from poor to ultra-rapid metabolism. Such variability can significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole, necessitating dose adjustments to achieve optimal therapeutic effects or avoid adverse reactions. Genetic testing for CYP2D6 variants prior to treatment may be beneficial for tailoring individual doses, enhancing therapeutic outcomes, and minimizing side effects. Although data on other genetic factors influencing aripiprazole lauroxil's action remain limited, the implications of CYP2D6 polymorphisms are well-documented and critical in clinical settings for optimizing dosing regimens and maximizing therapeutic efficacy.
