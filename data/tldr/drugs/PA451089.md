## Drug Summary
Pravastatin, also known under brand names such as Elisor, Lipostat, Mevalotin, Pravaselect, and Selipran, is a lipid-lowering agent belonging to the statin class. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1991. Pravastatin is a direct active form of the drug, not a prodrug, and functions by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a crucial role in the hepatic production of cholesterol. With a low bioavailability of 17%, pravastatin is absorbed within 1-1.5 hours post-administration and primarily undergoes first-pass hepatic extraction. Its metabolism mainly involves glucuronidation reactions with negligible involvement of CYP450 enzymes, and it does not produce active metabolites. It significantly reduces LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglycerides, while modestly increasing HDL cholesterol.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Pravastatin’s primary target is HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), which it inhibits, thereby lowering cholesterol synthesis and increasing LDL receptor expression on hepatocytes. This enhances the clearance of LDL cholesterol from the circulation. Pravastatin also interacts with histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), although the clinical implications of this are less clear. The drug is not extensively metabolized by enzymes but involves several transporters for its hepatic uptake and renal and biliary excretion. These include SLCO1B1, SLCO2B1, ABCB1, SLC22A6, SLC22A8, and others involved in organic anion transport.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors influence pravastatin’s efficacy and safety. The variant rs20455 in the gene KIF6 is associated with a greater reduction in cardiovascular events in patients treated with high-dose pravastatin, indicating a potential benefit from genotype-based dosing. Additionally, the rs17244841 variant in HMGCR, the drug’s target enzyme, is linked to a lesser reduction in LDL cholesterol levels with pravastatin treatment. These genomic interactions highlight the importance of considering genetic factors in optimizing pravastatin therapy for individual patients, potentially guiding more personalized treatment strategies in clinical settings.
