## Drug Summary
Tigecycline, marketed under the brand name Tygacil, is a glycylcycline antibiotic developed by Wyeth. It received fast-track FDA approval in 2005 primarily for combating antibiotic-resistant infections. Tigecycline is indicated for the treatment of various complicated infections, including skin and intra-abdominal infections caused by specific susceptible bacterial strains such as *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Escherichia coli*, and *Enterococcus faecalis*. As a derivative of tetracycline, tigecycline functions by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis in bacteria. This binding is more effective than traditional tetracyclines, which helps it overcome common resistance mechanisms—efflux pumps and ribosomal protection. Tigecycline is not extensively metabolized in the body, primarily being excreted unchanged, and has minimal interactions with human liver enzymes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary mechanism of action of tigecycline is the inhibition of protein synthesis through its interaction with the 30S ribosomal subunit in bacteria. The drug targets several ribosomal proteins within this subunit including 30S ribosomal protein S9 (rpsI), S12 (rpsL), S13 (rpsM), S14 (rpsN), and S19 (rpsS), all from *Escherichia coli* strain K12. By binding to these proteins, tigecycline effectively prevents the attachment of amino-acyl tRNA to the ribosome’s A site, thus interrupting protein elongation. This broad-spectrum activity is crucial for its effectiveness against resistant pathogens. There have been no significant transporter or enzyme interactions identified, nor are there any carriers associated with its metabolic process, which simplifies its pharmacokinetic profile.

## Pharmacogenetics
Given the lack of extensive metabolism and the primary excretion route of tigecycline being unchanged by the body, significant pharmacogenetic interactions are not extensively documented compared to other drugs where metabolism plays a larger role in their efficacy and safety profile. Furthermore, there is no specific genomic data provided for tigecycline that would imply variances in patient responses due to genetic differences. Future research could potentially explore genetic factors that may influence the efficacy and toxicity of tigecycline, particularly in populations that show differential responses to other antibiotics. As of now, clinical considerations are predominantly guided by microbiological susceptibility rather than individual genetic differences.
