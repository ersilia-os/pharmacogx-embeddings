## Drug Summary
Lumacaftor is used in combination with ivacaftor under the brand name Orkambi for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) in patients aged one year and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. CF is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by mutations in the CFTR gene, affecting chloride and sodium ion transport across cell membranes, leading to thick, sticky mucus production in various organs. Introduced in 2015, lumacaftor acts as a protein-folding chaperone, improving the conformational stability of the F508del-CFTR protein, thereby facilitating increased processing, trafficking, and function of this protein at the cell surface. The drug primarily reduces sweat chloride levels and modestly improves lung function and overall symptomatology in CF patients, associating these changes with reduced pulmonary exacerbations and enhanced weight gain.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Lumacaftor targets the CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator), enhancing its conformational stability and increasing the quantity and function of mutated CFTR at the cell surface. Lumacaftor is metabolized principally via oxidation and glucuronidation by cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. It shows interactions with the transporter ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), and the carrier protein involved is ALB (Serum Albumin). These interactions potentially influence the absorption, distribution, and elimination of lumacaftor, altering its bioavailability and therapeutic effectiveness.

## Pharmacogenetics
The genetic background of CF patients, particularly the presence of the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene, is crucial for the therapeutic action of lumacaftor. This mutation leads to protein misfolding and defective chloride ion channel function. Lumacaftor is specifically beneficial in patients homozygous for the F508del mutation, where it acts to stabilize the defective CFTR protein, thus facilitating its proper function. Given the variety of mutations associated with CF, lumacaftor's effectiveness can vary significantly, stressing the importance of genetic screening prior to therapy initiation. Additionally, the enzymes involved in lumacaftor metabolism, like CYP3A4, may also exhibit genetic polymorphisms that could affect drug levels and response, although specific pharmacogenetic guidelines for modulating lumacaftor dosage based on these variations are not yet well established.
