## Drug Summary
Nimodipine, marketed under brand names such as Periplum, is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker primarily affecting cerebral circulation. As a selective cerebral vasodilator, it is specifically indicated to mitigate neurological damage following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from ruptured intracranial berry aneurysms. Nimodipine's action mechanism predominantly involves the stabilization of voltage-gated L-type calcium channels in their inactive conformation across vascular smooth muscle cells, neuronal cells, and myocardial cells, thereby inhibiting calcium influx that is crucial for smooth muscle contraction and subsequent vasoconstriction. It is highly lipophilic, allowing it to cross the blood-brain barrier effectively, and is primarily absorbed orally with a bioavailability ranging from 3-30% due to significant first-pass metabolism. Peak drug concentrations are generally reached within one hour after oral administration.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Nimodipine acts on several targets, mainly involving various subunits of the voltage-dependent L-type calcium channel found in humans. These include alpha subunits (CACNA1C, CACNA1D, CACNA1F, CACNA1S) and beta subunits (CACNB1, CACNB2, CACNB3, CACNB4), facilitating its prominent effects on calcium mediation in cardiovascular and neurological contexts. Besides these, nimodipine also interacts with the mineralocorticoid receptor (NR3C2) and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), both significant in physiological and pathophysiological processes. The drug is metabolized in the liver predominantly through cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), which plays a critical role in its metabolic clearance. There is no notable interaction with typical drug transporters or carriers listed.

## Pharmacogenetics
In terms of pharmacogenetics, the metabolism of nimodipine through CYP3A4 is of particular importance. Variations in the CYP3A4 gene can influence the metabolism rate of nimodipine, thereby affecting drug levels in the blood and potentially altering efficacy and safety profiles. For instance, individuals with certain polymorphisms in the CYP3A4 gene might exhibit slower or faster metabolism of nimodipine, leading to higher risk of adverse effects or decreased therapeutic effectiveness, respectively. Considering its substantial first-pass metabolism mediated by CYP3A4, genetic variations in this enzyme could significantly influence both systemic circulation levels and bioavailability of nimodipine. However, direct clinical guidelines linking specific CYP3A4 variants with Nimodipine dosing adjustments are currently not well-established, emphasizing a need for personalized medicine approaches and further pharmacogenetic investigations in patients treated with nimodipine.
