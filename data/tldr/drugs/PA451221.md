## Drug Summary
Raloxifene, also known as Keoxifene, is a second-generation selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) classified under antiestrogens. Marketed under the name EvistaÂ®, it is primarily used in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and for reducing the risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women either with osteoporosis or at high risk. Raloxifene exhibits estrogenic actions on bone and lipid metabolism while exerts anti-estrogenic effects on breast and uterine tissues. It enhances bone mineral density by decreasing bone resorption and increasing bone formation through its agonistic action on bone estrogen receptors. Raloxifene is generally well absorbed orally, albeit with a low bioavailability due to substantial first-pass metabolism, predominantly through glucuronidation, without involving the cytochrome P450 enzyme system.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Raloxifene primarily interacts with the estrogen receptors ESR1 (Estrogen receptor alpha) and ESR2 (Estrogen receptor beta), acting as an agonist in bone tissues and antagonist in breast tissues. Metabolically, it undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism to form raloxifene glucuronide conjugates, facilitated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases such as UGT1A1, UGT1A8, and UGT1A10. Although not significantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, interactions with CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4 are noted. For transport, raloxifene utilizes transporters like ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), ABCG2 (Breast cancer resistance protein), and various members of the solute carrier organic anion transporter family, including SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3. It also binds to carriers such as serum albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic aspects of raloxifene are particularly relevant given its interaction with specific estrogen receptors and transporters. For instance, genetic variations in the estrogen receptor genes ESR1 and ESR2 might influence the therapeutic response of raloxifene in bone density enhancement and breast cancer risk reduction. Moreover, polymorphisms in transporter genes like ABCB1 and ABCG2 could affect the drug's bioavailability and disposition, potentially altering efficacy and safety. While specific pharmacogenetic guidelines for raloxifene are not fully established, understanding these genetic factors could improve personalized medicine approaches in managing postmenopausal conditions. Analyzing genotypes for these targets may help predict response variability and optimize raloxifene therapy, although further studies are needed to substantiate these associations.
