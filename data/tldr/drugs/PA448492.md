## Drug Summary
Asparaginase Escherichia coli, also marketed under names like Elspar, is an enzyme used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as part of a multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimen. Derived from _Escherichia coli_, this drug hydrolyzes L-asparagine into L-aspartic acid and ammonia, essentially depriving leukemic cells of asparagine necessary for their proliferation and survival. L-asparagine is a non-essential amino acid vital for DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis in cells. While normal cells can synthesize asparagine, leukemic cells lack this capability and rely on external asparagine sources. Asparaginase Escherichia coli is administered via intramuscular or intravenous injections, and achieves peak plasma levels within 24 to 48 hours after dosing. The therapeutic effects manifest by significantly low plasma and cerebrospinal fluid asparagine levels, ultimately disrupting leukemic cell metabolism and inducing apoptosis.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Asparaginase Escherichia coli acts directly on the substrate L-asparagine, converting it to L-aspartic acid and ammonia, and does not have specific molecular targets like receptors or enzymes. The mechanism involves directly reducing available asparagine levels rather than acting through modulation of other cellular processes. There were no specific transporters or enzymes listed in the provided data that are directly involved in the drugâ€™s action. However, the drug is associated with a carrier protein, SERPINA7, known as Thyroxine-binding globulin, though the clinical relevance of this interaction specifically with respect to asparaginase's pharmacological activity is not detailed in the provided data.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is no detailed pharmacogenetic data provided specifically for Asparaginase Escherichia coli. However, pharmacogenetic considerations in treatments involving asparaginase generally include variations in genes related to drug hypersensitivity and metabolism. For instance, hypersensitivity reactions are a significant concern with asparaginase, and genetic variations might influence these adverse effects. The alternative formulations like PEGylated or Erwinia chrysanthemi-derived asparaginase are recommended for patients who develop hypersensitivity. Additionally, variations in genes encoding metabolic enzymes and proteins involved in immune modulation could potentially influence treatment efficacy and safety, though specific gene-drug interactions have not been robustly documented and would benefit from further research to clarify their clinical implications.
