## Drug Summary
Imipramine, marketed under various names such as Antidep and Depsonil, is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), specifically a dibenzazepine derivative. It is primarily used to treat symptoms of depression and nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting) in children. Imipramine exhibits a broad spectrum of pharmacological effects, acting as a potent inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, which enhances mood and emotional wellbeing in depressed patients. Its pharmacodynamic profile also includes the blockade of various receptors including histamine H₁, muscarinic cholinergic, and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, contributing to its range of therapeutic and side effects. This drug is rapidly absorbed in the small intestine, with a variable bioavailability between 29-77% after oral administration. It undergoes extensive metabolism, primarily in the liver, with CYP2D6 playing a significant role in converting imipramine to its active metabolite, desipramine.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Imipramine interacts with multiple molecular targets. It inhibits the sodium-dependent serotonin (SLC6A4) and norepinephrine (SLC6A2) transporters, leading to increased neurotransmitter levels in the synaptic cleft, essential for its antidepressant effects. Additionally, it antagonizes various receptors including histamine H₁ (HRH1), multiple muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM2, CHRM3, CHRM4, CHRM5), and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors (ADRA1A, ADRA1B, ADRA1D), contributing to both its therapeutic actions and side effects. Imipramine is metabolized predominantly by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. It impacts transport systems such as P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and various solute carrier family members (SLC22A2, SLC22A3, SLC22A4), affecting its distribution and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic variants significantly influence imipramine's metabolism and efficacy. Polymorphisms in CYP2D6, such as rs3892097, rs35742686, rs5030655, rs1135824, and rs28371733, are associated with poor metabolism of imipramine, leading to higher plasma levels and increased risk of side effects. Similarly, variants in CYP2C19, like rs4244285 and rs4986893, impact its metabolic rate, affecting drug concentration and response. These genetic factors should be considered in personalized medicine to optimize dosage and minimize adverse effects, providing a basis for tailored therapeutic strategies in treating depression and other off-label conditions managed by imipramine.
