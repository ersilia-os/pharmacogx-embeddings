## Drug Summary
Gabapentin, a structural analogue of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), was first approved in 1993 for use in the United States. It is primarily used to manage neuropathic pain and as an anti-epileptic agent for treating certain types of seizures. Gabapentin functions by inhibiting the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, which aids in managing neuropathic pain and seizure disorders. It is known for a favorable adverse effect profile, a wide therapeutic index, and minimal pharmacokinetic drug interactions due to its lack of appreciable metabolism in humans. The drug is not significantly metabolized, with less than 1% of it converted to metabolites, and the majority is excreted unchanged in urine.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Gabapentin principally acts by binding to the auxiliary α2δ-1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, found on presynaptic neurons, which helps reduce excitatory neurotransmitter release. There's a lower affinity for the α2δ-2 subunit. Other potential sites of activity include adenosine A1 receptors (ADORA1) and voltage-gated potassium channels (KCNQ3, KCNQ5), though their clinical relevance is not well-defined. Absorption of gabapentin involves the LAT1 transporter (SLC7A5), and its bioavailability decreases with increasing doses, attributed to the saturable absorption process. Notably, there are no specific carriers involved in its transport.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is limited specific pharmacogenetic data for gabapentin in the public domain currently. However, general awareness in the field suggests that genetic variants affecting the expression or function of calcium channels (specifically CACNA2D1, CACNA2D2) could potentially influence the drug's efficacy or safety profile, though more empirical evidence is required to substantiate these inferences. Additionally, variations in SLC7A5, the transporter involved in gabapentin's absorption, could potentially impact its pharmacokinetics, affecting drug levels and thus efficacy and side effect profiles. Given gabapentin's mechanism of action and its targets, further studies might explore the genomic influences impacting patient responses to gabapentin, particularly concerning pain management and seizure control.
