## Drug Summary
Vardenafil, marketed under the brand names Levitra and Staxyn, is a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). It is primarily used as an oral therapy for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Vardenafil functions by enhancing the effects of nitric oxide (NO) released during sexual stimulation, which increases cGMP in smooth muscle cells leading to muscle relaxation and increased blood flow in the penis, thus facilitating erection. The FDA approved vardenafil in 2003. It exhibits a dose-proportional pharmacokinetics profile with about 15% bioavailability. It is mainly metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4, with its major circulating metabolite, M1, contributing to its pharmacological activity. Vardenafil is associated with a risk of priapism, sudden hearing loss, and vision changes, and should not be used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Vardenafil's primary target is PDE5A, an enzyme involved in the degradation of cGMP within the corpus cavernosum. By inhibiting PDE5A, vardenafil increases cGMP levels, promoting smooth muscle relaxation and penile erection. It also has minor affinity towards PDE6G and PDE6H, phosphodiesterases present in retinal photoreceptors, which might relate to visual disturbances as side effects. Vardenafil is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A5, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1) acts as a transporter which could influence its distribution and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
Vardenafil metabolism is chiefly mediated by CYP3A4, with contributions from CYP3A5 and CYP2C isoforms. Variations in the genes encoding these enzymes could affect the drug's pharmacokinetics and individual responses. For instance, CYP3A5 expressers (carriers of the *1 allele) might metabolize vardenafil faster than non-expressers, potentially altering efficacy or risk of side effects. Similarly, inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 could impact vardenafil's plasma levels, warranting dosage adjustments. However, specific genetic markers directly influencing vardenafil response or toxicity have not been robustly identified, and more research is needed to establish firm pharmacogenetic guidelines for its clinical use. Further investigations are essential to better understand inter-individual variability in response to vardenafil based on genetic factors.
