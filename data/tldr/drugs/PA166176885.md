## Drug Summary
Dihydrocodeine, also marketed under names such as Codidol and Contugesic, is a semi-synthetic opioid analgesic. Developed in Germany in 1908, it is primarily used to treat moderate to severe pain, including post-operative and dental pain, chronic pain conditions, severe dyspnea, and as an antitussive. It has also been utilized as an alternative in heroin addiction therapy. Dihydrocodeine has a low oral bioavailability of approximately 20%, attributed to poor gastrointestinal absorption and extensive first-pass metabolism. Pharmacodynamically, it is known to cause typical opioid-related side effects like drowsiness, nausea, and constipation. It is also associated with effects such as mild euphoria.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Dihydrocodeine primarily acts through its metabolism to the highly active metabolite dihydromorphine, which has a strong affinity for mu-opioid receptors. The drug is metabolized in the liver where it undergoes transformation by two major cytochrome P450 enzymes: CYP2D6 is responsible for converting Dihydrocodeine into its active metabolite dihydromorphine, whereas CYP3A4 contributes to its conversion into the less active metabolite nordihydrocodeine and dihydrocodeine-6-glucuronide. There is no specific information provided on direct drug transporters or carriers involved in dihydrocodeine's action or pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
The metabolism of Dihydrocodeine significantly involves the CYP2D6 enzyme, which is known for its genetic polymorphism impacting drug response. Variants in the CYP2D6 gene can lead to differences in enzyme activity ranging from poor to ultrarapid metabolism. Individuals who are poor metabolizers may experience reduced efficacy of dihydrocodeine, as less active metabolite dihydromorphine is produced. Conversely, ultrarapid metabolizers may be at higher risk for toxicity due to faster and possibly excessive production of the active metabolites. This pharmacogenetic variance necessitates caution and potentially adjusted dosages to manage the therapeutic response effectively. Specific genomic data related to other aspects of dihydrocodeine pharmacogenetics are not provided, indicating a need for further research in this area.
