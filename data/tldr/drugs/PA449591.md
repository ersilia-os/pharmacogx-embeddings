## Drug Summary
Felodipine is a dihydropyridine-class calcium channel blocker (CCB) extensively used in managing mild to moderate essential hypertension. It operates by stabilizing voltage-gated L-type and T-type calcium channels in their inactive states, primarily impacting vascular smooth muscle cells to reduce calcium influx, which lessens myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. This mechanism results in powerful vasodilation and decreased blood pressure. Felodipine shows selectivity for arterial smooth muscle due to alternative splicing of the alpha-1 subunit of the channel, making it especially effective in targeting peripheral vascular resistance without notable cardiac depressant effects. It is well-absorbed via the gastrointestinal tract, though its systemic availability is limited to around 15% due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism, principally via CYP3A4.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Felodipine exhibits affinity to multiple targets beyond the primary voltage-gated L-type calcium channels (CACNA1C, CACNA1D, CACNA1S) including T-type calcium channels (CACNA1H). This drug also interacts with calcium channel subunits alpha-2/delta-1 and alpha-2/delta-2 (CACNA2D1, CACNA2D2). Beyond its ion channel activity, felodipine inhibits calmodulin (CALM1), which plays a role in calcium signaling, and phosphodiesterases PDE1A and PDE1B, which are involved in cyclic nucleotide metabolism. Furthermore, it antagonizes the mineralocorticoid receptor (NR3C2) and binds to isoforms of troponin C (TNNC1, TNNC2), which are crucial in muscle contraction regulation. Metabolism is predominantly via CYP3A4 with additional involvement from CYP3A5, CYP3A7, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. Key transporters involved include P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1) and the bile salt export pump (ABCB11), affecting drug disposition.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of felodipine is primarily related to its metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes, especially CYP3A4. Genetic variability in CYP3A4 can alter the metabolic clearance of felodipine, influencing both its efficacy and toxicity. Individuals with certain polymorphisms that lead to reduced CYP3A4 activity might experience increased plasma concentrations of felodipine, predisposing them to greater hypotensive effects or adverse reactions such as peripheral edema or excessive vasodilation. Conversely, individuals with genotypes causing enhanced CYP3A4 activity may require higher doses to achieve therapeutic effects. The expression and function of transporters such as ABCB1 also contribute to interindividual variability in felodipine's pharmacokinetics and responses. This suggests that pharmacogenetic testing could guide individualized dosing strategies to optimize efficacy and safety in hypertension management, although such practices are not yet commonplace in clinical settings.
