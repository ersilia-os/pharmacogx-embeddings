## Drug Summary
Erdafitinib, marketed as Balversa by Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, is the first fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) kinase inhibitor approved by the FDA for treating locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma with susceptible FGFR3 or FGFR2 genetic alterations. This indication comes after progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy. The drug is a pan-FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor affecting FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4, which are implicated in various cancers, including urothelial cancer. Erdafitinib functions through the inhibition of FGFR phosphorylation, impacting cell viability in cancerous cells expressing FGFR genetic alterations.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Erdafitinib targets multiple receptors including FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, RET, CSF1R, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, KIT, and KDR, all crucial in cellular processes like proliferation and anti-apoptosis. Metabolism of erdafitinib involves primarily the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Regarding transport, erdafitinib interacts with the ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1) transporter and SLC22A2 (solute carrier family 22 member 2). Additionally, it binds to ORM2 (alpha1-acid glycoprotein) which acts as a carrier, potentially affecting its pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of erdafitinib is especially relevant due to its indication for patients with specific FGFR genetic alterations, highlighting its role in personalized medicine. Patients are selected for therapy based on FGFR3 or FGFR2 mutations, detected via the FDA-approved companion diagnostic, therascreen FGFR RGQ RT-PCR Kit. Furthermore, variations in the CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 genes, responsible for the drug's metabolism, can significantly affect its pharmacokinetics and toxicity profile. Particularly, individuals with the CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype might have higher plasma levels of erdafitinib, prompting careful monitoring for increased adverse reactions. Thus, erdafitinib's use highlights the integration of genetic testing into therapeutic decision-making to optimize treatment outcomes and manage risks effectively.
