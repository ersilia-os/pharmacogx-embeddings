## Drug Summary
Dasatinib is an orally available small-molecule multikinase inhibitor primarily used to treat Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), particularly in cases where there is resistance or intolerance to prior therapy such as imatinib. Dasatinib was first approved by the FDA in 2006 and is effective due to its ability to inhibit multiple tyrosine kinases including BCR-ABL, SRC-family kinases, and others at nanomolar concentrations. It has a range of side effects such as myelosuppression, fluid retention, and cardiotoxicity. The drug is metabolized mainly via CYP3A4, and its absorption and elimination are dose-proportional with a pharmacokinetic profile that shows significant food effect.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Dasatinib acts on numerous targets including ABL1, SRC, LCK, KIT, EPHA2, PDGFRB, and STAT5B among others. It binds to both active and inactive conformations of the ABL kinase domain, which is important in overcoming resistance to other drugs like imatinib. Metabolism of dasatinib involves primarily CYP3A4, but also CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, CYP3A5, and FMO3. Important transporters for dasatinib include ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1) and ABCG2, which can affect the drug's distribution and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
Dasatinib's metabolism via CYP3A4 suggests potential variability in response based on genetic variants affecting the expression or function of this enzyme. For instance, individuals with certain CYP3A4 polymorphisms may exhibit differences in dasatinib metabolism, impacting drug levels and possibly leading to altered efficacy or toxicity, although specific pharmacogenetic guidelines for dasatinib dosage adjustment based on CYP3A4 variants are not currently established in clinical practice. Furthermore, transporters such as ABCB1 and ABCG2 are known to be affected by genetic polymorphisms that could influence drug efflux and consequently dasatinib bioavailability and side effects. Monitoring for genetic variations in these transporters may be advisable to predict patient response, especially in terms of drug resistance or increased toxicity.
