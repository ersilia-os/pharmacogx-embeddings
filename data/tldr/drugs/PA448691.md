## Drug Summary
Busulfan is a bifunctional alkylating agent primarily utilized in the conditioning regimen prior to allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation for various diseases, including chronic myeloid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. As an alkylating agent, busulfan functions by introducing alkyl groups into DNA strands, thus cross-linking DNA and inhibiting DNA replication and RNA transcription. This results in disrupted nucleic acid function and subsequent cell death. It has a complete absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and significant hepatic metabolism. It is important to note that busulfan is recognized as a known carcinogen and has several severe side effects, including potential for organ damage and marrow suppression.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Busulfan does not have dedicated targeting data provided; however, its primary action is through DNA alkylation. Key enzymes involved in its metabolism include several isoforms of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) such as GSTM1, GSTP1, GSTA1, and GSTA2, which catalyze its conjugation with glutathione. Additionally, busulfan is metabolized by microsomal glutathione S-transferase 2 (MGST2) and cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). These enzymes play critical roles in detoxifying busulfan, forming less active metabolites and facilitating drug excretion. However, the specific roles of transporters and carriers in busulfan pharmacokinetics are not detailed.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic interactions of busulfan primarily involve variations in genes encoding for its metabolizing enzymes. Polymorphisms in GST genes can profoundly affect an individual's response to busulfan, as these enzymes are crucial for its detoxification and clearance. For instance, variations in GSTM1 or the presence of null alleles may influence busulfan metabolism and toxicity, potentially necessitating dosage adjustments. Furthermore, activities of CYP3A4, involved in a minor pathway of busulfan metabolism, can also vary based on genetic makeup, affecting overall drug levels and side effects. These pharmacogenetic factors should be considered to optimize dosing and minimize toxicity in individual patients.
