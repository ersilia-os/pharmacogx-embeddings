## Drug Summary
Valproic acid, also known by trade names such as Depakene, Convulex, and Epilim, is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug first synthesized in 1881 and approved by the FDA in 1978. It is primarily used to treat various seizure disorders, including complex partial seizures and simple or complex absence seizures, either as monotherapy or adjunctively. Additionally, it is indicated for the prophylaxis of migraine headaches, and the management of manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder. Valproic acid functions through multiple mechanisms, including inhibition of GABA transaminase and blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels, which enhances GABAergic neurotransmission and increases cortical inhibition. The drug is also explored for its anti-proliferative effects in oncology. Metabolism primarily occurs through glucuronidation and mitochondrial β-oxidation, and its bioavailability is high at approximately 90%.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Valproic acid interacts with a variety of molecular targets including numerous sodium channels (SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN3A, and others), suggesting its broad-spectrum activity in managing neuronal excitability. It is also a known inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, etc.), which may explain some of its neuroprotective and mood-stabilizing effects. Enzymatically, it is metabolized by several cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, as well as UGT enzymes like UGT1A6 and UGT2B7, impacting its plasma levels and drug interactions. Valproic acid also interacts with transporters such as SLC22A6 (organic anion transporter) and carriers like ALB (albumin), affecting its disposition in the body.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic aspects of valproic acid are crucial in predicting adverse reactions and treatment efficacy. Notably, polymorphisms in *POLG* (polymerase gamma), such as rs113994095 and rs113994097, have been associated with an increased risk of liver failure and death in patients treated with valproic acid, underscoring the importance of genetic testing prior to therapy initiation. Moreover, variations in the genes encoding for its metabolizing enzymes like *CYP2C9* and *UGT1A6* could influence drug levels and patient response. Although not detailed in the provided data, valproic acid’s interactions with epigenetic regulation through HDAC inhibition suggest a potentially wide-ranging impact on gene expression, which could also have pharmacogenetic implications. Therefore, considering these genetic factors is critical for individualizing therapy with valproic acid to maximize therapeutic benefits while minimizing risks.
