## Drug Summary
Lansoprazole, marketed under various brand names such as Prevacid, is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used primarily to reduce gastric acid secretion. It belongs to the substituted benzimidazole class and is effective in treating conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), active gastric and duodenal ulcers, erosive esophagitis, and conditions caused by excessive acid production like Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Lansoprazole facilitates healing in ulcerative diseases and helps eradicate H. pylori in combination with antibiotics. Structurally, lansoprazole requires activation in an acidic environment and then covalently binds to the H+,K+-ATPase enzyme in parietal cells, leading to long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. It has an oral bioavailability of 80-90% and achieves peak plasma concentration about 1.7 hours post ingestion, although its absorption is decreased when taken with food. Metabolism predominantly occurs in the liver through CYP3A4 and CYP2C19.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Lansoprazole primarily targets the gastric H+,K+-ATPase (ATP4A), inhibiting the enzyme crucial for acid secretion in stomach parietal cells. Additionally, it has been shown to interact with the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), although the clinical relevance of this interaction is not clearly understood. The drug is metabolized mainly by hepatic enzymes including CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, with lesser involvement of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C18, CYP2D6, CYP1A1, and CYP1B1. Lansoprazole interacts with various transporters like ABCG2 (BCRP), ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), and several solute carrier family members (SLC22A1, SLC22A2, SLC22A3, SLC22A8), which can affect its distribution and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
The metabolism of lansoprazole is significantly influenced by genetic variability, particularly involving the CYP2C19 enzyme. Polymorphisms in CYP2C19, such as rs4244285 and rs4986893, lead to reduced enzymatic activity, resulting in decreased metabolism of lansoprazole. This can enhance the drug's efficacy but also increase the risk of side effects in patients with these genotypes. Additionally, variant rs1045642 in the ABCB1 gene has been associated with increased plasma levels of lansoprazole, potentially affecting drug transport and distribution. These pharmacogenetic factors are crucial for tailoring lansoprazole therapy to individual patient profiles to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects.
