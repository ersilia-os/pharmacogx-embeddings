## Drug Summary
Mepivacaine, also known by its brand names Scandicaine, Carbocaine, and Polocaine, is a local anesthetic chemically related to bupivacaine but pharmacologically akin to lidocaine. It is used for local or regional analgesia and anesthesia through local infiltration, peripheral nerve block techniques, and central neural techniques, including epidural and caudal blocks. Notably, Mepivacaine should not be used topically due to its effective topical use requiring large doses. The drug is rapidly absorbed at the local administration site, and its systemic absorption varies based on factors such as the total dose, concentration, and site vascularity. Mepivacaine provides a reasonably rapid onset and a medium duration of anesthesia. Systemic exposure at therapeutic levels typically has minimal effects on cardiovascular and central nervous system parameters.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Mepivacaine exerts its anesthetic action by blocking nerve impulses through its principal target, the sodium channel protein type 10 subunit alpha (SCN10A). It increases the threshold required for electrical excitation in the nerve, slows the propagation of nerve impulses, and decreases the rate of action potential rise, ultimately altering nerve function sequence in clinical settingsâ€”first affecting pain perception, followed by temperature, touch, proprioception, and skeletal muscle tone. There are no specific enzymes, transporters, or carriers detailed in the DrugBank entry, indicating the primary action of Mepivacaine is through its interaction with sodium channels.

## Pharmacogenetics
Though the provided DrugBank information lacks specific details on pharmacogenetics associated with Mepivacaine, the primary action on the SCN10A suggests potential influences by genetic variability in this sodium channel, which could affect drug efficacy and safety. In general, variants in genes encoding for sodium channels may modify a patient's response to local anesthetics. However, specific pharmacogenetic data for Mepivacaine is limited, and further studies or broader clinical genotyping might provide more insights into any substantial genetic influences on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of Mepivacaine in individual patients.
