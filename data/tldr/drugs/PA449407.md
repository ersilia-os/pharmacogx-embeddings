## Drug Summary
Doxazosin, marketed under various names such as Alfadil and Cardura, is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist primarily used to treat symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and hypertension. Approved by the FDA in 1990 and marketed by Pfizer, it acts by relaxing the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, improving urinary flow and lowering blood pressure. Doxazosin achieves peak plasma concentrations within 2-3 hours and has a bioavailability of 60%-70%. It is predominantly metabolized by the liver through the enzymes CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and others, producing inactive metabolites. The drug also exhibits advantageous effects on plasma lipid profiles.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Doxazosin works by selectively inhibiting the alpha-1 subtypes (alpha-1a, alpha-1b, alpha-1d) of adrenergic receptors, located mainly on vascular smooth muscles and the prostate. These actions help reduce peripheral vascular resistance and alleviate symptoms associated with BPH. The primary metabolic processing of doxazosin occurs through cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. It is also a substrate for the transporter proteins ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1) and SLC22A1 (solute carrier family 22 member 1), which may influence its absorption and elimination. No specific carriers for doxazosin were indicated.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors affecting doxazosin treatment primarily involve variations in the metabolizing enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, although specific alleles impacting response or toxicity have not been universally distinguished in clinical settings. Variants in these enzymes might result in altered drug metabolism, potentially influencing drug efficacy and side effects. The transporter protein ABCB1, implicated in drug efflux, also holds pharmacogenetic significance, where genetic variants could modify drug distribution and plasma levels. Although extensive genomic data specific to doxazosin is not provided, these enzyme and transporter interactions with genetic variants represent probable areas for pharmacogenetic influence in drug response variability.
