## Drug Summary
Propranolol, known under various brand names like Angilol, Bedranol SR, and INNOPRAN, is approved for treating several cardiovascular disorders. It prominently functions as a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, meaning it blocks receptors involved in the sympathetic nervous system's responses. Particularly effective in managing hypertension, propranolol also treats conditions such as angina pectoris, atrial fibrillation, migraine prophylaxis, and more. FDA-approved since 1967, propranolol operates with considerable affinity for the beta-adrenergic receptors, with the S(-)-enantiomer possessing about 100 times the binding affinity compared to its counterpart. Pharmacokinetically, it exhibits a Tmax of approximately 2 hours and undergoes extensive metabolism primarily through oxidation and glucuronidation.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Propranolol acts on several beta-adrenergic receptors (ADRB1, ADRB2, ADRB3) to exert its therapeutic effects by inhibiting these receptors, which play a critical role in cardiovascular regulation. The drug also impacts serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR1B), which may explain some of its effects in migraine and psychiatric conditions. Metabolically, propranolol is extensively processed in the liver, involving multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 among others. Additionally, propranolol interactions with transport proteins include SLC22A2 and the drug efflux transporter ABCB1, which could affect its distribution and elimination. It also binds significantly to plasma proteins such as alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (ORM1) and serum albumin (ALB).

## Pharmacogenetics
Regarding pharmacogenetics, variabilities in response and metabolism of propranolol can be primarily attributed to polymorphisms in the cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2D6. CYP2D6, known for its genetic polymorphism, can significantly influence the plasma levels and efficacy of the drug. Poor metabolizers may experience heightened effects or prolonged drug action, whereas extensive metabolizers might require higher doses to achieve therapeutic effects. While there's less direct evidence for CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 variants impacting propranolol metabolism, these enzymes' roles in its biotransformation suggest potential variable interactions. Due to the influence of these genetic factors, tailoring propranolol therapy based on individual genetic makeup may optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects, highlighting the importance of pharmacogenetic testing in clinical settings.
