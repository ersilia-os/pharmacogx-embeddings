## Drug Summary
Folic acid, also known under brand names like Acfol and Fefol, is a synthetic form of folate, a water-soluble B vitamin (Vitamin B9), essential for numerous bodily functions. It plays a crucial role in DNA and RNA synthesis as well as amino acid metabolism, primarily through the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine. Due to its importance in rapidly dividing cells, folic acid supplementation is critical during pregnancy, infancy, and specific medical treatments to prevent deficiencies. It is absorbed rapidly from the small intestine and metabolized primarily in the liver to dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF) by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Folic acid is indicated for the prevention and treatment of folic acid deficiencies and related conditions such as megaloblastic anemia, as well as for reducing homocysteine levels, potentially mitigating cardiovascular risk.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Folic acid interacts with various cellular components for its activation and function. The drug targets include folate receptors like FOLR1 (Folate receptor alpha), FOLR2 (Folate receptor beta), and FOLR3 (Folate receptor gamma), which are pivotal in cellular uptake of the vitamin. Key enzymes involved in its metabolism are DHFR (Dihydrofolate reductase), which converts folic acid into its active forms, MTHFR (Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase), and GGH (Gamma-glutamyl hydrolase). Transporters play a role in the cellular uptake and distribution of folic acid and its metabolites. These include ABCC11, ABCC3, ABCC4, ABCG2 (all members of the ATP-binding cassette family), SLC22A6 (an organic ion transporter), SLC46A1 (a proton-coupled folate transporter), and SLC25A32 (mitochondrial folate transporter/carrier).

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic aspects of folic acid involve primarily the interactions with polymorphic enzymes like DHFR and MTHFR. Variants of the MTHFR gene, such as the C677T and A1298C polymorphisms, can significantly influence folate metabolism and homocysteine levels, affecting cardiovascular disease risk and response to folic acid supplementation. DHFR gene polymorphisms can alter the enzyme's efficiency in reducing folic acid to DHF and THF, impacting drug effectiveness and the risk of adverse reactions when used concomitantly with DHFR inhibitors such as methotrexate. These genetic variations can dictate personalized dosing and preventive strategies, particularly in pregnant women, to avoid neural tube defects or during treatment with antifolate drugs to optimize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing toxicity.
