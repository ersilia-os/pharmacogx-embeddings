## Drug Summary
Bezafibrate, also known by trade names such as Befizal, Bezalip, and Cedur, belongs to the class of antilipemic agents. It is primarily used for treating various types of primary and secondary hyperlipidemias, particularly when dietary or lifestyle changes are insufficient. Pharmacodynamically, bezafibrate acts to lower cholesterol and triglycerides, promote an increase in high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and reduce low-density lipoproteins (LDL) by enhancing the activity of triglyceride lipases which are crucial for the catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. It also reduces cholesterol biosynthesis, increases LDL-receptor activity, and has beneficial effects on thrombogenic factors and blood glucose levels in diabetic patients. Bezafibrate shows excellent oral absorption and undergoes hepatic metabolism.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Bezafibrate has multiple molecular targets, notably peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), including PPAR-alpha (PPARA), PPAR-gamma (PPARG), and PPAR-delta (PPARD). Inhibition and modulation of these receptors influence lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis. Additionally, it interacts with the nuclear receptors RXRA, RXRB, and RXRG, potentially affecting various metabolic pathways through gene expression regulation. The list of enzymes involved in its metabolism includes CYP1A1, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4, highlighting significant hepatic involvement and potential drug-drug interaction implications. Bezafibrate is also transported by SLCO1B1, which could influence its pharmacokinetics and disposition.

## Pharmacogenetics
Bezafibrate's effectiveness and safety may vary based on genetic factors. Its interaction with genetic variants of PPARs (PPARA, PPARG, PPARD) could affect individual responses to the drug, impacting its effectiveness in lipid regulation and glucose metabolism. Since it is metabolized by enzymes such as CYP1A1, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4, genetic variations in these cytochrome P450 enzymes could lead to differences in drug metabolism, affecting both efficacy and risk of adverse effects. Genes encoding the transporter SLCO1B1 are also crucial, as variants could influence the pharmacokinetics of bezafibrate. However, detailed pharmacogenetic data specific to bezafibrate is not extensively documented and would benefit from further research to optimize treatment outcomes based on individual genetic profiles.
