## Drug Summary
Sibutramine, also known under trade names such as Meridia, Reductil, Butramin, and Medaria, is an oral medication previously used for the management of obesity. Structurally similar to amphetamines, it acts as a centrally acting stimulant and is categorized as a Schedule IV controlled substance in the United States. Following reports suggesting increased risks of heart attack and stroke, especially among patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, sibutramine was withdrawn from the US and Canadian markets in 2010. The drug primarily works by inhibiting the reuptake of neurotransmitters serotonin, norepinephrine, and to a lesser extent, dopamine, which increases satiety and reduces food intake. Moreover, it is rapidly absorbed with an unknown absolute bioavailability but has a significant hepatic metabolism.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Sibutramine exerts its action primarily through its metabolites M1 and M2, which effectively inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine at the neuronal synapse. Its interaction involves specific targets like the sodium-dependent dopamine transporter (SLC6A3), serotonin transporter (SLC6A4), and noradrenaline transporter (SLC6A2). These transporters play a critical role in the modulation of the synaptic concentrations of their respective neurotransmitters, influencing mood and satiety. The primary enzyme involved in its metabolism is Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), crucial for the biotransformation of sibutramine into its active metabolites. No specific transporters or carriers beyond these are indicated in the DrugBank data provided.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic data on sibutramine includes insights into genetic variants that may influence its efficacy. Specifically, the genotype linked with the GNB3 gene (rs5443) is reported to influence weight loss outcomes in patients undergoing treatment with sibutramine. Patients carrying certain alleles of this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) may experience differential effects in terms of weight loss efficacy. This gene variant could be used as a potential biomarker for predicting patient response to sibutramine treatment, although its clinical utility and broader implications require further validation and study. Such pharmacogenetic insights are crucial for understanding individual variability in drug response, potentially guiding personalized treatment approaches in obesity management despite the drug's market withdrawal.
