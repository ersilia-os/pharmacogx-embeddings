## Drug Summary
Tepotinib, marketed under the name Tepmetko, is a selective MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor used for treating metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with MET exon 14 skipping alterations. It inhibits the MET receptor tyrosine kinase, which is often mutated or overexpressed in various tumor types including NSCLC, contributing to aggressive cancer progression. Tepotinib was first approved in Japan in March 2020 and later by the US FDA in February 2021 for this indication. The drug is taken orally and is noted for its once-daily dosing convenience, a significant advantage in cancer treatment regimes, enhancing patient compliance. It exhibits an absolute bioavailability of approximately 72%, with peak plasma concentrations reached about 8 hours post-administration. Tepotinib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C8.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Tepotinib acts predominantly by inhibiting the MET kinase, vital for various cellular processes such as growth, survival, and metastasis in cancer cells. In addition to MET, it modestly targets Nischarin (NISCH) and the Melatonin receptor type 1B (MTNR1B), though their roles in tepotinib's anti-cancer effects are less defined. The drug is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2C8, with CYP2C9 also playing a role in its metabolic pathway. Transporters including P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2), and various solute carriers (SLC22A1, SLC22A2, SLC47A1, SLC47A2, ABCB11) are involved in its disposition. Tepotinib also interacts with proteins such as Serum albumin (ALB) and Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1), which may affect its distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
The efficacy and safety of tepotinib are influenced by genetic variations in the MET gene, particularly the exon 14 skipping alterations, making it a target for genetically driven therapy in NSCLC. Additionally, variations in metabolizing enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 could potentially alter tepotinib pharmacokinetics, affecting both its efficacy and toxicity profile. For example, polymorphisms in CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 might result in slower metabolism and increased exposure to tepotinib, potentially leading to an increased risk of adverse effects such as interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis. Although specific pharmacogenomic data from the genomic database are not detailed here, studies and clinical observations suggest that genetic screening for MET alterations is crucial before initiating therapy with tepotinib, and further pharmacogenetic testing might be beneficial to optimize patient outcomes.
