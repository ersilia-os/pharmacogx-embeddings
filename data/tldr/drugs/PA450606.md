## Drug Summary
Nelfinavir is an antiretroviral medication primarily used for the management of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. It belongs to the protease inhibitor class, which plays a critical role in inhibiting the HIV-1 protease enzyme. This enzyme is necessary for the proteolytic cleavage of the viral polyprotein precursors into individual functional proteins that are essential for the production of infectious HIV-1 particles. Nelfinavir binds to the active site of this enzyme, preventing it from processing the polyprotein, which results in the formation of immature, non-infectious viral particles. It is commonly used in combination with other antiviral drugs to enhance therapeutic efficacy. The drug is well absorbed after oral administration and undergoes metabolism primarily mediated by cytochrome P-450 enzymes, with CYP3A being predominantly involved.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Nelfinavir specifically targets the HIV-1 protease, inhibiting its function which is crucial for the maturation of the virus. The drug is metabolized in the liver primarily by enzymes of the cytochrome P450 family, including CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and also involves UGT1A1 (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase). Nelfinavir interacts with multiple transporters which influence its distribution and elimination, including ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), SLC22A1, SLCO1A2, SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, SLCO2B1, ABCG2, and ABCB11. Additionally, serum albumin (ALB) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1) act as carriers that bind to the drug, potentially affecting its bioavailability and plasma concentration.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacokinetics and effects of nelfinavir may vary significantly between individuals due to genetic differences in the enzymes responsible for its metabolism, particularly the CYP3A and CYP2C19 isoforms. Variants in the genes encoding these enzymes can lead to different rates of drug metabolism, influencing both the efficacy and toxicity of nelfinavir. For instance, individuals with certain polymorphisms in the CYP3A5 gene may have altered enzyme activity, impacting the drugâ€™s metabolism and thus requiring dosage adjustments. Similarly, genetic variability in efflux transporters like ABCB1 may affect drug disposition and resistance profiles. These pharmacogenetic factors are important considerations for personalized medicine approaches in HIV treatment, ensuring optimal dosing and minimizing adverse effects. Genetic testing for these variants might be advised to tailor treatment strategies effectively.
