## Drug Summary
Doxorubicin, also known as Adriablastina or Adriblastin, is a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic used in cancer treatment. It disrupts DNA structures through intercalation and inhibits topoisomerase II, a key enzyme in DNA replication. This mechanism leads to DNA damage and apoptosis in cancer cells. Additionally, doxorubicin generates reactive oxygen species which contribute substantially to its cytotoxic effects but also to its significant side effect of cardiotoxicity. It has multiple indications for various cancers such as breast, ovarian, and various hematologic malignancies. The drug is administered via intravenous route, and its metabolism occurs primarily via one-electron and two-electron reductions and deglycosidation, with a significant portion eliminated unchanged.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Doxorubicin acts mainly on DNA topoisomerases (TOP2A and TOP2B) and also affects other molecular targets including NOLC1 and TOP1, impacting the DNA replication and repair mechanisms. In terms of metabolism, it involves several enzymes such as AKR1A1, AKR1B1, CYP3A4, and NQO1. Doxorubicin's pharmacokinetics are also influenced by various transporters including ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) and ABCC1, which can affect drug efflux from cells, modifying its efficacy and toxicity. Albumin (ALB) acts as a carrier, influencing its distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
Doxorubicin's pharmacogenetic profiles highlight interactions with several genes that influence its toxicity and effectiveness, with particular concern for cardiotoxicity. Notable genetic markers include polymorphisms in RARG, SLC28A3, and UGT1A6, where certain genotypes in pediatric patients significantly correlate with an increased risk of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. These pharmacogenetic insights are crucial for tailoring doxorubicin therapy to reduce adverse effects and enhance therapeutic outcomes, particularly in populations with genetic susceptibilities.
