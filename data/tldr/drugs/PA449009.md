## Drug Summary
Ciprofloxacin, known under various brand names such as Bacquinor, Baycip, and Ciproxin, is a second-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic. It has broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and is effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The mechanism of ciprofloxacin involves the inhibition of bacterial enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are crucial for bacterial DNA replication. This antibiotic is well-absorbed orally, with a bioavailability of approximately 70-80%, and metabolized primarily by the CYP1A2 enzyme. It is effective for the treatment of various infections including urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, and skin infections. Ciprofloxacin has also been used to treat severe infections like anthrax and plague.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Ciprofloxacin targets bacterial enzymes such as DNA gyrase (gyrA gene in various species like Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli) and topoisomerase IV (encoded by the parC and parE genes in various bacteria), crucial for bacterial DNA synthesis and maintenance. It also shows activity against human DNA topoisomerase 2-alpha and potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2, suggesting potential wider biological effects. The drug is metabolized predominantly by cytochrome P450 enzymes, notably CYP1A2, and also involves CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7. Transporters associated with ciprofloxacin include ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1) and SLC47 family proteins, which may affect drug disposition. Its interaction with serum albumin (ALB) may be relevant for its distribution and pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors in ciprofloxacin therapy include the involvement of the CYP1A2 enzyme in its metabolism, which may influence drug levels and effects based on individual genetic variations in CYP1A2 activity. Polymorphisms in these genes can result in varied enzyme activity leading to differences in drug metabolism speed, which can affect both efficacy and toxicity of ciprofloxacin. Variants in drug transporters such as ABCB1 might also modify the drug's absorption and distribution, potentially altering its effectiveness and safety profile. There is currently limited data explicitly linking specific genomic variations to clinical outcomes in ciprofloxacin treatment, but genotyping may be considered in cases of unusual responses or adverse effects in patients.
