## Drug Summary
Encorafenib, marketed as BRAFTOVI, is a selective inhibitor of the BRAF kinase, particularly targeting the BRAF V600E mutation. This mutation leads to an aberrant activation of the MAP kinase/ERK signaling pathway, promoting cell proliferation and survival. Encorafenib is used predominantly in the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and colorectal cancer (CRC) with this specific mutation. The drug shows dose-proportional pharmacokinetics with oral administration, achieving steady-state within 15 days. Metabolism of encorafenib predominantly involves CYP3A4, with minor contributions from CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. It exhibits a distinct pharmacodynamic profile compared to other BRAF inhibitors and is generally administered in combination with other therapeutics like binimetinib and cetuximab to enhance efficacy and overcome resistance.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Encorafenib targets multiple kinases including BRAF V600E, wild-type BRAF, CRAF, JNK1, JNK2, JNK3, LIMK1, LIMK2, MEK4, STK36. These targets are involved in various signaling pathways that regulate tumoral growth and cell proliferation. Important enzymes for its metabolism include CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. Encorafenib is also associated with several transporters like ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), ABCG2, SLC22A2, and SLCO1B1 which may influence its absorption and distribution. Moreover, it is significantly bound to serum albumin (ALB), which can affect its pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of encorafenib revolves largely around the BRAF V600E mutation, which is a primary predictor for the therapeutic efficacy of encorafenib. Patients harboring this mutation are prime candidates for encorafenib treatment. The metabolism of encorafenib by CYP3A4 suggests that variations in this enzyme, commonly affected by polymorphisms, could influence encorafenib's plasma levels and side effects, although specific allelic variations impacting metabolism have not been detailed here. Additionally, given the involvement of transporters like ABCB1 and ABCG2, genetic variants in these genes could also potentially affect the drugâ€™s pharmacokinetics and response. Such interactions, however, require further clinical validation to confirm their significance in the context of encorafenib treatment.
