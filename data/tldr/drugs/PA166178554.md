## Drug Summary
(S)-methadone, more commonly referred to simply as methadone, is a synthetic opioid used primarily for opioid maintenance therapy in opioid dependence and for chronic pain management. Methadone acts as a mu-opioid receptor agonist. Its efficacy in treatment of opioid dependence lies in its pharmacokinetic properties; it has a slow onset and a long half-life, typically ranging from 8 to 59 hours, which helps in reducing the frequency of dosing and in minimizing the euphoria associated with opioids, thus lowering the risk of addiction. Methadone is metabolized primarily in the liver primarily by the CYP3A4, CYP2B6, and CYP2D6 enzymes and is excreted mainly in urine.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Methadone primarily targets the mu-opioid receptor (MOR), where it acts as an agonist. This action on the opioid receptors results in the analgesic, sedative, and euphoric effects associated with its use. Regarding its metabolism, the key enzymes involved include CYP3A4, CYP2B6, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are critical for the oxidative metabolism of methadone, affecting its plasma levels and duration of action. There are no major specific transporters or carriers uniquely affecting methadone's pharmacokinetics that are noted beyond those that generally impact many drugs metabolized by the liver.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors are important in understanding the variability of methadone metabolism and response among individuals. Variants in the CYP2B6 and CYP2D6 genes can significantly influence methadone's plasma levels and the overall therapeutic outcome. For instance, CYP2B6 poor metabolizers may experience higher plasma levels of methadone, resulting in prolonged drug action and a potential increase in adverse effects. Similarly, CYP2D6 poor metabolizers may also exhibit differences in the metabolism of methadone. This variability can impact dosing requirements and risk of toxicity. Hence, genetic testing might inform personalized methadone therapy, potentially enhancing its efficacy and safety in opioid dependence treatment and pain management.
