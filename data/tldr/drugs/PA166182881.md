## Drug Summary
Migalastat, also marketed under the brand name Amigal, is an oral medication specifically approved for adults with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease harboring amenable mutations in the alpha-galactosidase A (GLA) gene. Fabry disease is a rare, progressive genetic disorder resulting from GLA mutations that lead to deficient activity of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A, crucial for breaking down glycosphingolipids. Accumulation of these substrates in various body organs causes significant morbidity and mortality. Migalastat acts as a pharmacological chaperone by stabilizing the defective enzyme, thereby enhancing its function and reducing substrate accumulation. This drug was granted accelerated and orphan drug approvals due to its significant potential benefits in a condition with limited treatment options.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Migalastat directly targets alpha-galactosidase A, an enzyme whose genetic mutations result in Fabry disease. By binding to this enzyme, migalastat facilitates its proper folding and transport to the lysosomes, where it can function effectively to degrade glycosphingolipids. The stability of this interaction is pH-dependent, with disassociation occurring in the acidic environment of the lysosome, which allows the enzyme to function normally. Additionally, migalastat absorption involves the sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 (SLC5A1), significant for its intestinal uptake. There are no specific carriers or other enzymes involved in its significant metabolic pathways, as migalastat's metabolism primarily involves minor glucuronidation.

## Pharmacogenetics
The effectiveness of migalastat hinges crucially on the presence of specific GLA gene mutations termed "amenable variants." Variants that are responsive to treatment with migalastat lead to the production of a partially functional, misfolded alpha-galactosidase A enzyme. The drug's mechanism, that of a pharmacological chaperone, is contingent upon these particular genetic alterations which allow the stabilization and functional correction of the enzyme in a way that is not feasible with other genetic variants. The selection of patients for therapy is based on in vitro assays determining the amenability of their GLA mutations. This pharmacogenetic tailoring ensures that the drug is administered only to those likely to benefit, illustrating a targeted approach in the treatment of genetic diseases. Further pharmacogenetic research may expand the list of amenable mutations or enhance our understanding of the drug's interaction with various genetic backgrounds.
