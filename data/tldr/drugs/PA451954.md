## Drug Summary
Zidovudine, also known as AZT, is an antiretroviral medication used in the treatment of HIV infections, often in combination with other drugs. As a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), it targets the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase enzyme, thereby inhibiting viral replication. Structurally similar to thymidine, zidovudine is a prodrug which gets phosphorylated to its active form, zidovudine triphosphate (ZDV-TP), to competitively inhibit and terminate DNA synthesis. The drug is absorbed rapidly from the gastrointestinal tract with variable bioavailability due to first-pass metabolism. Its metabolism primarily occurs in the liver, predominantly via glucuronidation by UGT2B7, forming an inactive metabolite. Notably, zidovudine can also inhibit cellular DNA polymerases to a lesser extent, which contributes to some of its toxicities like bone marrow suppression.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Zidovudine acts primarily on the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (pol) by incorporating itself into the viral DNA and halting its elongation. It is metabolized mainly by UGT2B7 and, to a lesser extent, UGT1A1, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4. Important transporters involved in its pharmacokinetics include SLC22A2, SLC22A6, SLC22A7, SLC22A8, SLC22A11 for organic cation transport, and SLC28A1 and SLC29A2 specific for nucleoside transport. The drug is also a substrate for efflux transporters such as ABCB1, ABCC4, ABCC5, and ABCG2, which may influence its distribution and elimination. Additionally, zidovudine binds to serum albumin (ALB), which can affect its pharmacokinetics by altering its free concentration in the blood.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of zidovudine focuses mainly on the variability in metabolism and transport processes that affect drug exposure and toxicity. Variants in the UGT2B7 gene can influence the glucuronidation efficiency of zidovudine, impacting both its effectiveness and safety profile. Individuals with certain UGT2B7 haplotypes may exhibit altered drug metabolism, leading to differences in drug levels and potential toxicities. Similarly, polymorphisms in CYP450 enzymes like CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, although less significant for zidovudine compared to other antiretrovirals, might still affect its minor metabolic pathways. Genetic variations in transporter genes such as ABCB1 and SLC22A1 could also modify the drug's absorption, distribution, and elimination, thereby modifying efficacy and adverse effect profiles. Additionally, genetic factors influencing bone marrow sensitivity and recovery, crucial for managing zidovudine-induced myelosuppression, may be of clinical importance, although specific gene associations need further validation.
