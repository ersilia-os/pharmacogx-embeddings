## Drug Summary
Ivacaftor, marketed as Kalydeco and as part of combination therapies under names such as Orkambi (with lumacaftor), Symdeko (with tezacaftor), and Trikafta (with tezacaftor and elexacaftor), is a therapeutic agent indicated for managing cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients with specific mutations in the CFTR gene. Approved by the FDA in 2012, ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator, enhancing the functionality of the CFTR protein, which plays a crucial role in chloride and sodium ion transport across cell membranes. The drug is particularly effective in CF patients with gating mutations where the CFTR protein is present but functions improperly. Ivacaftor's administration leads to improved lung function, reduced symptoms, and better quality of life for patients. It is metabolized primarily by CYP3A enzymes, and its absorption is increased when taken with fat-containing foods.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Ivacaftor targets the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein, enhancing its chloride transport function, which is crucial in managing the CF disease mechanism. It's metabolized predominantly by the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9. Ivacaftor is also linked with transporters such as the P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), which can affect its distribution and excretion. Additionally, serum proteins like albumin (ALB) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1) serve as carriers that may influence its systemic concentration and distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
Ivacaftor’s efficacy is primarily dependent on the genetic mutations present in the CFTR gene of CF patients. It is specifically beneficial in patients with gating mutations — mutations that impair the gating function of the CFTR protein while allowing normal protein expression on the cell surface. The pharmacogenetic profile of the patient is critical for ivacaftor's efficacy, as specific mutations like G551D among others provide a significant positive response to the treatment. Genetic tests are often required before initiation of treatment to confirm the presence of ivacaftor-responsive CFTR mutations. Moreover, polymorphisms in metabolizing enzymes, particularly CYP3A variants, could influentially alter ivacaftor's metabolism, impacting both the efficacy and safety of the drug in individual patients.
