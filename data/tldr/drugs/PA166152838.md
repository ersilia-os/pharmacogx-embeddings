## Drug Summary
Dimethyl fumarate, marketed under the brand name Tecfidera, is an oral medication approved by the FDA for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease. This drug was the third oral disease-modifying agent for MS following fingolimod and teriflunomide. Initially used in Germany to treat psoriasis, dimethyl fumarate acts through its main active metabolite, monomethyl fumarate (MMF), which is thought to up-regulate the Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) pathway, in response to oxidative stress and to inhibit nuclear factor kappa B, thus suppressing pro-inflammatory genes. Absorption of dimethyl fumarate leads to rapid conversion to MMF by esterases, with peak serum concentration achieved within 2 to 2.5 hours post-ingestion. The drug’s metabolism primarily occurs via the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and it is not significantly metabolized by the Cytochrome P450 system.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Dimethyl fumarate targets multiple pathways and molecules; particularly, it interacts with Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) and Transcription factor p65 (RELA). KEAP1 interaction purportedly facilitates the activation of the Nrf2 pathway—a critical regulator of cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative stress. RELA, part of the NF-κB complex, plays a role in immune response, and its inhibition by dimethyl fumarate likely contributes to the drug’s anti-inflammatory effects. There are no specific enzymes, transporters, or carriers identified in the metabolism or action of dimethyl fumarate, indicating the drug's metabolism and effects may depend largely on ubiquitous cellular components like esterases and general metabolic pathways rather than specialized drug-metabolizing enzymes.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is currently limited explicit pharmacogenetic data available on dimethyl fumarate. Given the pathways it interacts with, genetic variants in genes related to the Nrf2 pathway and immune response regulation such as KEAP1 and genes involved in the NF-κB signaling might influence the drug's efficacy and safety profile. However, no specific associations with clinical outcomes in dimethyl fumarate treatment have been robustly validated. Further research might elucidate the role of genetic variations within the MET gene or canonical inflammation pathways that could predict patient response or risk of adverse effects. Since dimethyl fumarate does not rely on major drug-metabolizing enzymes like CYP450s for its clearance, typical pharmacogenomic interactions through these pathways are unlikely.
