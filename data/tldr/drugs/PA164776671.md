## Drug Summary
Cinacalcet, marketed under the names Sensipar® and Mimpara®, is a calcimimetic drug primarily used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, and hypercalcemia in patients with parathyroid carcinoma. As a calcimimetic agent, cinacalcet mimics the action of calcium on tissues which helps manage elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and associated calcium and phosphorus metabolism disorders. Cinacalcet's efficacy includes reducing PTH levels and consequently lowering serum calcium levels. This drug is rapidly absorbed upon oral administration, and is metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2 enzymes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Cinacalcet acts on the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CASR), which is critical for regulating parathyroid hormone secretion in response to changing serum calcium levels. By increasing the sensitivity of CASR, cinacalcet effectively reduces PTH secretion and manages the serum calcium concentration. Metabolically, cinacalcet is extensively processed in the liver with cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2 playing dominant roles. These enzymes facilitate oxidative reactions leading to the formation of various metabolites, which are further processed and excreted. No specific transporters or carriers are directly involved with cinacalcet's pharmacokinetics according to the provided data.

## Pharmacogenetics
Cinacalcet's interaction with the enzymes CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2 suggests significant pharmacogenetic implications. Genetic variations in these cytochrome P450 enzymes can influence the drug's metabolism and consequently its efficacy and toxicity. For example, polymorphisms in CYP2D6 can range from poor to ultra-rapid metabolism, affecting drug levels and response. Patients with poor metabolizer status may experience increased exposure to cinacalcet, potentially leading to more pronounced effects or increased risk of adverse reactions such as hypocalcemia. In contrast, ultra-rapid metabolizers might require higher doses to achieve therapeutic effects. These pharmacogenetic considerations are crucial for individualizing dosing and optimizing therapeutic outcomes in patients treated with cinacalcet.
