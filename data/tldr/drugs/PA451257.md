## Drug Summary
Risperidone is a second-generation antipsychotic primarily used to manage mood and mental health disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and irritability associated with autistic disorder. Notably effective for both mood stabilization and psychotic features, risperidone has a high oral bioavailability of 70% and is predominantly metabolized in the liver, with paliperidone being its main active metabolite. The drug operates by reconciling excessive dopaminergic and serotonergic activity implicated in psychiatric disorders. It's particularly distinguished by a higher affinity to serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors compared to dopaminergic D2 receptors, aiding in its efficacy and tolerability profile regarding lower extrapyramidal side effects compared to first-generation antipsychotics.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Risperidone exerts its antipsychotic action mainly through antagonism of the 5-HT2A and D2 receptors. Additionally, it impacts several other neurotransmitter systems; it antagonizes receptors like adrenergic alpha-1 (ADRA1B, ADRA1A), alpha-2 (ADRA2B, ADRA2C), as well as multiple subtypes of 5-HT receptors (HTR2C, HTR1D, HTR1A, HTR7) and histamine H1 (HRH1) receptors. This varied receptor activity contributes to its effectiveness and side effect profile. Metabolism is extensively governed by cytochrome P450 enzymes, primarily CYP2D6 and also CYP3A4, and risperidoneâ€™s interactions with ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) impact its distribution. Albumin (ALB) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1) serve as its carriers, influencing its pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
The metabolic processing of risperidone is notably influenced by the genetic polymorphisms within the CYP2D6 enzyme, which catalyzes its conversion to paliperidone. Individuals with different CYP2D6 alleles might experience variations in risperidone efficacy and toxicity, leading to differing responses. For instance, poor metabolizers (decreased function of CYP2D6) could have higher plasma concentrations of risperidone, increasing the risk of adverse effects, while extensive or ultra-rapid metabolizers might process the drug too quickly, potentially reducing its efficacy. Thus, genotyping can be considered to refine individual dosing strategies, especially in treatment-resistant or sensitive cases, aligning with recent trends towards more personalized psychiatric care.
