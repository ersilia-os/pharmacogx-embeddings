## Drug Summary
Bepridil, known under brand names such as Angopril, Cordium, and Vascor, is a long-acting calcium channel blocker used primarily for the treatment of hypertension and chronic stable angina. Unlike other calcium channel blockers like nifedipine, verapamil, or diltiazem, bepridil is not chemically related to them and exhibits unique pharmacodynamics properties. It acts by inhibiting both the slow calcium (L-type) and fast sodium inward currents in myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cells, and also interferes with the calcium binding to calmodulin. Bepridil has been shown to reduce heart rate and arterial pressure effectively. However, it is no longer marketed in the United States due to its association with ventricular arrhythmias, specifically Torsades de Pointes. The drug is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration and undergoes metabolism primarily in the liver.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Bepridil affects a variety of targets involved in cardiac and smooth muscle function. It interacts with several voltage-dependent calcium channels including CACNA1A (P/Q-type), CACNA1H (T-type), and CACNA2D2 (alpha-2/delta-2 subunit), which are integral in regulating calcium influx critical for muscle contraction and conductance. Additionally, it influences the sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit alpha-1 (ATP1A1), potassium channels such as KCNQ1 and KCNH2, and proteins involved in calcium signaling like calmodulin (CALM1) and troponin C (TNNC1). It also inhibits specific phosphodiesterases (PDE1A, PDE1B), which play roles in signal transduction pathways. The hepatic metabolism of bepridil involves major enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. The drug is also a substrate of the transporter ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), affecting its pharmacokinetic behavior including absorption and clearance.

## Pharmacogenetics
Bepridil's pharmacogenetic profile might be influenced primarily by the genetic variability in the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are responsible for its metabolism. Variants in these genes can lead to differences in enzyme activity ranging from poor to ultra-rapid metabolism, thus potentially affecting the drugâ€™s efficacy and risk of toxicity. For instance, individuals with reduced function alleles of CYP2D6 might experience higher concentrations of bepridil, increasing the risk for adverse effects like arrhythmias. Conversely, those with multiple copies of CYP2D6 or enhanced function alleles of CYP3A4 could have lower drug levels, possibly reducing therapeutic effects. Furthermore, genetic variations in ABCB1 might impact the pharmacokinetics of bepridil, influencing drug absorption and disposition. Nevertheless, specific pharmacogenetic guidelines for bepridil are not well-established in clinical settings, indicating a need for more personalized approaches and further research in this area.
