## Drug Summary
Tioguanine, also known as thioguanine, belongs to the class of medications known as antineoplastic anti-metabolites. It is primarily used in the treatment of acute nonlymphocytic leukemias. As an anti-metabolite, tioguanine interferes with DNA and RNA synthesis by mimicking natural purine nucleotides, thereby inhibiting cell growth and division. Tioguanine's therapeutic actions result from its competitive inhibition of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, followed by its conversion to active metabolites that are incorporated into DNA and RNA, disrupting cellular functions and inducing cytotoxicity. The absorption of tioguanine is relatively poor and variable, with oral bioavailability averaging about 30%. Metabolism occurs in the liver, where tioguanine is converted into its nucleotide forms, which are crucial for its action.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Tioguanine acts primarily through the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT1), critical for its activation and incorporation into nucleic acids. The drug's metabolic pathway also involves other unspecific enzymes that convert the active metabolite 6-thioguanilyic acid (TGMP) further into its di- and tri-phosphate forms (TGDP and TGTP). Additionally, tioguanine and its metabolites are substrates for the transporter ABCC4 (multidrug resistance-associated protein 4), which plays a role in cellular efflux of these compounds, potentially affecting drug levels and efficacy.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors significantly influence the efficacy and safety of tioguanine. Variability in the thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) enzyme, which is involved in the metabolism of thiopurine drugs, affects tioguanine's toxicity profile. Several polymorphisms in TPMT, such as rs1800460, rs1142345, rs1800462, and rs1800584, are associated with increased risks of adverse effects like rapid bone marrow suppression. Individuals with certain TPMT genotypes may experience severe toxicity due to slower metabolism of the drug, leading to higher systemic levels of active metabolites. Testing for TPMT genetic variants is recommended before initiating therapy to tailor the dose and regimen appropriately, thereby minimizing toxicity while maximizing therapeutic outcomes.
