## Drug Summary
Trimipramine, known under various brand names such as Herphonal, Sapilent, Stangyl, and others, is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) primarily indicated for the treatment of depression, particularly when accompanied by anxiety, agitation, or sleep disturbances. It possesses antihistaminic and sedative properties, distinguishing it from other TCAs like imipramine. Its pharmacological efficacy is initially believed to stem from the inhibition of norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake, but the mood-elevating effects are now considered related to changes in receptor sensitivity in specific brain regions. Trimipramine is also noted for its analgesic effects on various types of pain, including neuropathic pain, and is utilized in migraine prophylaxis. The drug is quickly absorbed when administered, and its metabolism primarily occurs in the liver.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Trimipramine works by affecting multiple targets including sodium-dependent serotonin (SLC6A4), noradrenaline (SLC6A2), and dopamine (SLC6A3) transporters which facilitate the reuptake of these neurotransmitters. It also interacts with various receptors like the alpha-1A and alpha-1B adrenergic receptors (ADRA1A, ADRA1B), multiple subtypes of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors (HTR2A, HTR1A, etc.), beta-adrenergic receptors (ADRB), as well as muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM). Trimipramine's primary metabolizing enzymes are CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP2C19. The drug is also a substrate of the ABCB1 transporter, a crucial component influencing its distribution and elimination.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors significantly influence trimipramine's metabolism, particularly variations in CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 enzymes. Key polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 gene, such as rs35742686, rs3892097, and rs1135824, are noted for their role in conferring poor metabolism of trimipramine, potentially leading to enhanced adverse effects or increased drug accumulation. Similarly, variations in CYP2C19, including rs4244285 and rs4986893, are associated with reduced metabolic activity, impacting drug efficacy and safety profiles. These genetic variants necessitate consideration for dose adjustments and could guide decisions on the use of trimipramine relative to other antidepressants, particularly in personalized medicine settings.
