## Drug Summary
Tolperisone, also known under the brand names Musclex and Viveo, is a centrally acting muscle relaxant used primarily for the treatment of neurologic disorders, spinal cord injuries, muscle spasms, back pain, and multiple sclerosis. Although the complete mechanism of action of Tolperisone is not fully understood, it is known to inhibit both sodium and calcium channels. It has a high affinity for nervous system tissues, particularly the brain stem, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. Notably, Tolperisone does not produce sedative effects and does not show interactions with alcohol, distinguishing it from some other muscle relaxants.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Tolperisone primarily acts on the central nervous system tissue but specific molecular targets such as receptors or enzymes beyond its ion channel blockade are not well delineated in the available data. However, it is metabolized in the liver, with CYP1A2 being a significant enzyme responsible for this process. Lack of detailed information on specific transporters and carriers suggests that these aspects of Tolperisone's pharmacokinetics might either be insignificant or understudied.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors involving Tolperisone are primarily linked to the CYP1A2 enzyme, which is involved in its metabolism. Variations in the CYP1A2 gene can influence the metabolic rate of the drug, potentially affecting both efficacy and the risk of adverse effects. Individuals with certain genetic polymorphisms in CYP1A2 may exhibit different rates of metabolism, thus requiring adjustments in dosing. However, specific genotype-to-phenotype correlations in the context of Tolperisone use require further clarification through clinical and pharmacogenetic studies.
