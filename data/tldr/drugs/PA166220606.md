## Drug Summary
Bazedoxifene, also marketed under the name Viviant, is a third-generation selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). It was developed by Pfizer and is utilized in monotherapy or combined with conjugated estrogens primarily for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause and the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women. Bazedoxifene operates as an estrogen-receptor agonist or antagonist depending on the target tissue, particularly functioning as an antagonist in uterine and breast tissues. It effectively decreases bone resorption and increases bone mineral density (BMD), thereby reducing fracture risk. The drug is characterized by a low bioavailability (∼6%), rapid absorption (tmax ∼2 hours), and its major metabolic pathway is glucuronidation, involving little to no cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Bazedoxifene targets two primary estrogen receptors: Estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and Estrogen receptor beta (ESR2). These receptors are pivotal in their differential roles across tissues, where ESR1 has extensive implications in reproductive tissues and bone, while ESR2 has roles in the cardiovascular system and CNS. The metabolism of Bazedoxifene primarily involves glucuronidation by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), specifically UGT1A4, UGT1A8, and UGT1A10. These enzymes catalyze the conjugation and subsequent elimination of bazedoxifene. There is no significant interaction with drug transporters or carriers reported for Bazedoxifene.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is limited specific information regarding the pharmacogenetic aspects of Bazedoxifene. However, due to its metabolism largely involving UGT enzymes such as UGT1A4, UGT1A8, and UGT1A10, genetic variability in these genes might influence the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of the drug. Variants in UGT genes have been associated with differing levels of activity, which could affect the metabolism rate of Bazedoxifene and thus its efficacy and safety profile. Further genomic data and studies would be required to establish concrete pharmacogenetic associations and their clinical implications, but these potential interactions suggest a need for personalized dosing in populations with variant UGT alleles to optimize therapeutic efficacy and reduce adverse events.
