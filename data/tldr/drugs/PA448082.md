## Drug Summary
Alendronic acid, commonly known under numerous brand names such as Fosamax, Beenos, and Ostemax, is a second-generation bisphosphonate primarily used to treat and prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men, as well as to manage Paget's disease of bone and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. It operates by preventing bone resorption, which is crucial for maintaining bone density. Alendronic acid is known for its very low oral bioavailability, which can be affected by food intake. It primarily distributes into bone and soft tissues after administration and is excreted through urine without undergoing metabolic transformation. Intriguingly, alendronic acid does not appear in the metabolized form in the urine, suggesting it is excreted unchanged.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Alendronic acid's mode of action is primarily through binding to hydroxyapatite found in the bone matrix. This binding facilitates the drug's uptake by osteoclasts (the cells responsible for bone resorption), leading to their apoptosis and, consequently, a reduction in bone resorption. Key targets of alendronic acid include several protein phosphatases such as Farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FDPS), Tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 4 (PTPN4), Receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase S (PTPRS), and Receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase epsilon (PTPRE), as well as V-type proton ATPase catalytic subunit A (ATP6V1A). These targets contribute to its efficacy in decreasing urinary calcium along with markers of bone turnover such as deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptidases of type I collagen.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, detailed pharmacogenetic data specific to alendronic acid are not extensively documented in the literature or databases like PharmGKB or within the FDA's genomic data. However, given the drug's specific interaction with bone tissue, genetic variations in genes related to bone density and health (such as those affecting calcium and phosphate homeostasis) might influence patient responses to alendronic acid. Future research might elucidate specific genetic markers that could predict responsiveness or risk of adverse effects to alendronic acid, enhancing personalized treatment approaches in bone-related diseases. Despite the current lack of concrete pharmacogenetic guidelines for alendronic acid, its well-characterized pharmacodynamic properties and effect on bone resorption markers provide a basis for continual research in this area.
