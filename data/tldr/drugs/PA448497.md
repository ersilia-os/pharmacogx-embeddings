## Drug Summary
Acetylsalicylic acid, commonly known as Aspirin, is utilized broadly to relieve pain, reduce fever, and alleviate inflammation. It is also extensively employed as an antiplatelet agent, helping prevent blood clots, strokes, and myocardial infarctions. Acetylsalicylic acid's efficacy in these applications stems from its inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes—COX-1 and COX-2—which are crucial for platelet aggregation and prostaglandin synthesis. Working as a non-selective inhibitor of these enzymes, it provides anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects. Additionally, acetylsalicylic acid is implicated in cancer prevention, attributed to its interference with cancer cell signaling pathways. This drug is available in various forms, including chewable tablets and extended-release capsules, each suited for specific indications and absorption rates.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Acetylsalicylic acid primarily targets the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes by irreversibly binding to them, thus exerting its therapeutic effects on pain, fever, and inflammation. Beyond these, it impacts several other proteins like caspases, cyclins, and kinases involved in cell signaling pathways, which may influence cancer progression and immune responses. Major metabolizing enzymes for acetylsalicylic acid include CYP2C19, CYP2C9, UGT1A6, and NAT2, which are essential for its biotransformation to salicylic acid. Additionally, its interaction with transporters such as SLC22A6 and ABCB1 impacts drug distribution and excretion. Current knowledge indicates no specific carriers involved in its transport.

## Pharmacogenetics
Individual responses to acetylsalicylic acid can vary based on genetic variations. For instance, polymorphisms in the CYP2C9 gene (e.g., rs1057910) are known to influence the metabolism of the drug, potentially affecting both efficacy and toxicity. Variation in the gene ITGB3 (rs5918) implicates different responses to the drug’s antiplatelet effects, possibly requiring adjustments in dosage or alternative therapies for individuals with resistance to acetylsalicylic acid's anti-thrombotic actions. Another significant association involves the LTC4S gene (rs730012), which is linked to an increased risk of chronic urticaria in some patients treated with acetylsalicylic acid. These pharmacogenomic insights may guide personalized treatments and preventive measures, optimizing therapeutic outcomes and minimizing adverse effects.
