## Drug Summary
Dextropropoxyphene is an opioid analgesic primarily used to treat mild to moderate pain. Chemically related to methadone, dextropropoxyphene also has antitussive (cough suppressant) and local anesthetic effects. The drug exists as two enantiomers; with dextropropoxyphene being the active form. It was commonly available either alone or in combination with other analgesics such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) or aspirin. Pharmacokinetically, dextropropoxyphene is extensively metabolized by the liver, mainly by CYP3A4, and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidneys. It has a relatively short half-life of 6 to 12 hours. Due to concerns regarding safety, especially cardiotoxicity and its high potential for toxicity in overdose, dextropropoxyphene has been withdrawn from the market in many countries, including the United States and various European nations.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Dextropropoxyphene primarily functions as a mu-opioid receptor agonist which mediates its analgesic properties as well as its addictive potential. The drug's action at these receptors induces typical opioid responses such as analgesia, euphoria, and respiratory depression. In terms of metabolism, dextropropoxyphene is metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4, one of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases which is crucial for the detoxification and clearance of numerous drugs. Specific transporters and carriers related to the pharmacokinetics of dextropropoxyphene have not been well-documented, indicating primary involvement of common drug-metabolizing enzymes and general renal excretion processes. 

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of dextropropoxyphene revolves mainly around variations in the CYP3A4 enzyme. Polymorphisms in the gene encoding for CYP3A4 can significantly affect the metabolism of dextropropoxyphene, influencing both therapeutic outcomes and the risk of adverse effects. Those with reduced-function alleles might experience higher plasma levels of the drug, increasing the risk of toxicity, while individuals with increased enzyme function might metabolize the drug too quickly, reducing its efficacy. Moreover, genetic variability in opioid receptors (such as OPRM1) might also modulate the analgesic response and potential for dependency with dextropropoxyphene, although specific interactions have been more conclusively studied in other opioids like morphine or codeine. It's important to approach such pharmacogenetic correlations cautiously due to the limited specific studies directly assessing these factors with dextropropoxyphene.
