## Drug Summary
Carvedilol, commonly known under the brand names such as COREGCR, is a versatile alpha and beta blocker used predominantly to manage hypertension, heart failure, and impaired left ventricular function post-myocardial infarction. It exists as a racemic mixture, with each enantiomer contributing distinctively to its pharmacodynamic profile; the S(-) enantiomer offers both alpha-1 and beta adrenergic blockade, while the R(+) enantiomer mainly provides alpha-1 adrenergic blockade. Carvedilol has a moderate bioavailability of 25-35%, a Tmax of 1-2 hours, and its pharmacokinetics can be altered by food intake which increases Tmax. It is metabolized extensively in the liver involving multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes and is also subjected to glucuronidation before its elimination.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Carvedilol acts on a diversity of target sites including multiple adrenergic receptors (e.g., ADRB1, ADRA1A, ADRA1B, ADRA1D, ADRA2A, ADRA2B, ADRA2C) which contribute to its anti-hypertensive and cardiac effects by reducing heart rate, myocardial workload and enhancing vasodilation. Its mechanism extends to affecting other proteins like VEGFA, VCAM1, and various potassium channels (KCNH2, KCNJ2) which play roles in cardiovascular regulation and cellular electrophysiology. The drug's metabolism is extensively mediated by several CYP450 enzymes (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2D6) and UGTs (e.g., UGT1A1, UGT2B4). Carvedilol is also a substrate for the efflux transporter ABCB1, and its distribution is influenced by its binding to serum albumin (ALB).

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of carvedilol includes significant interactions attributable to variations in CYP450 enzymes which metabolize the drug. Specifically, polymorphisms in CYP2D6, which is responsible for the metabolism of carvedilol into active metabolites, can affect the drug levels and thus its efficacy and safety. For instance, patients who are poor metabolizers due to defective CYP2D6 alleles might experience increased exposure leading to adverse effects, whereas rapid metabolizers may require higher doses to achieve therapeutic effects. Pharmacogenomic data also highlight an important SNP (rs1801253) in the ADRB1 gene, influencing response to carvedilol in the treatment of hypertension, indicating that genetic variations can modulate patient responses to this medication, emphasizing the importance of personalized medicine in its clinical use.
