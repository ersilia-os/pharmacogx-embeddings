## Drug Summary
Nedocromil is classified as an anti-inflammatory agent specifically used in the management of mild to moderate asthma. It is a pyranoquinolone derivative that acts primarily by inhibiting the activation of various inflammatory cells, such as eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells, monocytes, and platelets, which are crucial in the pathophysiology of asthma. Nedocromil stands out for its ability to significantly mitigate both early and late asthmatic reactions and to reduce bronchial hyperresponsiveness when administered directly to the bronchial mucosa. Importantly, nedocromil is characterized by low absorption and is not metabolized, being excreted unchanged post-intravenous administration. Its side effects can include headache, nasal congestion, ocular irritation, and respiratory difficulties among others.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Nedocromil acts on several key targets involved in the inflammatory process, including the Cysteinyl leukotriene receptors 1 and 2 (CYSLTR1 and CYSLTR2), the fMet-Leu-Phe receptor (FPR1), the Prostaglandin D2 receptor (PTGDR), and the Heat shock protein 90-alpha (HSP90AA1). These targets are crucial in the mediation of inflammatory responses in asthma. CYSLTR1 and CYSLTR2 are involved in the pathway of leukotriene-mediated bronchoconstriction, while PTGDR and FPR1 play roles in prostaglandin and peptide-mediated inflammatory processes respectively. HSP90AA1, being a chaperone involved in protein folding, may influence the stability and function of other proteins involved in inflammation. There is no specific interaction through enzymes, transporters, or carriers reported for nedocromil, simplifying its pharmacological profile.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, there is limited direct pharmacogenetic data associated with nedocromil. However, understanding the genetic variations in its target proteins could provide insights into differential responses among patients. For example, genetic polymorphisms in receptors like CYSLTR1 and CYSLTR2, or the prostaglandin pathways influenced by PTGDR, might impact the efficacy or safety of nedocromil in certain populations. This type of inference is based on general pharmacogenetic principles where variations in drug target genes often correlate with variable drug responses. Therefore, further research might be needed to explore specific genetic markers that could predict therapeutic outcomes or risk of adverse effects in nedocromil treatment.
