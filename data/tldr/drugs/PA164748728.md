## Drug Summary
Mycophenolic acid, also known as Myfortic or Melbex, is a potent immunosuppressant used primarily to prevent organ rejection in kidney transplant recipients. It can be used alone or more commonly in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Mycophenolic acid inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), crucial for purine synthesis, affecting primarily lymphocytes and thereby suppressing immune function. This agent is derived from *Penicillium stoloniferum* and has antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties. It is available as enteric-coated tablets to reduce gastrointestinal side effects, and its pharmacokinetics are affected by food intake, displaying a dose-proportional increase in absorption from 360 mg to 2,160 mg.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Mycophenolic acid specifically targets and inhibits IMPDH types 1 and 2, crucial enzymes in the de novo synthesis of guanosine nucleotides, thus having a significant cytostatic effect on T- and B-lymphocytes. Metabolism of mycophenolic acid predominantly occurs via UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), including UGT2B7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, UGT1A1, UGT1A7, UGT1A10, and UGT1A6, which convert the drug into the pharmacologically inactive mycophenolic acid glucuronide (MPAG) and a smaller fraction into the active acyl glucuronide. CYP450 enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2C8 are also involved in its metabolism to a lesser degree. Mycophenolic acid is carried in the bloodstream bound to serum albumin (ALB).

## Pharmacogenetics
Genetic variations in the UGT enzymes, particularly UGT1A9 and UGT2B7, affect the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of mycophenolic acid, influencing both safety and efficacy in individual patients. For instance, variants in UGT1A9 have been linked to differences in drug clearance rates, which could necessitate dosage adjustments. Furthermore, genetic polymorphisms in CYP3A5 may affect the metabolism of the drug when used in conjunction with other medications metabolized by this enzyme, such as calcineurin inhibitors. Considering these pharmacogenetic associations is crucial for optimizing therapeutic outcomes and minimizing toxicity, especially in the context of transplant medicine where precise immunosuppression is critical.
