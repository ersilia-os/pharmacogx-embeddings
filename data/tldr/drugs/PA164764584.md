## Drug Summary
Rasagiline is a therapeutic agent utilized predominantly in the treatment of Parkinsonâ€™s disease. As an irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor, specifically monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B), rasagiline helps mitigate symptoms either as a monotherapy in early stages or in conjunction with levodopa during more advanced phases of the disease. Acting by preventing the breakdown of dopamine, thus facilitating an increase in extracellular levels of dopamine particularly in the striatum, it consequently augments dopaminergic activity which is crucial for motor control. Rasagiline has rapid oral absorption with an absolute bioavailability of about 36%. Its metabolism is primarily hepatic, undergoing nearly complete biotransformation mediated mainly by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 enzyme.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Rasagiline directly targets amine oxidase [flavin-containing] B (MAOB), where its action as an inhibitor leads to reduced degradation of dopamine, thereby having therapeutic utility in managing dopaminergic deficiencies such as those in Parkinson's disease. Additionally, it interacts with apoptosis regulator Bcl-2 (BCL2), although the clinical implications of this interaction are less clear. Metabolism of rasagiline is primarily dependent on the CYP1A2 enzyme. No specific transporters or carriers are identified for rasagiline, indicating its dependence on passive diffusion for cellular uptake, or no significant role of transport proteins in its pharmacokinetic profile.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of rasagiline pivot mainly around its metabolism by CYP1A2. Variations in the CYP1A2 gene can influence the rate of metabolism of rasagiline, thereby affecting its plasma levels and therapeutic efficacy. Individuals with certain polymorphisms that lead to reduced CYP1A2 activity may experience higher exposure to rasagiline, potentially heightening the risk of adverse effects, whereas those with polymorphisms leading to increased CYP1A2 activity could have reduced drug efficacy. However, comprehensive genetic testing specific to rasagiline use is not routinely performed, but awareness of potential interactions with other substances or drugs metabolized by CYP1A2 is essential in clinical settings to manage possible drug-drug interactions effectively. No detailed pharmacogenomic data is indicated directly for other aspects like the drug's efficacy or sensitivity to its effects based on genetic variations.
