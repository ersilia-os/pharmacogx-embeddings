## Drug Summary
Posaconazole, marketed under the brand name Noxafil, is a triazole antifungal medication primarily used to prevent and treat invasive fungal infections such as those caused by *Candida* and *Aspergillus* species. It is specifically indicated for prophylaxis in severely immunocompromised patients over 13 years, including hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients and patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing chemotherapy. Posaconazole works through structural alterations from itraconazole, making it more potent with a broader spectrum of activity. The drug is either fungicidal or fungistatic depending on the fungal species and infection environment. Bioavailability is moderate with a Tmax around 3-5 hours post-administration, and it is largely excreted as glucuronide conjugates, with minimal activity of CYP450-mediated oxidation.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Posaconazole executes its antifungal effects by inhibiting the enzyme sterol 14Î±-demethylase (encoded by the gene ERG11) in fungi, which is crucial for ergosterol synthesis, a key component of the fungal cell membrane. This inhibition results in the accumulation of toxic precursors and disruption of cell membrane integrity, leading to fungal cell death. Human enzymes involved include CYP3A4, indicating that posaconazole might be a substrate for this enzyme which is known to play a role in metabolism of many drugs, potentially affecting posaconazole levels with inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4. Moreover, posaconazole is a substrate for the transporter ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), which could influence its distribution and excretion. There is no data on specific carriers involved in its transport.

## Pharmacogenetics
Due to its interaction with CYP3A4 and ABCB1, posaconazole pharmacokinetics may be influenced by genetic variations in these proteins. Variants in the *CYP3A4* gene can alter enzyme activity, possibly affecting drug concentrations and effectiveness. Likewise, polymorphisms in the *ABCB1* gene may impact the distribution and excretion of posaconazole, influencing both efficacy and toxicity. However, specific pharmacogenetic guidelines or associations for posaconazole based on variations in these genes are not well-established. Future studies and clinical observations will be crucial to determine the clinical relevance of these genetic factors for tailoring posaconazole therapy for optimal safety and efficacy.
