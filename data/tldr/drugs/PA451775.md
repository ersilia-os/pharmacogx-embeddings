## Drug Summary
Trifluridine, known under various brand names including Thilol, Triflumann, Triherpine, and Virophta, is a fluorinated pyrimidine nucleoside with potent antiviral and antineoplastic activities. Primarily, as an ophthalmic solution, trifluridine treats primary keratoconjunctivitis and recurrent epithelial keratitis due to herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Additionally, in combination with tipiracil (trade name Lonsurf), it is approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in patients who have exhausted specific previous chemotherapy options. Trifluridine acts by getting incorporated into DNA, disrupting DNA function and replication in viral and tumor cells.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Trifluridine functions by incorporation into viral and cancer cell DNA facilitated by key enzymes and transport proteins. Its key target is thymidylate synthase (TYMS), an essential enzyme for DNA synthesis. Trifluridine’s active form arises after phosphorylation by thymidine kinase (TK1) and further conversion to nucleotides by thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP). Transporter proteins such as SLC22A6, SLC28A1, SLC29A1, and SLC29A2 facilitate the cellular uptake of trifluridine, enhancing its therapeutic effects. Additionally, it binds to serum proteins like albumin (ALB) which could affect its distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
While the drug information does not explicitly list pharmacogenetic data for trifluridine, there are inferences to be drawn based on its mechanism. The expression and activity of enzymes such as TYMS, TK1, and TYMP, which are involved in trifluridine’s metabolism, are potentially susceptible to genetic variation. For example, variations in the gene coding for thymidine kinase could affect the phosphorylation rate of trifluridine, potentially altering its efficacy or toxicity profile. Similarly, variations in TYMS could influence resistance to trifluridine, especially in cancer treatment settings. Patients with different alleles of these genes might exhibit different responses to the drug, necessitating personalized dosing or alternative treatments. However, concrete pharmacogenetic guidelines for trifluridine use based on individual genetic makeup are not well-established and would benefit from further clinical investigations.
