## Drug Summary
Velpatasvir is a direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agent used primarily in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection across all six major genotypes. It is often used in combination with sofosbuvir under the brand name Epclusa. This combination is recommended by guidelines such as those from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) for its high efficacy, offering a sustained virologic response (SVR) rate of 93-99% after 12 weeks of therapy, depending on the patient's genotype and cirrhosis status. Velpatasvir inhibits the HCV non-structural protein 5A (NS5A), which is vital for viral replication and assembly. The oral bioavailability of velpatasvir is approximately 25-30%, and it is metabolized primarily by the enzymes CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Velpatasvir targets the HCV NS5A protein, interfering with virus replication and assembly. The key enzymes involved in velpatasvir metabolism include CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4. These cytochrome P450 enzymes catalyze the drug's metabolism, potentially influencing its plasma levels and therapeutic effects. Transporters involved in velpatasvir disposition include ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2), SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, and SLCO2B1. These transporters can affect the drug's absorption and distribution, thereby impacting its efficacy and toxicity profile. There are no specific carriers listed in the provided data for velpatasvir.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of velpatasvir primarily relates to its metabolism mediated by CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4, and the involvement of several transporters like ABCB1, ABCG2, and SLCO family members. Variants in these CYP genes may affect the drug's metabolism, potentially requiring dose adjustments or careful monitoring in some patients. For instance, polymorphisms in CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 might alter drug levels, influencing both efficacy and adverse effect profiles. Variation in transporter genes such as ABCB1, and SLCO1B1 could impact drug distribution and elimination, also affecting the drug's effectiveness and safety. These genetic factors are crucial for personalized medicine, ensuring optimal dosing and minimizing adverse effects, particularly in patients with complex HCV infection profiles or those with co-infections like HIV.
