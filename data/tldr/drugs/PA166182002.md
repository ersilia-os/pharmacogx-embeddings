## Drug Summary
Amifampridine phosphate, also known as 3,4-diaminopyridine phosphate, is a potassium channel blocker primarily used to treat Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), a rare autoimmune disorder. It is marketed under the name Firdapse. The mechanism of action involves blocking voltage-dependent potassium channels, which prolongs the action potential and enhances the release of acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions, improving muscle strength in LEMS patients. The drug is usually administered orally and has a rapid onset of action. Its pharmacokinetics include a short plasma half-life, necessitating multiple daily doses to maintain its therapeutic effect.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Amifampridine phosphate specifically targets voltage-gated potassium channels (VGPCs). By blocking these channels, the drug prevents potassium from exiting the nerve terminal, which is crucial for returning the depolarized nerve terminal to its resting state. This action leads to an increased calcium influx, which subsequently enhances the release of acetylcholine. There is limited specific information on metabolizing enzymes, transporters, or carriers directly linked to amifampridine phosphate's absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) profile, implying that further research might be needed to fully elucidate these aspects.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of amifampridine phosphate hasn't been extensively studied in the context of genetic variability affecting its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. Given its mechanism of action and therapeutic use, future research may explore potential genetic markers that could predict patient responses or susceptibility to side effects. Current clinical use does not include routine pharmacogenetic testing, but as understanding evolves, this may change, especially to enhance therapeutic efficacy and safety for individual patients with LEMS.
