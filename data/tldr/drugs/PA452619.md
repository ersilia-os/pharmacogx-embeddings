## Drug Summary
Diamorphine, commonly known as heroin, is a potent opioid analgesic primarily used in the United Kingdom for the relief of severe pain such as that associated with surgical procedures, myocardial infarction, or in terminally ill patients. It is also prescribed for acute pulmonary edema. When administered, diamorphine shows rapid absorption and onset of analgesic effects, particularly when injected due to its lipophilicity which allows quick crossing of the blood-brain barrier. Once in the brain, it is metabolized into morphine and 6-monoacetylmorphine, with morphine being the primary active metabolite that binds to opioid receptors. The bioavailability of orally administered diamorphine is remarkably low due to extensive first-pass metabolism, hence it’s often administered via other routes for medical use.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Diamorphine acts primarily through the mu-type opioid receptor (OPRM1), but also interacts with the kappa-type (OPRK1) and delta-type (OPRD1) opioid receptors. These receptors mediate the drug's analgesic and euphoric effects. Morphine, as the active metabolite resulting from diamorphine metabolism, is chiefly responsible for the activation of these receptors. The metabolism of diamorphine into active metabolites is facilitated by liver carboxylesterase 1 (CES1). Additionally, thyroxine-binding globulin (SERPINA7) has been identified as a carrier associated with diamorphine, possibly influencing its distribution or effects. No specific transporters are listed, suggesting limited involvement or undefined transporter interactions in the pharmacokinetics of diamorphine.

## Pharmacogenetics
Diamorphine’s pharmacogenetics primarily involves the genetic variants affecting the opioid receptors (OPRM1, OPRK1, OPRD1) and the metabolizing enzyme CES1. Variants within the OPRM1 gene, for instance, are known to affect individual responses to opioid drugs, potentially influencing the analgesic efficacy and risk of addiction or adverse effects when using diamorphine. Although specific pharmacogenomic data for diamorphine is not extensively detailed, it can be inferred that variations in these genes could alter the therapeutic response or risk profile of the drug in different individuals. CES1 genetic variants might also impact the speed and extent of diamorphine metabolization to morphine, further modulating its pharmacodynamic effects. Overall, the pharmacogenetic impact on diamorphine use underlines the importance of considering genetic factors when prescribing and managing therapy with this powerful opioid.
