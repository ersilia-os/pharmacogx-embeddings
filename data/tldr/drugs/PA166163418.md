## Drug Summary
Rucaparib is a small molecule inhibitor of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family, primarily targeting PARP-1, PARP-2, and PARP-3. It is used in the treatment of various cancers, predominantly ovarian and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers that harbor deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Rucaparib exploits the concept of synthetic lethality, specifically targeting cancer cells deficient in homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair mechanisms due to BRCA mutations. It was granted FDA accelerated approval in December 2016. Rucaparib has a linear pharmacokinetics profile, with dose-dependent increases in exposure, a median T_max of approximately 1.9 hours, and primary metabolization by CYP2D6 along with CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. It is also known for contributing to chemosensitization and vasodilatory effects that may enhance tumor drug accumulation.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Rucaparib primarily inhibits PARP1, PARP2, and PARP3, enzymes crucial for the repair of single-stranded DNA breaks. It is metabolized largely by CYP2D6 with additional involvement of CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and several other CYP enzymes. Rucaparib is also subjected to conjugation reactions such as N-demethylation, glucuronidation (via UGT1A1), and perhaps N-methylation. The drug affects multiple transporters, notably P-glycoproteins ABCB1 and ABCG2, which could influence drug efflux from cells. Other significant transporters include those involved in renal clearance and hepatic uptake like SLC22A1, SLCO1B1, and SLCO1B3.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of rucaparib is significantly influenced by genetic variations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, with its mechanism predicated on the deficiency of functional BRCA proteins and consequently impaired HR repair mechanism, making cancer cells particularly vulnerable to double-strand breaks that cannot be effectively repaired. Variations in the metabolizing enzyme genes CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4 may impact rucaparib's metabolism and thus its pharmacokinetics and potential toxicity. Variable expression or function of drug transporters such as ABCB1 and ABCG2 could affect the drug's absorption and distribution. This tailoring of treatment based on genetic factors affects both the efficacy and safety profile of rucaparib, presenting a compelling case for pharmacogenetic testing in personalized medicine, especially for predicting response and adjusting dosages in cancer therapy.
