## Drug Summary
Levofloxacin, traded under various names including Cravit and Tavanic, is a third-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic identified by the optical S-(-) isomer of ofloxacin. It possesses significant efficacy against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens and is particularly enhanced against those that typically provoke respiratory infections. It's utilized to treat infections of the respiratory tract, skin, urinary tract, prostate, and specific conditions like inhalational anthrax and plague. Levofloxacin's mechanism involves the inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, crucial for DNA replication and cell division, thereby exerting a bactericidal effect. Its rapid and essentially complete oral absorption leads to interchangeable dosing with its IV form. Due to minimal metabolism in humans, most of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Levofloxacin acts primarily by inhibiting two bacterial enzymes critical for DNA functions – DNA gyrase (gyrA) and topoisomerase IV (parC), particularly targeting their A subunits in bacteria like Haemophilus influenzae. It shows limited metabolism involving mainly CYP2C9 for the minor production of metabolites. Moreover, it interacts with various transporters including P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), multiple members of the SLC22 family like SLC22A1, SLC22A2, and SLC22A4 which are responsible for its renal secretion, and organic anion transporters such as SLCO1A2 and SLCO4C1. Levofloxacin is also bound by serum albumin (ALB), impacting its distribution.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic interactions of levofloxacin are not extensively documented in major databases or literature. However, the involvement of CYP2C9 and transport proteins such as ABCB1 suggests potential genetic variability in pharmacokinetics and dynamics could impact efficacy and safety. Variants in these genes might affect the drug’s metabolism and transport, altering exposure levels, effectiveness, and risk of adverse effects. Specifically, polymorphisms in ABCB1 could influence drug efflux from cells, potentially affecting drug concentrations in target tissues. While concrete pharmacogenetic guidelines for levofloxacin are not established, considering genetic testing may be prudent in cases of unusual responses or adverse effects.
