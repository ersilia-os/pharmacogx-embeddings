## Drug Summary
Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactamase inhibitor primarily used in combination with antibiotics such as amoxicillin and ticarcillin to counteract antibiotic resistance. Derived from Streptomyces clavuligerus, it broadens the therapeutic effectiveness of the antibiotics against a variety of beta-lactamase producing bacteria. Clavulanic acid itself does not possess significant antibacterial activity; rather, it prevents the degradation of penicillin derivatives by inhibiting beta-lactamases. This pharmacodynamic interaction allows amoxicillin and similar antibiotics to remain active and effective in treating bacterial infections. Indicated for use in conditions like sinusitis, urinary tract infections, and lower respiratory infections, clavulanic acid extends the antibacterial spectrum to include strains that would otherwise degrade unaided beta-lactams. It is particularly noted for its effective augmentation against organisms like H. influenzae, S. aureus, and various Enterobacter species. The absorption of clavulanic acid occurs efficiently in the gastrointestinal tract with a reported bioavailability of approximately 64%.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
As a mechanism of pharmacological action, clavulanic acid contains a beta-lactam ring that binds irreversibly to beta-lactamases at the active site. This binding renders the enzyme ineffective at breaking down beta-lactam antibiotics, ensuring the antibiotics can reach concentrations sufficient to exert a therapeutic effect. There are no specific targets linked to its antibacterial activity, as clavulanic acid functions primarily as an enzyme inhibitor. Regarding its pharmacokinetics, clavulanic acid engages with certain transporters, particularly the Sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 (SLC5A1). This interaction could influence its absorption and distribution within the body, although specific details of the implications are less clear.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, specific pharmacogenetic data related to clavulanic acid are limited. The primary concern with its use pertains to its mechanism of inhibiting beta-lactamases and not a direct interaction with human genomic factors that might alter drug response significantly. However, considering the role of transporters such as SLC5A1 in the uptake and distribution of clavulanic acid, genetic variants affecting the expression or function of these transporters could potentially influence the pharmacokinetics and overall efficacy of the drug. Further research would be necessary to establish any significant pharmacogenetic associations, including impacts on drug absorption linked to transporter gene variants.
