## Drug Summary
Sumatriptan, marketed under various brand names such as Imitrex, Imigran, and several others, is a serotonin receptor agonist primarily used to treat migraines and cluster headaches. It was first approved in Europe in 1991 and later by the FDA in 1992 for migraine management. Sumatriptan acts by constricting cranial blood vessels and inhibiting the release of vasoactive peptides, which are involved in the pathophysiology of migraine headaches. The drug is available in multiple forms, including tablets, nasal sprays, and subcutaneous injections, each with varying bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profiles. The subcutaneous form offers the highest bioavailability, near 100%, with rapid absorption, whereas oral and intranasal forms have lower bioavailability and slower absorption rates. Sumatriptan is extensively metabolized, primarily by monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), into inactive metabolites.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Sumatriptanâ€™s mechanism of action is linked to its role as an agonist at the 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>, and lesser-known 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> serotonin receptors, leading to the inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release and constriction of cranial blood vessels. The drug's metabolism is largely handled by enzyme MAOA, which converts it into inactive metabolites. Transport is influenced by various transporters including SLCO1A2, ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1), ABCG2, and SLCO1B1, which may impact the drug's delivery into target tissues and clearances from the body. No specific carriers are noted, suggesting less involvement in direct transport-related mechanisms in efficacy or clearance.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic insights reveal that Sumatriptan response can vary based on genetic make-up. Particularly, the GNB3 gene's rs5443 variant has been associated with an increased likelihood of responding to sumatriptan in treating cluster headaches. This suggests a genotype-driven preferential response, which could guide personalized treatment approaches in clinical settings, especially for conditions like cluster headaches where treatment options are limited. Such genotype-associated responses should continue to be explored to enhance therapeutic efficacy and reduce adverse effects in migraine and headache management.
