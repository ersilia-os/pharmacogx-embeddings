## Drug Summary
Phenazopyridine, also known under various brand names such as AZO-Standard, Pyridium, and Uristat, is a urinary tract analgesic primarily used to alleviate uncomfortable symptoms associated with urinary tract irritations. These irritations may stem from surgery, endoscopic procedures, infection, or catheter insertions. While Phenazopyridine offers symptomatic relief, it does not possess antimicrobial properties and is usually complemented by an antimicrobial therapy. The drug is principally absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, exhibits a peak plasma concentration within a few hours post-ingestion, and is metabolized predominantly in the liver. The therapeutic effects are believed to result from its action as a local anesthetic on the mucosal lining of the urinary tract, likely due to its ability to inhibit voltage-gated sodium channels.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary mechanism by which Phenazopyridine exerts its analgesic effects involves the inhibition of the Sodium channel protein type 1 subunit alpha (SCN1A). This action leads to the relief of pain and discomfort by reducing nerve signal transmission within the urinary tract. No specific enzymes, transporters, or carriers have been specified for this drug in the provided or general database records, indicating the lack of significant interactions of this type or that it has not been thoroughly studied in this context.

## Pharmacogenetics
Phenazopyridine's pharmacokinetics may be influenced by genetic variations, particularly those affecting liver metabolism enzymes and kidney function. However, there is limited specific information regarding pharmacogenetic markers directly influencing Phenazopyridineâ€™s efficacy and safety. Patients with Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency should exercise caution as they are at higher risk for hemolysis with normal doses of the drug. The drug has been tied to methemoglobinemia cases in certain genetic backgrounds, particularly in overdose cases or with certain metabolic deficiencies. Additional research in pharmacogenetics could clarify specific genetic modifiers that impact the metabolism and toxicity profile of Phenazopyridine.
