## Drug Summary
Avapritinib, also known by the name BLU-285, is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor primarily used for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) harboring specific PDGFRA exon 18 mutations, including PDGFRA D842V mutations, and in adult patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis (AdvSM). This encompasses conditions such as aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematological neoplasm (SM-AHN), and mast cell leukemia. Avapritinib was approved by the FDA in January 2020 and by the EMA in September 2020. Its pharmacological profile includes a once-daily oral dosing with significant bioavailability, achieving peak plasma concentrations relatively quickly. It is metabolized predominantly through CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 enzymes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Avapritinib acts mainly by inhibiting the activity of the KIT kinase and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA), which are crucial in the pathophysiology of GIST and systemic mastocytosis. An important aspect of its mechanism is the negative modulation of the efflux transporters such as ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1) and ABCG2, which are known to mediate multidrug resistance in cancers; this resensitizes cancerous cells to other chemotherapy agents like paclitaxel. It is also associated with the transporters ABCB11, SLC47A1, and SLC47A2. The drug does not appear to be associated with any specific carriers based on the provided information.

## Pharmacogenetics
Avapritinibâ€™s efficacy is significantly influenced by mutations in the PDGFRA gene, especially the exon 18 D842V mutation in GIST patients, which defines a specific patient subgroup responsive to this therapy. Furthermore, its metabolism by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 indicates potential variability in drug levels based on genetic variants affecting these enzymes' activities. Variants in CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 could potentially alter avapritinib's pharmacokinetics, impacting efficacy and toxicity. While detailed genomic data specific to avapritinib were not provided, general knowledge concerning the pharmacogenetics of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 suggests a need to consider genetic testing in cases of unusual drug responses or adverse effects.
