## Drug Summary
Gemcitabine, marketed as Gemzar and available in various formulations under names such as Abine, Oncogem, and Xtroz, is a chemotherapeutic agent primarily used in the treatment of various cancers including ovarian, non-small cell lung (NSCLC), pancreatic, and breast cancer. It is a nucleoside analog that interferes with DNA synthesis, resulting in the inhibition of cancer cell growth and induction of apoptosis. Gemcitabine is typically administered intravenously and its use ranges from monotherapy in pancreatic cancer to combination therapies with agents like carboplatin and cisplatin for other types. The drug shows a cytotoxic effect by integrating into DNA chains during synthesis, especially during the G1/S-phase of cell division, leading to the apoptosis of tumor cells.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Gemcitabine acts on several cellular targets, enzymes, and transporters to exert its pharmacological effects. Key targets include Ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase large subunit (RRM1), Thymidylate synthase (TYMS), and UMP-CMP kinase (CMPK1), all instrumental in nucleic acid synthesis processes. Among the enzymes involved, Deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) is crucial for the initial phosphorylation of gemcitabine to its active metabolites (dFdCDP and dFdCTP), which incorporate into DNA and disrupt its synthesis. Nucleoside transporters such as SLC29A1 and SLC28A1 play significant roles in the cellular uptake of the drug, ensuring its availability within tumor cells for effective action. Cytidine deaminase (CDA) leads to the breakdown of the drug, influencing its plasma concentration and effectiveness.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors significantly influence gemcitabine's effectiveness and toxicity profile. Polymorphisms in the RRM1 gene, involved in DNA synthesis, have been linked to varied responses and toxicities in patients treated with gemcitabine. For instance, the rs9937 polymorphism in RRM1 is associated with an increased risk of neutropenia and neurotoxicity in patients receiving gemcitabine. Similarly, the expression levels and variants of enzymes like DCK and CDA can affect drug metabolism and clearance, thereby modifying the drug's efficacy and safety. Understanding these genetic variations is crucial for optimizing gemcitabine therapy, tailoring treatments to achieve the best therapeutic outcomes with minimal adverse effects. Such pharmacogenetic insights are essential for precision medicine approaches in oncology.
