## Drug Summary
Allopurinol, known under various brand names such as Adenock, Allohexal, Alloril, Aluron, Milurit, Progout, Zyloric, and Zyrik, is a crucial pharmaceutical used primarily in the management of gout, certain types of kidney stones, and conditions that lead to increased levels of uric acid resulting from cancer therapy. Allopurinol acts by inhibiting the xanthine oxidase enzyme, thereby reducing uric acid production. It was first approved by the FDA in 1966 and is generally well-absorbed, achieving peak plasma levels within a few hours after oral administration. Metabolically, allopurinol is converted in the liver to oxipurinol, which also acts as a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, contributing to the hypouricemic effects of the drug.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Allopurinol and its active metabolite, oxipurinol, target xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase (XDH), crucial for converting hypoxanthine to xanthine and ultimately to uric acid. This inhibition reduces serum and urinary uric acid levels. Metabolism involves enzymes like xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase (AOX1). Additionally, transporters such as SLC22A8, SLC22A7, ABCG2, and SLC22A2 play roles in the drug's pharmacokinetics, affecting the distribution and excretion of allopurinol and its metabolites, influencing both efficacy and safety profiles.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of allopurinol includes significant interactions, particularly involving the HCP5 gene. The allele rs2395029 within this gene has been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions in patients treated with allopurinol, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. This finding emphasizes the need for genetic screening in certain populations before initiating therapy with allopurinol to mitigate potential severe drug reactions. These pharmacogenetic markers can guide personalized dosing regimens and patient selection for allopurinol therapy, thereby enhancing therapeutic outcomes and minimizing adverse effects.
