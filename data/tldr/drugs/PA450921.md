## Drug Summary
Phenprocoumon, sold under various brand names like Falithrom, Liquamar, Marcoumar, and Marcumar, is a coumarin derivative used as a long-acting oral anticoagulant. It is primarily indicated for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic diseases, including venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and ischemic stroke in atrial fibrillation patients. The drug works by antagonizing vitamin K, crucial for producing clotting factors in the liver, thereby preventing the further extension of clots and secondary thromboembolic complications. Phenprocoumon has a bioavailability close to 100%, with its absorption and action beginning quickly after oral administration. Once in the body, it is metabolized predominantly in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes into inactive metabolites, and its toxicity includes symptoms related to abnormal bleeding.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The primary target of Phenprocoumon is Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1), crucial for vitamin K recycling and necessary for activating vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. This action leads to reduced activation of factors II, VII, IX, X, and anticoagulant proteins C and S, impacting blood coagulation. The metabolism of Phenprocoumon involves several cytochromes P450 (CYP450) enzymes such as CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which help convert the drug into its inactive hydroxylated metabolites. Additionally, the drug binds to carriers like serum albumin (ALB) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1), which can influence its pharmacokinetics by affecting its distribution and half-life in the blood.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of Phenprocoumon is notably influenced by variants in genes encoding for its metabolic enzymes and target proteins. Specific allelic variants in CYP2C9, notably rs1799853 and rs1057910, are associated with reduced metabolic activity, leading to variations in drug plasma levels and increased risk of bleeding complications in affected individuals. These polymorphisms necessitate dosage adjustments to avoid toxic effects. Another critical genetic factor is polymorphism rs9934438 in VKORC1, which also results in altered metabolism of Phenprocoumon, impacting the efficacy and safety of the drug. Patients with these genetic variations require careful monitoring and dosage adjustments to achieve optimal anticoagulation while minimizing adverse effects. Genetic testing can offer valuable insights into the appropriate management of Phenprocoumon therapy, tailoring treatment according to individual genetic profiles.
