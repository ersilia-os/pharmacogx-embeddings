## Drug Summary
Acetylcysteine, known commercially as Fluimucil, Lysox, and Mucolysin, is both a mucolytic agent and an antidote for acetaminophen overdose. Approved by the FDA in 1963, acetylcysteine acts by breaking down the disulfide bonds in mucin, thereby decreasing mucus viscosity. It is also an essential antioxidant that stimulates glutathione synthesis, helping to manage oxidative stress. In cases of acetaminophen toxicity, it provides cysteine for glutathione production, essential for conjugating and detoxifying N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), a harmful metabolite produced during overdose. Maximum serum levels are reached about two hours after oral administration of an effervescent tablet, showing its rapid action onset.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Acetylcysteine interacts with several targets involved in its pharmacological actions. Key targets include Glutathione synthetase (GSS), vital for glutathione production, and various subunits of the NMDA receptor (GRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN2D, GRIN3A), which may relate to its neuroprotective roles. The primary enzyme metabolizing acetylcysteine is Aminoacylase-1 (ACY1), converting it to cysteine, further integrated into metabolic pathways. Transporters such as SLCO1B1 and SLC22A6 are also involved, affecting the drug's pharmacokinetics. Albumin (ALB) serves as a carrier, potentially influencing its distribution and half-life in the plasma.

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic data specific to acetylcysteine are not well-documented. However, enzyme and transporter proteins involved in its metabolism and transport could exhibit genetic variations influencing individual response and toxicity profiles. For instance, variations in genes encoding for organic anion transporting polypeptides (e.g., SLCO1B1) and amino acid transporters (e.g., SLC22A6) might impact the effectiveness and safety of acetylcysteine, particularly in treating acetaminophen toxicity where rapid drug transport and metabolism are crucial. Although inferential, assessing these genetic factors could provide insights for personalized therapy, particularly in overdose scenarios or chronic administration conditions. Further studies are needed to establish robust pharmacogenomic correlations.
