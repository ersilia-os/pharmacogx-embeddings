## Drug Summary
Carbocisteine, known by various brand names such as Actithiol, Lisomucil, Muciclar, Mucodyne, Mucolex, Rhinathiol, and Transbronchin, is a mucolytic agent used primarily to reduce mucus viscosity, aiding in the clearance of secretions in respiratory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This drug is indicated for the alleviation of symptoms like dyspnea and cough, and it is available over-the-counter and in prescription forms in many parts of Asia, Europe, and South America, though it is not approved in the USA or Canada. The pharmacodynamics of carbocisteine involve its mucolytic and anti-inflammatory effects, which help lower sputum viscosity and potentially reduce infections by interrupting bacterial adherence to lung cells. Absorption occurs rapidly with peak concentrations reached between 1 to 1.7 hours post-ingestion.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Carbocisteine acts on multiple molecular targets to exert its effects. It mainly targets enzymes like cysteine dioxygenase type 1 (CDO1) and phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase (PAH), both crucial in its metabolic process. Another significant interaction occurs with the enzyme lactosylceramide alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase (ST3GAL5), which is involved in the drugâ€™s mechanism to alter the glycoprotein content of mucus. The molecular action of carbocisteine includes the modulation of sialomucins and fucomucins balance in the bronchial mucus, which reduces its viscosity. There are no specific transporters or carriers mentioned in the provided data, which might influence the pharmacokinetics of carbocisteine.

## Pharmacogenetics
The metabolism of carbocisteine involves processes such as acetylation, decarboxylation, and sulfoxidation, with significant interindividual variability attributed to genetic polymorphisms. Notably, enzymes such as CDO1 and PAH, responsible for its metabolism, exhibit variability in activity among different individuals potentially due to genetic differences. These polymorphisms can profoundly affect the drug's efficacy and safety profile, explaining the variable clinical responses observed among patients. Understanding these genetic variations could be crucial for optimizing treatment with carbocisteine, although detailed genomic data or specific pharmacogenetic guidelines are not provided in this summary. This aspect underscores the importance of further research into the pharmacogenetics of carbocisteine to enhance personalized therapy in respiratory disease management.
