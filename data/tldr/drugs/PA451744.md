## Drug Summary
Trazodone, marketed under various brand names such as Desyrel, Molipaxin, and Trittico, belongs to the class of serotonin receptor antagonists and reuptake inhibitors (SARIs). It is primarily used for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and exhibits comparable efficacy to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Off-label uses include treatment of anxiety, insomnia, and symptoms of dementia. Trazodone differentiates itself by minimizing common SSRI and SNRI side effects such as anxiety, sexual dysfunction, and insomnia. Absorption of trazodone is rapid, with a high bioavailability (63-91%), and its effect can be influenced by food intake. It is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by the CYP3A4 enzyme, producing the active metabolite m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP).

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The pharmacological targets of trazodone include several serotonin receptors (5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C), the sodium-dependent serotonin transporter (SLC6A4), histamine H1 receptor (HRH1), and alpha-adrenergic receptors (ADRA1A, ADRA2A). These diverse interactions underlie its effects on mood, anxiety, and sleep. Metabolism involves cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent, CYP3A5 and CYP2D6. Trazodone's transport across cell membranes is facilitated by the transporter protein P-glycoprotein (ABCB1).

## Pharmacogenetics
Specific genomic variations in metabolizing enzymes like CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 can influence trazodone's efficacy and safety. Individuals with variants in these genes may process trazodone differently, leading to variations in blood levels, effectiveness, and side effects. Responses to trazodone can also be affected by genetic polymorphisms in the serotonin transporters (particularly SLC6A4) and receptors (HTR2A, HTR2C), which can impact its antidepressant efficacy and propensity to cause side effects such as weight gain or sexual dysfunction. Although comprehensive genomic data specific to trazodone are limited, these pharmacogenetic considerations are vital for personalized therapy, especially in populations with known genetic predispositions.
