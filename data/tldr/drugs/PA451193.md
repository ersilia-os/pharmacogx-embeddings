## Drug Summary
Pyrimethamine, licensed under the trade names Daraprim and others, is an antiparasitic and antimicrobial agent primarily used to treat toxoplasmosis and acute malaria, particularly in areas where malaria is known to be resistant to pyrimethamine but not for preventing it. Classified as a folic acid antagonist, pyrimethamine selectively inhibits parasitic enzymes necessary for nucleic acid synthesis, thereby obstructing DNA synthesis and cell multiplication critical for parasite growth. It is especially effective against Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii. Pyrimethamine is administered orally and is well-absorbed, achieving peak blood levels within 2 to 6 hours. It undergoes hepatic metabolism and has noted activity against blood and some tissue schizonts of malaria parasites, though it does not impact gametocytes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Pyrimethamine operates by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) in humans, which blocks the formation of tetrahydrofolate necessary for DNA synthesis. This significantly hampers the proliferation capabilities of parasites. Among the important targets of pyrimethamine in humans, besides DHFR, are enzymes like beta-hexosaminidase subunit beta (HEXB), which plays a role in metabolic functions not directly related to pyrimethamine's anti-parasitic action. Additionally, Pyrimethamine's effects on Plasmodium falciparum are due in part to its inhibition of the bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase enzyme. Pertaining to pharmacokinetic modulating factors, pyrimethamine is metabolized by cytochromes, notably CYP2C8, and is transported mainly by the multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins SLC47A1 and SLC47A2.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic impact of pyrimethamine largely revolves around variations in the genes encoding its metabolic and transport proteins. The enzyme CYP2C8, responsible for its metabolism, may exhibit genetic polymorphisms that can affect the drug's plasma levels, efficacy, and risk of toxicity. Patients with certain variants of CYP2C8 might process pyrimethamine differently, potentially necessitating dosage adjustments or alternative therapies. Furthermore, genetic variability in the transporters SLC47A1 and SLC47A2 could influence the disposition of the drug, affecting both distribution and elimination processes. While no direct pharmacogenetic data are provided in the presented profile, these are inferred points of concern and investigation in clinical pharmacogenetics regarding pyrimethamine that could enhance personalized medicine approaches in its administration for malaria and toxoplasmosis treatment.
