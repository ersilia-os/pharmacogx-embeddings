## Drug Summary
Lumefantrine is an antimalarial drug primarily used in combination with artemether for treating acute uncomplicated malaria. It is part of the artemisinin combination therapy (ACT), a recommended treatment for *Plasmodium falciparum* malaria, especially in regions where resistance to chloroquine is a concern. Lumefantrine inhibits the formation of β-hematin, thereby disrupting nucleic acid and protein synthesis in the malaria parasite, although its exact mechanism of action remains not fully understood. Lumefantrine has a long half-life, which supports its role in clearing residual parasites after the rapid action of artemether. Its absorption is significantly enhanced by food, and it is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4, with desbutyl-lumefantrine being the major metabolite.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Lumefantrine lacks specific protein targets according to the provided data, focusing instead on disrupting the metabolic pathways of the malaria parasite indirectly. Its metabolism is largely handled by liver enzymes where Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) plays a primary role, substantiating its significant influence on the drug’s pharmacokinetic profile. Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is also listed as involved in its metabolic process, which may imply a secondary pathway or minor role. No specific transporters or carriers are documented in relation to lumefantrine transport within the human body based on the provided data.

## Pharmacogenetics
Focusing on pharmacogenetics, the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of lumefantrine indicate potential variability in drug response based on genetic differences. Variants within the CYP3A4 gene can lead to differences in metabolism speed, affecting both the efficacy and toxicity of lumefantrine. For instance, some individuals with specific CYP3A4 alleles may metabolize lumefantrine more slowly, leading to increased exposure and potential toxicity, or more rapidly, possibly reducing drug efficacy. Similarly, although CYP2D6 is less central, genetic variations in this enzyme could potentially alter drug levels and effects. No direct genomic data link was provided in the summary, and thus specific genotype-related dosage recommendations are not available. However, these enzymatic pathways suggest that genetic testing could be beneficial in tailoring treatments for optimal efficacy and safety.
