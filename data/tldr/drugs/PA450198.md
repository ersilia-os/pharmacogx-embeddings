## Drug Summary
Levoleucovorin, also known by its brand name Fusilev, is the pharmacologically active enantiomer of folinic acid, utilized primarily to diminish the toxic effects of certain chemotherapy drugs, notably methotrexate. It acts as a rescue therapy in high-dose methotrexate treatments for diseases such as osteosarcoma and is used in palliative care of advanced metastatic colorectal cancer when combined with 5-fluorouracil. Unlike the racemic mixture of leucovorin, levoleucovorin consists only of the active levo-isomer, which is rapidly converted in the body to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, the main form of active reduced folate. This bypasses the need for reduction by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme inhibited by methotrexate, thereby replenishing needed co-factors for DNA synthesis and reducing therapy-related toxicity. Levoleucovorin is absorbed rapidly after intravenous administration and extensively metabolized to active tetrahydrofolic acid derivatives.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Levoleucovorin is designed to target the metabolic pathways affected by DHFR inhibitors like methotrexate. Its primary identified molecular target is serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), specifically from Shigella flexneri, extrapolated as relevant to human SHMT. This enzyme plays a critical role in the folate cycle, important for nucleotide biosynthesis and homocysteine remethylation. According to the provided data, levoleucovorin has no explicitly listed enzymes, transporters, or carriers linked to its pharmacokinetic profile. However, the drug is known to undergo passive and active transport across cell membranes, facilitated by its conversion to 5-methyl-THF, which then participates intracellularly as polyglutamated folylpolyglutamates in essential biochemical pathways.

## Pharmacogenetics
Currently, specific pharmacogenetic data linked to levoleucovorin itself are not provided or well-characterized in mainstream databases, including DrugBank or PharmGKB. Nonetheless, because levoleucovorin acts to mitigate methotrexate toxicity through folate metabolism pathways, genes involved in folate transport and metabolism, such as those encoding for DHFR, SHMT, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), could potentially influence its pharmacodynamics and efficacy. Alterations in these genes might affect the efficacy or necessary dosing of levoleucovorin due to differences in folate handling and metabolism, although clinical data specifically confirming these interactions are limited. Therefore, any pharmacogenetic implications are currently inferred based on the role of levoleucovorin in these metabolic pathways and its interaction with methotrexate. Further research would be required to substantiate these potential pharmacogenetic interactions.
