## Drug Summary
Dexamethasone is a synthetic corticosteroid with potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant properties, often denoted by its clinical label MK-125. Approved by the FDA in 1958, it is used to treat a wide array of conditions including endocrine disorders, rheumatic problems, skin diseases, allergies, eye conditions, gastrointestinal disturbances, respiratory issues, hematologic disorders, cancer-related symptoms, and swelling-related conditions. Dexamethasone plays a crucial role in managing severe COVID-19 cases, particularly reducing mortality in those requiring ventilation and oxygen by modifying inflammation responses through glucocorticoid receptor binding. It is administered via multiple routes including oral, intravenous, intramuscular, and topical applications with varying pharmacokinetics. Intramuscular absorption is slower compared to intravenous, providing a delayed peak concentration.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Dexamethasone functions primarily through binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), promoting anti-inflammatory actions and inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines. Other targets include Nuclear receptor subfamily 0 group B member 1 (NR0B1), Annexin A1 (ANXA1), inducible Nitric oxide synthase (NOS2), and Nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 2 (NR1I2). Its metabolism is primarily mediated by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4, with minor contributions from several other CYP enzymes. Dexamethasone is also metabolized by corticosteroid 11-beta-dehydrogenase isozyme 2 (HSD11B2) and its reversible action counterpart HSD11B1. Notably, its transport across cellular barriers involves multiple transporters including P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1) and various solute carriers, while primarily being carried in the bloodstream by serum albumin (ALB).

## Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic factors play a significant role in the variability of dexamethasone efficacy and safety. The metabolism of dexamethasone by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 suggests genetic variations in these genes could impact drug levels and effects. Individuals with specific polymorphisms in the CYP3A4 or CYP3A5 genes may exhibit altered metabolism rates, potentially requiring dose adjustments. Additionally, variations in the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) could influence the sensitivity and response to dexamethasone, impacting its therapeutic efficacy and risk of side effects. While specific pharmacogenetic testing is not routinely performed before starting dexamethasone, awareness of potential gene-drug interactions is crucial in personalized medicine to optimize treatment outcomes and minimize adverse effects.
