## Drug Summary
Isosorbide dinitrate, known under various brand names such as Carvasin, Flindix, Isoket, Isorbid, Nitrosorbide, and Sorbidilat, is an organic nitrate primarily used in the treatment and prevention of angina pectoris related to coronary artery disease. The drug acts as a vasodilator, with pharmacological effects akin to nitroglycerin but exhibiting a slower onset of action. The pharmacodynamics involve relaxation of vascular smooth muscle through a cascade of nitric oxide-catalyzed transformations, promoting venous pooling which results in reduced preload and myocardial oxygen demand. Pharmacokinetic characteristics indicate that isosorbide dinitrate undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism with highly variable oral bioavailability (10 to 90%), which typically averages around 25%.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
The mode of action of Isosorbide dinitrate is mediated principally through the NPR1 (Atrial natriuretic peptide receptor 1) target, wherein it promotes smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation by increasing intracellular concentrations of cGMP. This process triggers a series of phosphorylation leading to smooth muscle relaxation. The drugâ€™s metabolism predominantly involves the enzyme CYP2E1, a member of the cytochrome P450 family, which plays a critical role in its hepatic clearance. There are no specific transporters or carriers associated directly with the drug action or pharmacokinetic profile as provided.

## Pharmacogenetics
There is minimal direct pharmacogenetic data available for isosorbide dinitrate from the provided corpus. However, given that metabolism is primarily mediated by CYP2E1, genetic variations in this enzyme could hypothetically influence the drug's clearance and efficacy. Polymorphisms in the CYP2E1 gene have been associated with various alterations in enzyme activity in different populations, which may affect the metabolism of drugs. Further comprehensive genetic studies could help elucidate the extent to which CYP2E1 variants may impact the therapeutic outcomes or side-effect profiles in patients treated with isosorbide dinitrate. However, no specific pharmacogenetic recommendations or guidelines are currently established for this drug based on genomic data.
