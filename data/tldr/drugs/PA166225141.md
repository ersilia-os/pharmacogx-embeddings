## Drug Summary
Tucatinib is a kinase inhibitor specifically designed for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Classified as a HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, tucatinib is used in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine, addressing patients who have advanced unresectable or metastatic disease and have received prior anti-HER2 regimens. Approved by the FDA in April 2020, it also holds an accelerated approval in combination with trastuzumab for RAS wild-type HER2-positive metastatic colorectal cancer after progression on standard therapies. Tucatinib acts by inhibiting the tyrosine kinase activity of the HER2 receptor, which is essential for the oncogenic signaling in HER2-driven cancers. It is absorbed within 1 to 4 hours post-administration, with a peak concentration (Cmax) observed at about 1120 ng/mL when dosed at 350 mg twice daily. Metabolism predominantly occurs via CYP2C8 with some contribution from CYP3A enzymes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Tucatinib's action mechanism involves inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity associated with the HER2 (ERBB2) and HER3 (ERBB3) receptors. This inhibition reduces HER2-mediated signaling pathways, notably impacting the MAPK and AKT pathways involved in cell proliferation, thus exhibiting marked anti-tumor effects. The drugâ€™s metabolism involves multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly CYP2C8, and to a lesser extent CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, and CYP3A43. Tucatinib is also a substrate for several transport proteins including ABCG2 (BCRP), ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), and solute carriers such as SLC22A2, SLC47A1 (MATE1), and SLC47A2 (MATE2).

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of tucatinib may involve genetic variations influencing its pharmacokinetics and dynamics, particularly polmorphisms in genes encoding its metabolizing enzymes and transport proteins. Variants in CYP2C8 and CYP3A family members could potentially alter tucatinib's metabolism, affecting its efficacy and toxicity profile. Moreover, polymorphisms in transport proteins such as ABCG2, ABCB1, SLC22A2, and the MATE proteins might impact drug absorption and disposition. Though specific pharmacogenetic data for tucatinib are not detailed extensively, knowledge from related compounds suggests potential variability in patient response due to genetic variations. Further studies and clinical pharmacogenomic profiling could enhance the personalized therapeutic strategies involving tucatinib, ensuring optimal dosing regimens and minimizing adverse effects while maximizing efficacy in genetically diverse populations.
