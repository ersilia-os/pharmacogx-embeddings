## Drug Summary
Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter essential in vertebrates, playing a major role at various sites including neuromuscular junctions, autonomic ganglia, parasympathetic and some sympathetic effector junctions, and numerous regions within the central nervous system. Given its rapid degradation by cholinesterases, ACh is not commonly used as an administered drug but finds specialized use in ophthalmological procedures. Specifically, it is utilized to induce rapid miosis during surgeries such as cataract extraction, penetrating keratoplasty, and iridectomy. Information on its absorption, metabolism, and toxicity when used as a drug seems limited due to its brief functional duration in the body.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
ACh acts primarily through muscarinic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM2, CHRM3, CHRM4) which are G-protein coupled receptors influencing various physiological effects, and nicotinic receptors (CHRNA7), which are ionotropic receptors affecting the CNS and neuromuscular junctions. Its swift breakdown is facilitated by enzymes such as acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) which is crucial for terminating synaptic transmission at cholinergic synapses, and butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE), which serves a similar function. Additionally, it is transported via solute carriers like SLC22A5 (OCTN2) and SLC22A1 (OCT1), which are involved in cation transport that may impact its distribution and systemic presence.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of ACh involves the genetic variants of the enzymes ACHE and BCHE that can alter enzyme activity and thus influence the breakdown rate of ACh, potentially modifying its physiological effects. Variants in genes encoding ACh's receptors such as CHRM1, CHRM2, CHRM3, CHRM4, and CHRNA7 can alter receptor function, affecting everything from neuromuscular control to cognitive and autonomic processes. Polymorphisms in transporter genes like SLC22A5 and SLC22A1 could influence the efficacy and side effect profiles of administered ACh or ACh-enhancing drugs by altering the transportation efficiency of ACh or similar compounds. Given the importance of these genetic factors, understanding individual genetic variations can be crucial in predicting responses to drugs affecting the cholinergic system, although specific pharmacogenomic data for administered ACh is not extensively documented.
