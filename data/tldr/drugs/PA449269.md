## Drug Summary
Dextroamphetamine, also known under brand names such as Attentin and Dexamphetamine, is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant primarily used for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). It is the dextrorotatory enantiomer of amphetamine and was approved by the FDA in 2001. Dextroamphetamine acts through multiple mechanisms including promoting the release of dopamine, inhibiting its reuptake, and possibly altering the number of dopamine transporters in the synaptic clefts, especially within the striatum. The drug has variable bioavailability and its pharmacokinetics are not influenced by food intake. Metabolism occurs primarily in the liver mediated by cytochrome P450 2D6, producing metabolites such as 4-hydroxyamphetamine.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Dextroamphetamine interacts with several targets including the SLC6A3 (Sodium-dependent dopamine transporter), SLC6A2 (Sodium-dependent noradrenaline transporter), and SLC18A2 (Synaptic vesicular amine transporter) which are crucial for its CNS stimulant effects. Additionally, it affects multiple adrenergic receptors including ADRA1B, ADRA1A, ADRA1D, ADRA2A, ADRA2B, and ADRA2C, contributing to its sympathomimetic effects such as increased blood pressure and weak bronchodilation. The drug is transported primarily by SLC6A3 and metabolized by enzymes such as CYP2D6 and is known to interact with the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), which may play a role in its mechanism of action.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of dextroamphetamine primarily revolves around the CYP2D6 enzyme, which metabolizes the drug in the liver. Variability in the CYP2D6 gene can affect the metabolism of dextroamphetamine, influencing both its efficacy and toxicity. Individuals with multiple copies of the CYP2D6 gene (ultrarapid metabolizers) may metabolize the drug too quickly, potentially reducing drug effectiveness, while those with reduced or no functional CYP2D6 activity (poor metabolizers) may have increased exposure to the drug, raising the risk of side effects. Additionally, genetic variants in dopaminergic system genes, such as those encoding dopamine transporters and receptors (e.g., SLC6A3, DRD2), could potentially influence response variability to dextroamphetamine treatment in ADHD, although specific pharmacogenetic guidelines for dextroamphetamine based on these variants are not yet well-established.
