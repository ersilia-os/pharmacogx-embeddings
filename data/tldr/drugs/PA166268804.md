## Drug Summary
Mobocertinib, marketed under the brand name Exkivity, is a kinase inhibitor specifically designed to target human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This drug is utilized predominantly in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) associated with exon 20 insertion mutations in the EGFR gene, which often leads to resistance against standard EGFR inhibitors and generally harbors a worse prognosis. Mobocertinib was notably granted accelerated approval by the FDA in September 2021 for use in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients who have demonstrated progression post-platinum-based chemotherapy. As an oral capsule with a bioavailability of 37%, it achieves maximum plasma concentration about 4 hours after intake. It's important to monitor patients for QTc prolongation, a notable side effect, especially in those taking concurrent QTc-prolonging or CYP3A inhibiting drugs.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Mobocertinib acts primarily through binding and inhibition of the EGFR, particularly targeting the exon 20 insertion mutations. These mutations are less responsive to traditional EGFR inhibitors, making mobocertinib a valuable treatment for this subset of NSCLC. Regarding its metabolism, mobocertinib is predominantly broken down by CYP3A enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7), with the generation of two active metabolites, AP32960 and AP32914, which together contribute significantly to its pharmacological activity. It is also affiliated with key transporters including ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1) and ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2), which might play roles in its distribution and efflux.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of mobocertinib is particularly centered around its efficacy in NSCLC patients harboring the specific EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. This genetic specificity defines the targeted patient population for this therapy. Moreover, the metabolism by the CYP3A enzymes suggests potential pharmacogenetic considerations, as genetic variants influencing CYP3A activity could alter mobocertinib's pharmacokinetics and effects. For instance, polymorphisms in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 could potentially affect drug levels and efficacy. Additionally, genetic variations in transporter genes like ABCB1 and ABCG2 might modulate drug absorption and disposition, influencing both the therapeutic outcomes and toxicity profile. Monitoring genetic variability in these genes might be crucial for optimizing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing adverse effects.
