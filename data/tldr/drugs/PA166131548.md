## Drug Summary
Noroxymorphone is a major active metabolite of oxymorphone, an opioid analgesic primarily used for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. As a metabolite, noroxymorphone itself plays a crucial role in the pharmacodynamics of opioid drugs by contributing to their overall analgesic effects. Its activity is predominantly attributed to its interaction with the mu-opioid receptor, similar to other opioids, which results in its analgesic properties. Noroxymorphone’s pharmacokinetics involves primarily renal excretion, and it is a compound with potential implications in the field of pain management and opioid pharmacotherapy.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Details specific to the interaction of noroxymorphone with various targets, enzymes, transporters, and carriers are not extensively documented. However, given its derivation from oxymorphone, it is likely to share similar pharmacological targets, especially the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) which plays a critical role in mediating its analgesic effects. Noroxymorphone might be involved in pathways similar to those of its precursor, which include metabolism primarily in the liver and excretion via the kidneys. The activities of common opioid-metabolizing enzymes and transporters can be speculated to influence its pharmacokinetic profile.

## Pharmacogenetics
Specific pharmacogenetic information on noroxymorphone is scarce, but its activity can be inferred from its precursor, oxymorphone. Variations in genes such as CYP2D6, which influence opioid metabolism, might play a role in the pharmacokinetics of noroxymorphone. Moreover, genetic variations affecting the opioid receptors (e.g., OPRM1), could alter the drug’s efficacy and patient susceptibility to side effects. Additionally, polymorphisms in drug transporters and other metabolizing enzymes could influence the overall response and toxicity profiles in different populations. Although direct evidence linking genetic variants to noroxymorphone responsiveness and toxicity is lacking, such associations are common in opioid pharmacogenetics and warrant consideration for personalized therapy.
