## Drug Summary
Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that belongs to the propionic acid class of medications. It was developed in the early 1960s as a safer alternative to aspirin. Ibuprofen is commonly used as an over-the-counter medication to reduce fever, alleviate pain, and combat inflammation. Its effectiveness makes it a popular choice for the symptomatic treatment of conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, dental pain, and dysmenorrhea, as well as for managing mild to moderate pain. The drug works primarily through the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2), thus reducing the synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes, which are mediators of inflammation and pain.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Ibuprofen acts primarily by inhibiting the enzymes COX-1 and COX-2, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, which plays a central role in pain, fever, and inflammation. Apart from these, ibuprofen also affects various other targets such as BCL2 (an apoptosis regulator), PTGS2, and several peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), which may contribute to its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. It is metabolized mainly in the liver, involving cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19, which are crucial for producing its hydroxylated and carboxylated metabolites. Additionally, the drug's pharmacokinetics are influenced by various transporters like ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) and several SLC family members, which affect its absorption and elimination. It is also known to bind significantly to serum albumin.

## Pharmacogenetics
Variations in genes encoding the enzymes responsible for ibuprofen metabolism, particularly CYP2C9, can influence individual responses to the drug. Polymorphisms in CYP2C9 might affect the rate at which ibuprofen is metabolized, leading to variations in drug levels and effects. This can impact both the efficacy and the risk of adverse effects. For example, individuals with certain CYP2C9 alleles may process ibuprofen more slowly, potentially leading to increased exposure from standard doses. This aspect of interindividual variability is critical in personalized medicine, helping to guide dosing to maximize efficacy while minimizing adverse effects. There is also ongoing research exploring the implications of genetic variations in COX-1 and COX-2 genes on the pain-relieving effects of ibuprofen, which could further tailor ibuprofen therapy to individual genetic profiles.
