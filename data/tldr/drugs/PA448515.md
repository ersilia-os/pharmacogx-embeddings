## Drug Summary
Azathioprine, marketed under names such as Azamun, Azanin, Imurek, and Imurel, is an immunosuppressive prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine. It was first synthesized in 1956 and aims to exhibit a better therapeutic index than its parent compound. The drug is primarily utilized to treat chronic inflammatory ailments like rheumatoid arthritis and to prevent rejection in renal transplantation. Its mechanism of action is multifaceted, involving the inhibition of purine synthesis, consequently suppressing both B and T cell function. Azathioprine is orally administered and well-absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring around 1-2 hours post-administration. Its metabolism is complex, involving nonenzymatic conversion to 6-mercaptopurine and further enzymatic transformations to active metabolites. Due to its narrow therapeutic index, careful monitoring of therapy is required to balance efficacy and toxicity.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Azathioprine acts primarily through modulating the activity of the RAC1 protein, which plays a role in the apoptosis of T cells. Upon absorption, azathioprine is nonenzymatically converted to 6-mercaptopurine and then further metabolized by various enzymes including thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), xanthine oxidase (XDH), and several others involved in purine rheumetabolism like hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT1) and inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH1, IMPDH2). Key transporters include ABCB1 and SLC transporters like SLC29A2 and SLC28A3, facilitating the cellular and tissue distribution of the drug and its metabolites. The principal carrier identified is serum albumin (ALB), which may play a role in its systemic circulation.

## Pharmacogenetics
Azathioprine is noteworthy in pharmacogenetics primarily due to its interaction with the TPMT enzyme. Genetic polymorphisms in TPMT, notably alleles like *2, *3A, and *3C, significantly influence the drug's toxicity profile. Individuals with reduced or absent TPMT activity, as indicated by genotypes including rs1800462, rs1800460, and rs1142345, tend to have higher concentrations of the active thioguanine nucleotides, increasing the risk of severe myelosuppression and other toxic effects. Genotyping patients for TPMT polymorphisms before initiating therapy can help in tailoring the dose to achieve effectiveness while minimizing adverse effects. Additional pharmacogenetic considerations involve other enzymes like NUDT15 and xanthine oxidase, impacting drug metabolism and response.
