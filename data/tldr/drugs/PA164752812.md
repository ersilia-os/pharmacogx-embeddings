## Drug Summary
Milnacipran, known under various brand names like Dalcipran, Ixel, and Toledomin, is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). Originally developed for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), milnacipran is also FDA-approved since 2009 for managing fibromyalgia in adults. The drug acts by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin (5HT) and norepinephrine (NE), which are believed to enhance the presence of these neurotransmitters at synaptic clefts, influencing mood and pain perception. Milnacipran demonstrates a balanced reuptake inhibition but has a slightly higher preference for norepinephrine, which is significant in pain management via descending inhibitory pain pathways. The pharmacokinetics reveals that milnacipran is well-absorbed orally with a bioavailability of 85-90%, reaching steady-state within 36-48 hours.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Milnacipran primarily targets serotonin and norepinephrine transporters (SLC6A4 and SLC6A2 respectively), inhibiting their reuptake which enhances neurotransmitter levels and subsequently aids in the treatment of fibromyalgia and depression. It also interacts with NMDA receptors (GRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN2C, GRIN2D, GRIN3A, GRIN3B), indicating that it may modulate glutamatergic neurotransmission. While primarily metabolized via desethylation and hydroxylation forming metabolites that conjugate with glucuronide, the main enzyme involved is cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), with minor contributions from CYP2C8, 2C19, 2D6, and 2J2. No significant interactions with other neurotransmitter transporters or receptors are noted.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of milnacipran is primarily concerned with its metabolism involving CYP3A4. Variability in CYP3A4 activity could influence milnacipran's plasma levels and side effect profile, though specific pharmacogenetic markers have not been conclusively identified in public databases for milnacipran. Given the drug's metabolism by multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes, genetic polymorphisms in these enzymes could potentially alter drug efficacy and tolerance, necessitating adjusted dosages or alternative therapies in patients with specific genotypes. However, detailed pharmacogenomic data specific to milnacipran remains limited, and further research would be beneficial to optimize personalized treatment plans based on genetic profiles.
