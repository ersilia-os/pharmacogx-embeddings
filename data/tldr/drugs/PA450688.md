## Drug Summary
Olanzapine, sold under various brand names including Aedon, Amulsin, and Lanzapin, is a thienobenzodiazepine classified as an atypical or second-generation antipsychotic. It was developed by Eli Lilly and approved by the FDA in 1996. This drug is used mainly for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder, addressing symptoms like delusions, hallucinations, and acute manic episodes. Olanzapine works primarily by antagonizing various neurotransmitter receptors including dopamine and serotonin, reducing symptoms of psychosis and stabilizing mood. Pharmacokinetically, it has a linear profile with peak plasma concentrations reached about 6 hours post-dose, and it achieves steady state within a week. Olanzapine's metabolism predominantly occurs in the liver, facilitated by the CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 enzymes.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Olanzapine exerts its effects through the antagonism of multiple neurotransmitter receptors, key among these are the dopamine (D2, D1, D3, D4, D5) and serotonin (5HT2A, 5HT2C, 5HT3, 5HT6, 5HT1A, 5HT1B, etc.) receptors. It also influences other receptors like the histamine H1 and various muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Key enzymes involved in the metabolism of olanzapine include CYP1A2, CYP2D6, FMO3, CYP2C19, and UGT1A4. The drug is a substrate for the ABCB1 transporter, impacting its distribution and excretion. Olanzapine also interacts with serum proteins such as albumin (ALB) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (ORM1), which can influence its pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of olanzapine is influenced by genetic variations within the genes encoding its metabolic enzymes and target receptors. Particularly, polymorphisms in the CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 genes can significantly affect the drug's metabolism, potentially altering efficacy and risk of side effects. For instance, patients with reduced CYP2D6 activity may experience higher plasma levels of olanzapine, increasing the risk of adverse effects. The presence of the rs6295 polymorphism in the HTR1A gene is associated with a higher level of efficacy in improving negative symptoms of schizophrenia in patients treated with olanzapine. Thus, understanding the patient's genetic makeup can be crucial for optimizing therapy with olanzapine, minimizing side effects, and maximizing therapeutic efficacy.
