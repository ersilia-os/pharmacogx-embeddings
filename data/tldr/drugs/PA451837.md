## Drug Summary
Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), also known as ursodiol, is a naturally occurring bile acid used primarily to treat liver diseases such as primary biliary cholangitis and conditions related to gallstones. Approved by the FDA in 1987 for the dissolution of gallstones and in 1996 for primary biliary cirrhosis, UDCA modifies the bile acid pool by replacing more hydrophobic or toxic bile acids, reducing the risk of liver damage. It acts through various notable mechanisms including decreasing cholesterol absorption in the intestine, inhibiting secretion of cholesterol into bile, and stimulating bile acid secretion. Additionally, UDCA possesses cytoprotective, immunomodulatory, and choleretic effects.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
UDCA interacts with several biological proteins to exert its effects. Key targets include the bile acid receptor NR1H4 (farnesoid X receptor, FXR), which mediates effects on bile acid regulation, and AKR1C2, involved in steroid metabolism. UDCA is metabolized in the liver primarily via conjugation with amino acids like glycine or taurine, involving enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP3A43, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7. It impacts various transporters including ABCB11 (bile salt export pump), SLCO1A2, and SLC10A1 (sodium/bile acid cotransporter), which facilitate its effects on bile flow and cholesterol levels. These interactions help reduce toxicity and enhance the excretion of harmful bile acids.

## Pharmacogenetics
Ursodeoxycholic acidâ€™s pharmacogenetic profile is underexplored; however, its metabolism by members of the cytochrome P450 3A subfamily suggests potential genetic influences on its pharmacokinetics and response. Variants in these enzymes (e.g., CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 polymorphisms) may affect the rate of UDCA metabolism and conjugation, thus impacting its efficacy and safety. Furthermore, genetic variations in bile acid transporters like ABCB11 and SLC10A1 could modify treatment responses or risks of adverse effects. These aspects underscore the importance of further genetic studies to optimize therapy with UDCA involving personalized approaches.
