## Drug Summary
Lurasidone, marketed under trade names such as Latuda, is an atypical antipsychotic developed by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma. It received FDA approval for treating schizophrenia in 2010 and for bipolar depression as monotherapy or combined with lithium or valproate in adults. This benzothiazol derivative exhibits high affinity for dopamine D2, serotonin 5-HT2A, and 5-HT7 receptors, with moderate affinity for alpha-2C adrenergic receptors and partial agonism at 5-HT1A receptors. Notably, it has minimal action on histaminergic and muscarinic receptors, which partly explains its favorable side effect profile compared to typical antipsychotics. Lurasidone is readily absorbed, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1-4 hours post-ingestion, particularly when taken with food which significantly enhances its bioavailability (9-19%).

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Lurasidone acts primarily through antagonism at the D2 (dopamine receptor), 5-HT2A, and 5-HT7 (serotonin receptors), while also showing partial agonism at the 5-HT1A receptor. Its mechanism of action involves balancing the effects of dopamine and serotonin in the brain, contributing to its efficacy in improving cognitive and negative symptoms of psychosis while minimizing typical antipsychotic side effects. The drug is metabolized predominantly by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), which produces a major active metabolite, ID-14283, accounting for about 25% of the parent's exposure. There are also minor metabolites ID14326 and ID11614, plus non-active metabolites ID-20219 and ID-20220. No specific transporters or carriers are implicated in its pharmacokinetics based on the provided data.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of Lurasidone primarily involves the enzyme CYP3A4 for its metabolism. Variation within the CYP3A4 gene could influence Lurasidone plasma levels and subsequently its efficacy and safety profile. Patients with certain genetic variants in CYP3A4 might experience different pharmacokinetics leading to increased susceptibility to side effects or reduced drug effectiveness. This emphasis on CYP3A4 could similarly infer potential interactions with other medications processed by this enzyme, necessitating dose adjustments or careful monitoring of plasma drug levels in polypharmacy contexts. Currently, the genomic data lacks specific genetic markers linked to Lurasidone responses, but typical CYP3A4 variability could indicate pharmacogenetic implications warranting further research or consideration in clinical settings.
