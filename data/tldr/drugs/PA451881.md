## Drug Summary
Vinorelbine (variously known as Navelbin, Vinelbine, and several other trade names) is a semi-synthetic third-generation vinca alkaloid, primarily used for chemotherapy in a variety of cancers such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, and squamous cell head and neck cancer. Approved in the 1990s, vinorelbine operates as a mitotic inhibitor by interfering with tubulin polymerization which is crucial during cell division. Absorption of vinorelbine is rapid, with peak serum concentrations reached within two hours of administration. It is extensively bound to various proteins including alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, albumin, and lipoproteins. Metabolism occurs primarily in the liver through the cytochrome P450 system, predominantly CYP3A4, producing metabolites such as deacetylvinorelbine that retain antitumor activity.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Vinorelbine targets the Tubulin beta chain (TUBB), disrupting microtubule formation, which is necessary for cell division, particularly affecting the G2/M phases of the cell cycle. This action results in the disruption of mitotic processes. The drug's metabolism is mediated notably by hepatic enzymes including CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, members of the cytochrome P450 family, which are crucial in its biotransformation. According to the available data, vinorelbine doesn’t interact specifically with any transporters or carriers, focusing its actions primarily on microtubules within the cells.

## Pharmacogenetics
Vinorelbine displays variability in its pharmacokinetics influenced by genetic factors. Polymorphic variations in CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 can significantly affect the drug’s clearance and overall metabolism, impacting both its efficacy and toxicity profile. A study cited presents a 4.3-fold variation in vinorelbine clearance, highlighting the influence of genetic differences in drug handling. These genetic variations can necessitate dose adjustments and can predict responses to the drug, making pharmacogenetic information potentially useful for individualizing treatment plans in chemotherapy. Given the role of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in metabolizing vinorelbine, inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes might also influence the drug’s activity, interplaying with genetic predispositions to modify treatment outcomes.
