## Drug Summary
Lonafarnib, marketed under the name Sarasar among others, is a farnesyltransferase inhibitor primarily used in the treatment of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), a rare and often fatal condition characterized by symptoms resembling accelerated aging. Approved by the FDA in 2020, lonafarnib is the first treatment indicated for patients aged 12 months and older to reduce HGPS mortality risks. It is also effective against certain laminopathies associated with _LMNA_ mutations or abnormalities in _ZMPSTE24_. The drug acts by inhibiting the enzyme farnesyltransferase, reducing the farnesylation of progerin and other proteins implicated in HGPS and related disorders. Lonafarnib generally exhibits a pharmacokinetic profile characterized by a median time to peak concentration of 2-4 hours post-administration, with notable involvement of CYP3A enzymes in its metabolism.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Lonafarnib specifically targets and inhibits the enzymes farnesyltransferase subunits FNTA and FNTB, crucial for the post-translational modification of proteins including progerin. The drug is metabolized predominantly by cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, along with contributions from CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2A6, and CYP2E1. This extensive involvement of multiple CYP enzymes highlights its complex metabolic profile. Additionally, lonafarnib interacts with various transporters like ABCB1, SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, ABCG2, and ABCC2, which could affect its distribution and elimination, and may also impact its bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of lonafarnib involves significant interactions with genes encoding for its metabolizing enzymes and transport proteins. Variability in the activity of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, known to exhibit polymorphic expression, can influence lonafarnib's metabolism and subsequently its efficacy and toxicity profile. For instance, individuals with polymorphisms leading to reduced CYP3A4 activity may experience higher plasma concentrations of lonafarnib, increasing the risk of adverse effects, whereas those with highly active CYP3A5 might clear the drug more rapidly, potentially reducing its effectiveness. The transporters such as ABCB1 and SLCO1B1 also exhibit genetic variability that could affect the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of lonafarnib. Given the critical role of these genotypic variations, tailored dosing or alternative therapies might be considered based on genetic testing to optimize treatment outcomes and minimize risks.
