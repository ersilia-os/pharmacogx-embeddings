## Drug Summary
Metamizole, also known by other names such as Analgin and Novalgin, is a pyrazolone derivative used primarily as a potent analgesic and antipyretic. The drug is characterized by favorable gastrointestinal tolerability compared to other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, its mechanism is distinct and not fully understood, involving metabolites that possibly inhibit prostaglandin-induced hyperalgesia. Despite its effectiveness, metamizole has been banned or restricted in several countries due to the risk of causing agranulocytosis, a severe and potentially fatal reduction in neutrophil count. Its pharmacokinetics reveal rapid hydrolysis into its active form, principally absorbed as 4-methyl-amino-antipyrine (MAA), with bioavailability varying based on the administration route.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Metamizole's primary pharmacological target is suggested to be the cyclooxygenase enzyme COX-3, leading to analgesic effects that may also involve inhibition at the level of COX-2 in the central nervous system. The metabolism of metamizole involves its conversion to active metabolites by enzymes predominantly within the liver. Cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP3A4 play a significant role in this process, with contributions from CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C9. These enzymes facilitate the biotransformation of MAA to other metabolites like 4-amino-antipyrine (AA) and 4-formyl-amino-antipyrine (FAA), which are further processed in the body.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic profile of metamizole is influenced by variations in the genes encoding for its metabolizing enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Variants in these genes can affect the speed and efficiency of drug metabolism, potentially altering efficacy and risk profiles for adverse effects such as agranulocytosis. While specific pharmacogenetic data for metamizole is limited, understanding these genetic influences is crucial for tailoring treatments and minimizing risks in populations that still use the drug. Furthermore, the severe side effect of agranulocytosis has been linked to the development of drug-dependent anti-neutrophil antibodies, hinting at a complex immunogenetic mechanism that may have genetic predispositions.
