## Drug Summary
Cotinine is the primary metabolite of nicotine, formed in the liver through the action of cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP2A6. As an alkaloid found in tobacco, cotinine is used primarily as a biomarker to measure exposure to tobacco smoke. While it itself is less pharmacologically active compared to nicotine, its presence in bodily fluids is a reliable indicator of recent nicotine use due to its longer half-life, allowing for detection for days after nicotine intake.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Cotinine does not have well-defined targets like its parent compound nicotine, which acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The metabolism of cotinine is primarily facilitated by liver enzymes. The key enzyme involved in the metabolic pathway is CYP2A6, which converts nicotine to cotinine. Furthermore, cotinine is further metabolized into other metabolites, though the detailed pathways and involved enzymes are less characterized compared to nicotine metabolism.

## Pharmacogenetics
Cotinine pharmacogenetics is largely influenced by variations in the CYP2A6 gene. Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2A6 can lead to varying metabolic rates of nicotine and subsequently cotinine. CYP2A6 slow metabolizers might experience prolonged clearance times of cotinine, impacting nicotine dependence and withdrawal timelines. These genetic factors are crucial for understanding individual differences in tobacco addiction and cessation success, and they have been explored in smoking cessation therapies where nicotine metabolic profiling can guide personalized treatment decisions.
