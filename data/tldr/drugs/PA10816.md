## Drug Summary
Ezetimibe, known under brand names such as Ezedoc, Ezetib, and Zient, is a lipid-lowering medication primarily used to treat various forms of hyperlipidemia. It is distinct from other cholesterol-lowering agents like statins and bile acid sequestrants, as it specifically inhibits the intestinal absorption of cholesterol without affecting the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and nutrients. Ezetimibe is effective when used alone or in combination with other agents such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) or fenofibrate. The pharmacodynamics of ezetimibe show significant reductions in LDL cholesterol and modest increases in HDL cholesterol. Its absorption is minimally affected by food, achieving peak plasma concentrations a few hours after administration. The drug is extensively metabolized in the small intestine and liver primarily via glucuronidation to its active metabolite ezetimibe-glucuronide.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Ezetimibe's mechanism of action revolves around the inhibition of the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein, which is essential in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol. By blocking NPC1L1, ezetimibe prevents the incorporation of cholesterol into enterocytes, thus reducing hepatic cholesterol stores and increasing cholesterol clearance from the bloodstream. Enzymatically, ezetimibe is metabolized mainly by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes such as UGT1A1, UGT1A3, and UGT2B15. It's also subject to minimal oxidation by CYP3A4 and CYP2C8. Transporters involved include ABCB1 and SLCO1B1, among others, which play roles in the drug's distribution and excretion processes.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetic impact of ezetimibe involves several polymorphisms in the genes encoding its metabolic enzymes and transporters, which can influence its efficacy and safety profile. Variants in UGT1A1 and UGT2B15, for instance, affect the glucuronidation of ezetimibe and may alter drug levels and lipid-lowering effects. Additionally, polymorphisms in transporter genes such as SLCO1B1 and ABCB1 might impact the absorption and disposition of the drug, potentially modifying therapeutic outcomes or risk of adverse effects. The understanding of these genetic factors is crucial for personalized medication approaches, especially in polygenic hyperlipidemia cases or when used in combination therapies with statins, where genetic predispositions to myopathy and other side effects could be significant.
