## Drug Summary
Vinblastine is a vinca alkaloid antineoplastic agent used primarily in the chemotherapy of various cancers, including breast cancer, testicular cancer, lymphomas, neuroblastoma, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, mycosis fungoides, histiocytosis, and Kaposi's sarcoma. Structurally, vinblastine consists of two multiringed units, vindoline and catharanthine. Extracted initially from the periwinkle plant (*Catharanthus roseus*), its antineoplastic properties were discovered in 1959. Vinblastine inhibits mitosis at metaphase through disruption of microtubule formation, particularly by binding with tubulin, thus leading to cell death. It undergoes hepatic metabolism primarily via cytochrome P450 3A isoenzymes and has immunosuppressive effects.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Vinblastine primarily targets tubulin proteins involved in microtubule formation, including Tubulin alpha-1A chain (TUBA1A), Tubulin beta chain (TUBB), Tubulin delta chain (TUBD1), Tubulin gamma-1 chain (TUBG1), and Tubulin epsilon chain (TUBE1). It also affects the transcription factor AP-1 (JUN), which may contribute to its cytotoxic effects. Vinblastine is metabolized by liver enzymes Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). In terms of transport, it interacts with several transporters including P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1), Multidrug resistance-associated proteins (ABCC1, ABCC2, ABCC6), Bile salt export pump (ABCB11), and the Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (SLCO1B1).

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of vinblastine involves significant interactions with genetic variants of the metabolizing enzymes and transport proteins. Variants in CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 can influence the metabolism of vinblastine, potentially affecting its efficacy and toxicity. Individuals with certain polymorphisms in these enzymes might experience altered drug metabolism, leading to enhanced or reduced drug action and side effects. Additionally, genetic variations in transporters like ABCB1 and ABCC1 may affect the drug's distribution and elimination, impacting the therapeutic outcomes and adverse effects. While direct pharmacogenetic testing for vinblastine use is not commonly delineated, considering these genetic factors could be crucial in optimizing individual treatment plans and mitigating risks.
