## Drug Summary
Dextromethorphan, commonly known under brand names such as Benylin DM, Romilar, Triaminic, and Vicks Formula 44, is a levorphanol derivative and a codeine analog used primarily as a cough suppressant. It is used over-the-counter in the treatment of cough and upper respiratory symptoms associated with allergies or the common cold, often in combination with other medications like brompheniramine, pseudoephedrine, guaifenesin, and quinidine for pseudobulbar affect. Unlike typical opioids, its therapeutic effects are mediated through NMDA receptor antagonism rather than substantial interaction with opioid receptors. Pharmacokinetically, it has a moderate action window and duration, with a 30mg oral dose achieving a peak concentration within approximately 2.86 hours.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Dextromethorphan targets multiple receptors including NMDA and sigma-1 receptors (SIGMAR1), various subunits of neuronal acetylcholine receptors (e.g., CHRNA2, CHRNA3, CHRNA4, CHRNB2, CHRNB4), and potentially interacts with opioid receptors albeit minimally. The drug is metabolized predominantly by cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9 into active metabolites like dextrorphan and 3-methoxymorphinan, which are further metabolized or conjugated by glucuronidation (UGT2B4, UGT2B7, UGT2B15, UGT2B17). Notably, there are no specific transporters or carriers detailed for this drug.

## Pharmacogenetics
A significant aspect of dextromethorphan pharmacogenetics revolves around its metabolism by the CYP2D6 enzyme. Variability in the CYP2D6 gene can significantly affect the drug's processing, leading to different metabolizing statuses among individuals. For instance, alleles such as those represented by the rs3892097 and rs5030655 polymorphisms lead to reduced CYP2D6 enzyme activity, potentially increasing the risk of adverse effects or altered therapeutic efficacy due to higher levels of dextromethorphan. These genetic variations are crucial for tailoring individual treatment plans to prevent toxicity, especially in overdoses where symptoms can range from mild (nausea, vomiting) to severe (respiratory depression, coma, serotonin syndrome).
