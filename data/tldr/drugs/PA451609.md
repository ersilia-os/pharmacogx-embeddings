## Drug Summary
Temozolomide (TMZ) is an oral and intravenous alkylating agent used primarily in the treatment of high-grade gliomas, including glioblastoma multiforme and refractory anaplastic astrocytoma. It was approved by the FDA in 1999 for oral administration and in 2009 for intravenous use. Temozolomide is a prodrug that spontaneously converts into the active methylating agent at physiological pH, mainly affecting the brain where tumor tissue pH is more alkaline. This agent preferentially methylates guanine and adenine in DNA, causing cell death primarily through the induction of apoptosis. The drug shows complete gastrointestinal absorption, with its kinetics being linear across different dosages, and is minimally affected by the cytochrome P450 system. Generally, the toxicity profile of temozolomide includes myelosuppression, severe hepatotoxicity, and potential teratogenic effects, necessitating careful patient monitoring and management.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Although specific enzyme targets for temozolomide are not detailed in the provided database, the drug undergoes nonenzymatic conversion to its active metabolites in the body. It interacts with transporters such as ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein 1) and ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2), which may influence its distribution and excretion. Temozolomide also binds to carriers like albumin (ALB) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1), which could affect its pharmacokinetic properties including distribution and half-life, potentially influencing its efficacy and toxicity.

## Pharmacogenetics
The pharmacogenetics of temozolomide primarily revolves around its interaction with the DNA repair mechanisms of tumor cells. The key pharmacogenetic factor is the methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter methylation status. Glioblastomas lacking MGMT activity due to promoter methylation are particularly sensitive to temozolomide because they cannot repair the O6-methylguanine lesion effectively, leading to increased tumor cell death. Conversely, tumors with unmethylated MGMT promoters are generally resistant due to active repair of this lesion, which directly influences treatment outcomes and resistance. The effectiveness of temozolomide may also be influenced by polymorphic genetic variants of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway genes, although specific interactions or population data were not provided in the summary.
