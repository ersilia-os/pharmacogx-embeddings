## Drug Summary
Voxelotor, commercially known as Oxbryta, is an orally administered therapeutic agent categorized as a hemoglobin S polymerization inhibitor, specifically designed for the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD). This disease catalyzes the formation of atypically shaped red blood cells that impede normal blood flow, leading to severe pain, organ damage, and other complications. By increasing hemoglobin oxygen affinity, Voxelotor effectively mitigates the polymerization of deoxygenated sickle hemoglobin (HbS) which underpins the pathophysiology of SCD. It was expediently approved by the FDA in November 2019 and by the EMA in February 2022 for varying age groups depending on the geographical approval. Pharmacokinetically, voxelotor shows rapid oral absorption, with plasma peak (T_max) at approximately 2 hours post-administration, and its effect enhanced by high-fat meals. Voxelotor is extensively metabolized through both Phase I (involving CYP enzymes) and Phase II (glucuronidation) pathways.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Voxelotor primarily targets hemoglobin, specifically binding to the N-terminal valine of the α-chain of Hb, facilitating an allosteric modification that stabilizes the high-oxygen affinity state of the hemoglobin molecule. This process is vital in preventing the sickling of red blood cells in SCD patients. Metabolism of voxelotor is largely mediated by the cytochrome P450 system, with significant contributions from CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP2C19, CYP2B6, and CYP2C9. The drug's metabolic pathway includes both oxidation and reduction reactions followed by glucuronidation. Information on specific transporters or carriers directly involved in voxelotor's action or pharmacokinetics was not provided.

## Pharmacogenetics
In terms of pharmacogenetics, voxelotor treatment might be influenced by genetic variations existing within the genes encoding for its metabolizing enzymes. CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, and CYP2C19 are known to have multiple polymorphisms that can affect drug metabolism, potentially influencing the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of voxelotor. For example, variations in CYP3A4 activity might impact the levels and efficacy of voxelotor, given its major role in the drug’s metabolism. Patients with certain polymorphisms in CYP3A4 that result in reduced enzymatic activity could exhibit higher drug exposure, which might necessitate dosage adjustments. However, specific pharmacogenetic data linking these genetic variations to the clinical response or toxicity of voxelotor in SCD treatment has not been explicitly documented in the sources available, indicating an area for future research.
