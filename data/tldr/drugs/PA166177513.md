## Drug Summary
Mirabegron, known commercially as Betanis and Metmiga, is a beta-3 adrenergic receptor agonist used primarily to manage overactive bladder (OAB). Approved by the FDA in 2012 under the brand Myrbetriq, it offers a unique mechanism of action in the realm of OAB treatments by specifically targeting the beta-3 adrenergic receptors, promoting relaxation of bladder smooth muscle, and increasing bladder storage capacity. This differs from antimuscarinic agents that often come with broader adverse effects due to their extensive receptor interactions. Pharmacokinetically, mirabegron shows a bioavailability ranging from 29% to 35% depending on dosage, with a time-to-peak concentration of approximately 3.5 to 5 hours depending on the formulation. Metabolism involves pathways such as amide hydrolysis, glucuronidation, and possible CYP450 enzyme activity, mostly maintaining the parent drug as the primary circulating component.

## Drug Targets, Enzymes, Transporters, and Carriers
Mirabegron primarily targets the beta-3 adrenergic receptor (ADRB3), facilitating its therapeutic effects on bladder muscle relaxation. It also has lesser interactions with the beta-1 adrenergic receptor (ADRB1). The major enzymes involved in its metabolism are CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, which handle its oxidative metabolism, and several UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT2B7, UGT1A3, UGT1A8) which manage conjugation reactions. Additionally, butylcholinesterase (BCHE) may play a role. Transporters involved with mirabegron include P-glycoprotein 1 (ABCB1) and several members of the solute carrier family (SLCO1A2, SLC22A1, SLC22A2, SLC22A3). Carriers identified are serum albumin (ALB) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1), suggesting roles in drug distribution or plasma protein binding.

## Pharmacogenetics
Mirabegronâ€™s response and adverse effects may vary based on genetic differences in its metabolism and transport pathways. Important genetic considerations include variants in the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 genes, which could affect the rate and extent of drug metabolism and consequently its efficacy and safety profile. Variants in UGT enzymes might also modify glucuronidation processes, impacting drug clearance. The interaction with transporters like ABCB1 could be influenced by genetic variations, potentially altering drug distribution and excretion. Direct clinical implications are less clearly defined, but knowing these genetic variations can guide more personalized dosing and avoid adverse effects, ensuring a safer and more effective therapeutic response.
