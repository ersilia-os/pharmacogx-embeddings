Decreased function of this transporter (inherited through genetic variability or acquired through drug-mediated inhibition) can markedly increase the systemic exposure to statins, the putative causal factor underlying the link to SAMS. The SLCO1B1 gene locus occupies 109 kb on chromosome 12 (Chr 12p12.2) and, although many single nucleotide variants (SNVs) have been identified in this gene, only a few are known to have a clinically relevant functional impact (SLCO1B1 Allele Definition and Functionality Tables)&quot;.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;The most common and well-studied variant in SLCO1B1 is c.521T&gt;C (rs4149056), and can be genotyped alone (e.g., PCR-based single SNV assay) or multiplexed on a variety of array-based platforms. All SLCO1B1 genetic tests should interrogate c.521T&gt;C; however, while other less common variants in this gene may have limited evidence to guide action, they may also be important&quot;.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Download and read:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/statins/2022/publication.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guideline for SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9 and statin-associated musculoskeletal symptoms</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/statins/2022/supplement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2022 supplement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/page/slco1b1RefMaterials\">Gene-specific Information Tables for SLCO1B1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://api.pharmgkb.org/v1/preview/download/file/attachment/simvastatin-Drug_Resource_Mappings.xlsx\">Simvastatin Drug Resource Mappings</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://api.pharmgkb.org/v1/preview/download/file/attachment/Simvastatin_Pre_and_Post_Test_Alerts.xlsx\">Simvastatin Pre and Post Test Alerts</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/images/flow_chart/Simvastatin_CDS_Flow_Chart.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Simvastatin CDS Flow Chart</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"table-1-recommended-dosing-of-simvastatin-based-on-slco1b1-phenotype\">Table 1: Recommended dosing of simvastatin based on SLCO1B1 phenotype</h3>\n<p><em>Adapted from Table 1 and 2 of the 2022 guideline update manuscript.</em></p>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Phenotype</th>\n<th>Genotype</th>\n<th>Examples of diplotypes <sup>a</sup></th>\n<th>Implications for simvastatin</th>\n<th>Dosing recommendations for simvastatin <sup>b,c</sup></th>\n<th>Classification of recommendations <sup>d</sup></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Normal function</td>\n<td>An individual carrying two normal function alleles or one normal plus one increased function allele</td>\n<td>*1/*1, *1/*14</td>\n<td>Typical myopathy risk and statin exposure</td>\n<td>Prescribe desired starting dose and adjust doses based on disease-specific guidelines.</td>\n<td>Strong</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Increased function</td>\n<td>An individual carrying two increased function alleles</td>\n<td>*14/*14</td>\n<td>Typical myopathy risk and statin exposure</td>\n<td>Prescribe desired starting dose and adjust doses based on disease-specific guidelines.</td>\n<td>Strong</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Decreased function</td>\n<td>An individual carrying one normal or increased function allele plus one no function allele</td>\n<td>*1/*5, *1/*15</td>\n<td>Increased simvastatin acid exposure as compared to normal function; increased risk of myopathy</td>\n<td>Prescribe an alternative statin depending on the desired potency (see Figure 1 for recommendations for alternative statins).

The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association issued an updated clinical practice guideline for the management of blood cholesterol in 2018. In those guidelines, statins at various daily doses are classified as high-, medium- or low-intensity statins based on expected ranges of LDL-cholesterol lowering. For example, they recommend initiation of high-intensity statins in patients with evidence of clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) which may include atorvastatin at 40 or 80 mg once daily or rosuvastatin at 20 or 40 mg once daily.   Figure 1 is designed to be used in conjunction with the aforementioned guideline, as it provides statin recommendations, including preferred statin intensity and statin dose, stratified by SLCO1B1 phenotype (i.e., decreased or poor function). Statin and statin doses indicated in the light grey boxes can be prescribed with the lowest risk for SAMS. Statin and statin doses indicated in dark grey boxes should be used with caution (possible increased risk for SAMS) and statin and statin doses indicated in black boxes should be avoided as the available evidence suggests that they are associated with increased risk of harm. The recommendations are based on the combination of available pharmacokinetic and SAMS-risk data, in most cases, and are informed by the number of available statin options within each intensity.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"october-2014-update\">October 2014 Update</h3>\n<p><em>Advance online publication 9 July 2014.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/simvastatin/2014/24918167.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2014 update of CPIC guideline regarding SLCO1B1 and simvastatin-induced myopathy</a>, has been published in Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.  CPIC extensively reviewed the literature from February 2011 to December 2013 and concluded the dosing recommendations provided in the 2012 CPIC guideline for SLCO1B1 and simvastatin-induced myopathy have not changed. However, this updated guideline also provides a brief review regarding SLCO1B1 genotype and risk of myopathy for other statins.  Furthermore, comprehensive translation tables mapping SLCO1B1 genotypes to coded genotype/phenotype summaries, EHR priority result notation and interpretation (consultation) text were created to facilitate incorporation of SLCO1B1 pharmacogenetics into an electronic health record with clinical decision support.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This guideline is applicable to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>adult patients</li>\n<li>pediatric patients</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Excerpt from the 2014 simvastatin dosing guideline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;For simvastatin, the evidence linking myopathy to <a href=\"/variant/PA166154579\">rs4149056</a> in SLCO1B1 is of high quality, and this association has been reproduced in randomized trials and clinical practice-based cohorts. Conversely, the association of <a href=\"/variant/PA166154579\">rs4149056</a> with myopathy has been less compelling for other statins. We therefore focus this guideline on simvastatin.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&quot;In 2011 and updated in 2013, the FDA added warnings to the simvastatin product label to direct providers away from initiating at the 80 mg simvastatin dose. &quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;At lower simvastatin doses (e.g., 40 mg daily), it is our position that SLCO1B1 genotype (if available) could be used to warn providers about modest increases in myopathy risk for patients with a C allele at <a href=\"/variant/PA166154579\">rs4149056</a>. In these circumstances, we recommend a lower dose of simvastatin or use an alternative statin (e.g. pravastatin or rosuvastatin) and we also highlight the potential utility of routine CK surveillance (Table 2). If patients with a C allele at <a href=\"/variant/PA166154579\">rs4149056</a> do not achieve optimal LDL cholesterol-lowering efficacy with a lower dose (e.g. 20 mg) of simvastatin, we recommend the prescribing physician consider an alternate statin based on (i) potency differences (i.e., use a lower dose of a higher potency statin such as atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, or pitavastatin), (ii) drug-drug interactions (e.g., boceprevir, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, etc.), and (iii) relevant co-morbidities (e.g., trauma, significant renal impairment, post-solid organ transplant, thyroid disease etc.).&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;At the time of this writing, there are no data available regarding SLCO1B1 genotype effects on simvastatin response or myopathy in pediatric patient populations, although there is no reason to suspect that the polymorphisms in SLCO1B1 will affect simvastatin's metabolism differently in children compared to adults.&quot;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Download and read:\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/simvastatin/2014/24918167.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guideline for SLCO1B1 and simvastatin-induced myopathy: 2014 update</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/simvastatin/2014/24918167-supplement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2014 supplement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/page/slco1b1RefMaterials\">Gene-specific Information Tables for SLCO1B1</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"table-1-recommended-dosing-of-simvastatin-based-on-slco1b1-phenotype-1\">Table 1: Recommended dosing of simvastatin based on SLCO1B1 phenotype</h3>\n<p><em>Adapted from Table 1 and 2 of the 2014 guideline update manuscript.</em></p>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Phenotype</th>\n<th>Examples of diplotypes <sup>a</sup></th>\n<th>Genotype at <a href=\"/variant/PA166154579\">rs4149056</a></th>\n<th>Implications for simvastatin</th>\n<th>Dosing recommendations for simvastatin <sup>b,c</sup></th>\n<th>Classification of recommendations <sup>d</sup></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Normal function, Homozygous wild-type (two normal function alleles)</td>\n<td>*1a/*1a, *1a/*1b, *1b/*1b</td>\n<td>TT</td>\n<td>Normal myopathy risk</td>\n<td>Prescribe desired starting dose and adjust doses of simvastatin based on disease-specific guidelines.</td>\n<td>Strong</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Intermediate function, Heterozygous (one normal function allele plus one decreased function allele)</td>\n<td>*1a/*5, *1a/*15, *1a/*17, *1b/*5, *1b/*15, *1b/*17</td>\n<td>TC</td>\n<td>Intermediate myopathy risk</td>\n<td>Prescribe a lower dose or consider an alternative statin (e.g. pravastatin or rosuvastatin); consider routine CK surveillance.</td>\n<td>Strong</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Low function, Homozygous variant or mutant (two decreased function alleles)</td>\n<td>*5/*5, *5/*15, *5/*17, *15/*15, *15/*17, *17/*17</td>\n<td>CC</td>\n<td>High myopathy risk</td>\n<td>Prescribe a lower dose or consider an alternative statin (e.g. pravastatin or rosuvastatin); consider routine CK surveillance.</td>\n<td>Strong</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>CK, creatine kinase.</p>\n<p><sup>a</sup> SLCO1B1 alleles are often named using <a href=\"http://www.pharmgkb.org/gene/PA134865839#tabview=tab4&amp;subtab=33\">star allele nomenclature, representing various SNPs alone or in combination</a> (2014 Update Supplemental Table S1) that are associated with low SLCO1B1 protein expression or function (2014 Update Supplemental Table S2).
