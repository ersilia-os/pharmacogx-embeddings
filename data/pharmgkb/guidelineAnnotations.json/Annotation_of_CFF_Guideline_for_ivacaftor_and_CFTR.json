      "summary": "BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators are a new class of medications targeting the underlying defect in CF. Ivacaftor (IVA) and IVA combined with lumacaftor (LUM; IVA/LUM) have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients with CF. However, the FDA label for these medications encompasses patient groups that were not studied as part of the drug approval process. CF clinicians, patients, and their families have recognized a need for recommendations to guide the use of these medications.\n\nOBJECTIVE: Develop evidence-based guidelines for CFTR modulator therapy in patients with CF.\n\nMETHODS: A multidisciplinary committee of CF caregivers and patient representatives was assembled. A methodologist, an epidemiologist, a medical librarian, and a biostatistician were recruited to assist with the literature search, evidence grading, and generation of recommendations. The committee developed clinical questions using the Patient-Intervention-Comparison-Outcome format. A systematic review was conducted to find relevant publications. The evidence was then evaluated using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach, and recommendations were made based on this analysis.\n\nRESULTS: For adults and children aged 6 years and older with CF due to gating mutations other than G551D or R117H, the guideline panel made a conditional recommendation for treatment with IVA. For those with the R117H mutation, the guideline panel made a conditional recommendation for treatment with IVA for 1) adults aged 18 years or older, and 2) children aged 6-17 years with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) less than 90% predicted. For those with the R117H mutation, the guideline panel made a conditional recommendation against treatment with IVA for 1) children aged 12-17 years with an FEV 1 greater than 90% predicted, and 2) children less than 6 years of age. Among those with two copies of F508del, the guideline panel made a strong recommendation for treatment with IVA/LUM for adults and children aged 12 years and older with an FEV 1 less than 90% predicted; and made a conditional recommendation for treatment with IVA/LUM for 1) adults and children aged 12 years or older with an FEV 1 greater than 90% predicted, and 2) children aged 6-11 years.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Using the GRADE approach, we have made recommendations for the use of CFTR modulators in patients with CF. These recommendations will be of help to CF clinicians, patients, and their families in guiding decisions regarding use of these medications.",

      "summary": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) clinical care guidelines exist for the care of infants up to age 2 years and for individuals â‰¥6 years of age. An important gap exists for preschool children between the ages of 2 and 5 years. This period marks a time of growth and development that is critical to achieve optimal nutritional status and maintain lung health. Given that disease often progresses in a clinically silent manner, objective and sensitive tools that detect and track early disease are important in this age group. Several challenges exist that may impede the delivery of care for these children, including adherence to therapies. A multidisciplinary committee was convened by the CF Foundation to develop comprehensive evidence-based and consensus recommendations for the care of preschool children, ages 2 to 5 years, with CF. This document includes recommendations in the following areas: routine surveillance for pulmonary disease, therapeutics, and nutritional and gastrointestinal care.",

      "summary": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by abnormal airways secretions, chronic endobronchial infection, and progressive airway obstruction. The use of medications to slow the progression of lung disease has led to significant improvement in survival. An evidence review of chronic medications for CF lung disease was performed in 2007 to provide guidance to clinicians in evaluating and selecting appropriate treatment for individuals with this disease. We have undertaken a new review of the literature to update the recommendations, including consideration of new medications and additional evidence on previously reviewed therapies. A multidisciplinary committee of experts in CF pulmonary care was established to review the evidence for use of chronic medications for CF lung disease and make treatment recommendations. Published evidence for chronic lung therapies was systematically reviewed and resulting treatment recommendations were graded based on the United States Preventive Services Task Force scheme. These guidelines provide up-to-date evidence of safety and efficacy of chronic treatments of CF lung disease, including the use of novel therapies that have not previously been included in CF pulmonary guidelines.",
