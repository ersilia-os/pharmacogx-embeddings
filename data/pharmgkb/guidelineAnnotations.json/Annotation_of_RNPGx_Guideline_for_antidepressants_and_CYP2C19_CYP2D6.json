      "summary": "Tailoring antidepressant drug therapy to each individual patient is a complex process because these drugs have adverse effects leading to discontinuation. Pharmacogenetics may provide useful information in routine practice for optimizing antidepressant treatment by helping limit toxic effects while maintaining efficacy. This review presents the usefulness of pharmacogenetic tests for P450 cytochromes CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 in psychiatric patients taking antidepressants. Depending on the level of evidence, the French National Network of Pharmacogenetics (RNPGx) has issued recommendations stating that pharmacogenetic tests for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genes are potentially useful in psychiatric patients treated with antidepressant drugs.",
