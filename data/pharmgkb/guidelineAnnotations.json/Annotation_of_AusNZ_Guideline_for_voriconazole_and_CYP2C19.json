      "summary": "Antifungal agents can have complex dosing and the potential for drug interaction, both of which can lead to subtherapeutic antifungal drug concentrations and poorer clinical outcomes for patients with haematological malignancy and haemopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Antifungal agents can also be associated with significant toxicities when drug concentrations are too high. Suboptimal dosing can be minimised by clinical assessment, laboratory monitoring, avoidance of interacting drugs, and dose modification. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) plays an increasingly important role in antifungal therapy, particularly for antifungal agents that have an established exposure-response relationship with either a narrow therapeutic window, large dose-exposure variability, cytochrome P450 gene polymorphism affecting drug metabolism, the presence of antifungal drug interactions or unexpected toxicity, and/or concerns for non-compliance or inadequate absorption of oral antifungals. These guidelines provide recommendations on antifungal drug monitoring and TDM-guided dosing adjustment for selected antifungal agents, and include suggested resources for identifying and analysing antifungal drug interactions. Recommended competencies for optimal interpretation of antifungal TDM and dose recommendations are also provided.",

Dosing recommendations for voriconazole treatment from the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) and the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) for each CYP2C19 phenotype are summarised in Table 8. The population pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics model by Mangal et al. proposed voriconazole doses of 500–600mg 12-hourly without pantoprazole, or 400–450mg 12-hourly with pantoprazole, for aspergillosis treatment in adult CYP2C19 ultrarapid or rapid metabolisers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>If voriconazole concentrations remain subtherapeutic after two appropriate dose adjustments then this suggests the patient may be a rapid/ultrarapid metaboliser. In this case, we recommend considering a switch to an alternative antifungal agent and CYP2C19 genotype testing. However, if this is not clinically appropriate, consider increasing voriconazole frequency, and adding pantoprazole or omeprazole and/or cimetidine, as a CYP450 inhibitor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
