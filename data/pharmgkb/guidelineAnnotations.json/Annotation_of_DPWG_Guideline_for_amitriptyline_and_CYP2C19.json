They conclude that NO action is required for this gene-drug interaction, (see the <a download=\"DPWG_August_2019.pdf\" href=\"https://api.pharmgkb.org/v1/download/file/attachment/DPWG_August_2019.pdf\">Dutch guidelines August 2019 update</a>).</p>\n<p>For CYP2C19 IM and PM, the gene variation has an effect on the exposure to amitriptyline, but not on the exposure to amitriptyline + the active metabolite nortriptyline, which determines the effect and side effects. For CYP2C19 UM, the gene variation decreases the exposure to amitriptyline and increases the exposure to the active metabolite nortriptyline, but there is no evidence to indicate that this results in an increase in side effects or a decrease in efficacy. A higher dose is required to achieve the therapeutic range of amitriptyline+nortriptyline, but the therapeutic range of nortriptyline is achieved at the lower dose.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.g-standaard.nl/risicoanalyse/B0007026.PDF\" target=\"_blank\">Read for more information about this recommendation</a>, <a download=\"CYP2C19.pdf\" href=\"https://api.pharmgkb.org/v1/download/file/attachment/CYP2C19.pdf\">Read about gene information from DPWG</a></p>\n",
