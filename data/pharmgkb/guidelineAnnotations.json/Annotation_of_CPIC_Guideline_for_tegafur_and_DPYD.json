Therefore, reduction of fluoropyrimidine dosage in patients with these variants may prevent severe and possibly life-threatening toxicities. However, available evidence does not clearly indicate a degree of dose reduction needed to prevent fluoropyrimidine related toxicities...[Based on literature review (see full manuscript),] our recommendation is to start with at least a 50% reduction of the starting dose followed by an increase in dose in patients experiencing no or clinically tolerable toxicity to maintain efficacy, a decrease in dose in patients who do not tolerate the starting dose to minimize toxicities or pharmacokinetic guided dose adjustments (if available). Patients who are homozygous for DPYD*2A, *13, or <a href=\"/variant/PA166153895\">rs67376798</a> may demonstrate complete DPD deficiency and the use of 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine is not recommended in these patients.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Download and read:\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/fluoropyrimidines/2013/23988873.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium Guidelines for Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase Genotype and Fluoropyrimidine Dosing</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/fluoropyrimidines/2013/23988873-supplement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2013 supplement</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"table-1-recommended-dosing-of-fluoropyrimidines-by-genotype-phenotype\">Table 1: Recommended dosing of fluoropyrimidines by genotype/phenotype.</h3>\n<p><em>Adapted from Tables 1 and 2 of the 2013 guideline manuscript.</em></p>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Phenotype (genotype)</th>\n<th>Examples of diplotypes</th>\n<th>Implications for phenotypic measures</th>\n<th>Dosing recommendations</th>\n<th>Classification of recommendations <sup>a</sup></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Homozygous wild-type or normal, high DPD activity (two or more functional *1 alleles)</td>\n<td>*1/*1</td>\n<td>Normal DPD activity and &quot;normal&quot; risk for fluoropyrimidine toxicity</td>\n<td>Use label-recommended dosage and administration</td>\n<td>Moderate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Heterozygous or intermediate activity (~3-5% of patients), may have partial DPD deficiency, at risk for toxicity with drug exposure (one functional allele *1, plus one nonfunctional allele - *2A, *13 or rs67376798A <sup>c</sup>)</td>\n<td>*1/*2A; *1/*13; *1/ rs67376798A <sup>c</sup>)</td>\n<td>Decreased DPD activity (leukocyte DPD activity at 30% to 70% that of the normal population) and increased risk for severe or even fatal drug toxicity when treated with fluoropyrimidine drugs</td>\n<td>Start with at least a 50% reduction in starting dose followed by titration of dose based on toxicity <sup>b</sup> or pharmacokinetic test (if available)</td>\n<td>Moderate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Homozygous variant, DPD deficiency (~0.2% of patients), at risk for toxicity with drug exposure (2 nonfunctional alleles - *2A, *13 or rs67376798A <sup>c</sup>)</td>\n<td>*2A/*2A; *13/*13; rs67376798A <sup>c</sup> / rs67376798A <sup>c</sup></td>\n<td>Complete DPD deficiency and increased risk for severe or even fatal drug toxicity when treated with fluoropyrimidine drugs</td>\n<td>Select alternate drug</td>\n<td>Strong</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><sup>a</sup> Rating scheme described in 2013 supplement.</p>\n<p><sup>b</sup> Increase the dose in patients experiencing no or clinically tolerable toxicity to maintain efficacy; decrease the dose in patients who do not tolerate the starting dose to minimize toxicities.</p>\n<p><sup>c</sup> Note that the rs67376798A allele refers to the allele on the positive chromosomal strand.
