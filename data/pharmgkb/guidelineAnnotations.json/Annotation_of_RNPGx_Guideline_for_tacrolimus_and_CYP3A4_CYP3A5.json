This article summarizes evidence reported in the literature regarding the pharmacogenetics of (i) immunosuppressive drugs used in transplantation and (ii) azathioprine used in chronic inflammatory bowel disease. The conditions of use of currently available major pharmacogenetic tests are detailed and recommendations are provided based on a scale established by the RNPGx scoring tests as \"essential\", \"advisable\" and \"potentially useful\". Other applications for which the level of evidence is still debated are also discussed.",
