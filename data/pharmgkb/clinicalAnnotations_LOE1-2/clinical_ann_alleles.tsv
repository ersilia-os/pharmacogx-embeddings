1451434900	A	The rs267606617 A allele (also known as the 1555A allele) is assigned as a MT-RNR1 normal risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss allele by CPIC. Patients with the A allele may have a decreased, but not absent, risk of experiencing hearing loss when treated with streptomycin as compared to patients with the G allele.

Other genetic and clinical factors may also influence risk of hearing loss when treated with streptomycin.

Patients with the CC genotype may have decreased DPYD activity as compared to those with the GG genotype. Other genetic and clinical factors may also affect DPYD activity.	
1451289700	CG	The C allele of rs75017182 when measured on plus chromosomal strand is a marker for the HapB3 allele and is assigned decreased function by CPIC. Patients with the CG genotype may have decreased DPYD activity as compared to those with the GG genotype. Other genetic and clinical factors may also affect DPYD activity.	
1451289700	GG	The C allele of rs75017182 when measured on plus chromosomal strand is a marker for the HapB3 allele and is assigned decreased function by CPIC. Patients with the GG genotype may have increased DPYD activity as compared to those with the CC or CG genotype. Other genetic and clinical factors may also affect DPYD activity.	
1183701224	*31:01:02	Patients with one or two copies of the HLA-A*31:01:02 allele who are treated with carbamazepine may have an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions as compared to patients with no HLA-A*31:01:02 alleles or negative for the HLA-A*31:01:02 test. However, conflicting evidence has been reported. Other genetic and clinical factors may also influence a patient's risk of adverse reactions.	Presence
