This annotation is not used for clinical annotation scoring. Article designed about c.1129–5923C>G as additional risk variant and not to detect association with toxicity and c.1679T>G In the conclusion the authors state: "....c.1129–5923C>G DPYD variant as a predictive marker of early‐onset FP toxicity in a “real‐world” clinical setting. We estimate that fewer than 50 patients need to be screened prior to therapy for this variant and for c.1905+1G>A, c.1679T>G and c.2846A>T in order to prevent one case of severe FP toxicity."

This annotation is not used for clinical annotation scoring. Article designed about c.1129–5923C>G as additional risk variant and not to detect association with toxicity and c.1679T>G In the conclusion the authors state: "....c.1129–5923C>G DPYD variant as a predictive marker of early‐onset FP toxicity in a “real‐world” clinical setting. We estimate that fewer than 50 patients need to be screened prior to therapy for this variant and for c.1905+1G>A, c.1679T>G and c.2846A>T in order to prevent one case of severe FP toxicity."
1183630664	1444607122	Variant Phenotype Annotation	https://www.pharmgkb.org/variantAnnotation/1444607122	25381393	Genotype AC is not associated with risk of Drug Toxicity when treated with fluorouracil in people with Colonic Neoplasms as compared to genotype AA.	This annotation is not used for clinical annotation scoring. Lack of a statistically significant association was likely due to the low frequency of the allele in the population (only 4 patients with the AC genotype). No significant increase in risk of experiencing grade 3 or higher adverse events, either 5-fluorouracil-related adverse events or overall adverse events.
