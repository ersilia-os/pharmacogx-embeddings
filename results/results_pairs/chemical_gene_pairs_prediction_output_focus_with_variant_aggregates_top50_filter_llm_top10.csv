Given the auxiliary information about cycloserine interacting with the human proton-coupled amino acid transporter 2 (SLC36A2), and considering both SLC22A2 and SLC36A2 are part of the SLC family of transporters, there is a high probability of pharmacogenetic relevance. SLC22A2 might influence cycloserine pharmacokinetics by altering its absorption, distribution, or excretion."
