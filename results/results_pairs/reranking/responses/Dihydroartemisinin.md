# Dihydroartemisinin
## 1. CYP3A4
CYP3A4 is one of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. These enzymes metabolize several endogenous substances as well as exogenous substrates like lipids and xenobiotics. Artemisinin and its derivatives (which include Dihydroartemisinin) are also metabolized by this enzyme.
## 2. CYP2C19
CYP2C19 is another cytochrome P450 enzyme involved in drug metabolism, and is known to metabolize several other drugs. Considering that Dihydroartemisinin is an antimalarial drug, the CYP2C19 enzyme may lead to individual differences in the rates of metabolism of this drug, ultimately affecting the therapeutic effectiveness.
## 3. ABCB1
ABCB1, a gene coding for the P-glycoprotein, is a transporter protein involved in drug disposition. This protein has been shown to modulate the absorption and secretion of many drugs including antimalarials. If Dihydroartemisinin were also a substrate for P-glycoprotein, then polymorphisms in ABCB1 might affect the drug's absorption and secretion rates, and thereby have an impact on its level of exposure.
## 4. CYP2D6
CYP2D6, another cytochrome P450 enzyme, is known for its role in metabolizing a diverse range of drugs. Given the proven role of CYP P450 enzymes in the metabolism of artemisinin-based drugs, it is reasonable to assume that CYP2D6 could also play a significant role in the metabolism of Dihydroartemisinin.
## 5. CYP2C9
CYP2C9 is another important enzyme in the cytochrome P450 enzyme family, which plays a key role in the metabolism of various drugs. Considering the broad role that the CYP450 enzymes play in the metabolism of drugs, including artemisinin derivatives, it's plausible that CYP2C9 also plays a role in Dihydroartemisinin pharmacogenetics.
## 6. CYP2B6
The CYP2B6 enzyme, which is part of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, is involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. Considering its role in the metabolism of xenobiotics, it can be predicted that CYP2B6 has a potential role in Dihydroartemisinin metabolism.
## 7. CYP2A6
CYP2A6 is another member of the Cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. Given the influence of this enzyme family in drug metabolism, including Dihydroartemisinin's structurally related antimalarial, artemisinin, it is plausible that CYP2A6 is also involved in Dihydroartemisinin metabolism.
## 8. G6PD
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency causes varying degrees of hemolytic anemia in response to oxidative stress. Dihydroartemisinin has some oxidative activity and thus, G6PD could theoretically be implicated in the drug's pharmacogenetics.
## 9. CYP3A5
As a member of cytochrome P450 family of enzymes, CYP3A5 is involved in the metabolism of many drugs. Given this, it is plausible to assume that it could also play a potential role in the metabolism of Dihydroartemisinin.
## 10. CYP2E1
CYP2E1 is part of the Cytochrome P450 superfamily and is involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics in the body. Although it is primarily involved in the metabolism of small molecule compounds, it is plausible, considering the broad role that CYP450 enzymes play in xenobiotic metabolism, that CYP2E1 may have a role in the metabolism of Dihydroartemisinin.
