        "gene": "CYP3A4",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "CYP3A4 (Cytochrome P450 3A4) is one of the most important enzymes involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics in the body. Considering that bedaquiline's metabolism primarily occurs in the liver, and it is extensively metabolized before excretion, it is highly likely that CYP3A4 may play a significant role in its metabolism. CYP3A4 is known to metabolize a large variety of clinically relevant drugs, so it stands to reason that it may also be involved in bedaquiline metabolism."

    {
        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "ABCB1 (ABCB subfamily B member 1) encodes P-glycoprotein, a well-known drug transporter involved in multidrug resistance. Bedaquiline is known to be a substrate of P-glycoprotein, thus it might affect its absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) in the body. Variations in this gene can therefore significantly impact the pharmacokinetics of bedaquiline."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP3A5",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "CYP3A5 (Cytochrome P450 3A5) is another member of the CYP450 metabolic gene family, which plays an important role in drug metabolism. CYP3A5 could play a significant role in the metabolism of bedaquiline, since this is an enzyme modulating the metabolism of different types of therapeutics. However, the activity of this enzyme varies among individuals due to genetic polymorphisms, which might influence the pharmacokinetics of bedaquiline."

    {
        "gene": "CYP2C9",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "CYP2C9 (Cytochrome P450 2C9) is primarily known for its role in the metabolism of both endogenous and a wide array of toxic environmental chemicals and therapeutic drugs. Its potential role in bedaquiline metabolism cannot be ruled out, even though its substrate specificity differs from those of the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C19",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "CYP2C19 (Cytochrome P450 2C19) is involved in the metabolism of a variety of drugs. It's feasible to hypothesize that the metabolism of bedaquiline could be influenced by this enzyme. However, the drug specificity of CYP2C19 is different from those for the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes, hence it's ranked lower."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2D6",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "CYP2D6 (Cytochrome P450 2D6) has been reported to contribute to the metabolism of 20-25% of clinically-administered drugs. Given this broad role in drug metabolism, it may be involved in the metabolism of bedaquiline, but due to its known specificity for basic lipophilic drugs, it\u2019s ranked lower on the list."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCC1",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "ABCC1 (ABCC subfamily C member 1) gene is a part of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters family. The product of this gene is a membrane-associated protein that functions in cellular efflux processes, and might be involved in the drug resistance. Given the fact that bedaquiline is an antitubercular drug, the role of ABCC1 in multidrug resistance could potentially impact the pharmacokinetics of bedaquiline."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP3A7",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "CYP3A7 (Cytochrome P450 3A7) typically plays a role in fetal drug metabolism. While its enzymatic activity is similar to that of the more predominant adult form CYP3A4, it is less active overall against many CYP3A4 substrates. From this perspective, it is plausible it may play a minor role in the metabolism of bedaquiline."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2D7",
        "rank": 9,
        "explanation": "CYP2D7 (Cytochrome P450 2D7) is a pseudogene and generally not expressed in tissues. As such, it is unlikely to be involved in the metabolism of bedaquiline."
