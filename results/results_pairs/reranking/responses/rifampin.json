    {
        "gene": "CYP3A4",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "CYP3A4 is one of the most important enzymes involved in the metabolism of rifampicin, being well documented that rifampicin act as an inducer causing reduced plasma concentrations of co-administered drugs metabolized by this enzyme. Variations in the activity of this enzyme significantly impact an individual's response to rifampicin, affecting both efficacy and safety."
    },
    {
        "gene": "SLCO1B1",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "SLCO1B1, which codes for a member of the solute carrier organic anion superfamily that mediates the sodium-independent uptake of numerous endogenous compounds, is involved in the disposition of rifampicin. Known pharmacogenetic interactions of rifampicin involve this gene, thus suggesting a strong pharmacogenetic relationship."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "The ABCB1 gene encodes a P-glycoprotein involved in drug transportation across extra- and intracellular membranes. Polymorphisms in this gene can alter the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of rifampicin by modifying its absorption and resistance profiles."
    },
    {
        "gene": "NAT2",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "Rifampicin is reported to act as an inducer of NAT2, and genetic variations can affect the response to rifampicin, making it a prime candidate for pharmacogenomics studies."
    },
    {
        "gene": "NR1I2",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "The gene NR1I2 codes for a regulation protein of genes involved in drug metabolism and transport, and rifampicin interacts with it. This relationship can directly affect rifampicin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics."
    },
    {
        "gene": "SLCO1B3",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "SLCO1B3 is part of the solute carrier organic anion superfamily that helps the uptake of many endogenous compounds and drugs, and it interacts with rifampicin. Variations in this gene can alter the disposition of rifampicin and comorbid medication."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2B6",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "The metabolic activity of CYP2B6 influences the pharmacokinetics of rifampicin. As CYP2B6 participates in the enzymatic reactions that metabolize rifampicin, genetic variations of this gene can significantly alter the efficacy and safety of the drug."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C19",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "CYP2C19 is involved in the metabolism of rifampicin. Differences in the activity of this enzyme due to genetic variations can modulate individual response to the drug."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C9",
        "rank": 9,
        "explanation": "CYP2C9 metabolizes rifampicin, and different activity due to genetic polymorphisms might alter the efficacy and safety profile of rifampicin."
    },
    {
        "gene": "GSTT1",
        "rank": 10,
        "explanation": "GSTT1, coding for a member of the glutathione S-transferase family of enzymes, is involved in the biotransformation of a broad range of therapeutic agents, including rifampicin. Polymorphisms leading to reduced activity or non-functionality of this enzyme might influence rifampicin metabolism, triggering variance in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics."
