        "gene": "CYP2C19",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "CYP2C19 is an important gene in drug metabolism pathway and it has been linked with the metabolism of various drugs. Terizidone is metabolized in liver and it's possible that CYP2C19 could facilitate this metabolism. It's also known that CYP2C19 polymorphisms can affect drug metabolism rate. Hence it's likely that this gene would have a significant pharmacogenetic relationship with Terizidone."

    {
        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "ABCB1 gene codes for an ATP-dependent drug transporter protein (P-glycoprotein) which aids in transporting various substrates across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. P-glycoprotein has been reported to affect the absorption and disposition of many drugs. If Terizidone is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, polymorphisms in ABCB1 could influence the pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of Terizidone sensation."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCC2",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "ABCC2 (MRP2) encodes a protein that is part of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. ABC proteins transport various molecules across extra- and intracellular membranes. MRP2 is involved in biliary transport of conjugated drugs and has been implicated in drug-drug interactions. If Terizidone is a substrate of MRP2, then polymorphisms in ABCC2 could potentially affect the disposition (including biliary excretion) of Terizidone."

    {
        "gene": "G6PD",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "G6PD is a housekeeping gene that produces glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme participating in an important metabolic pathway, the pentose phosphate pathway. Even though there is no direct link between this gene and Terizidone, if Terizidone or its metabolites interfere with the pentose phosphate pathway, G6PD could have a pharmacogenetic relationship with Terizidone."

    {
        "gene": "HLA-DRB1",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "HLA-DRB1 belongs to the HLA class II beta chain paralogues and plays a crucial role in the immune system by presenting peptides derived from extracellular proteins. Variants of this gene could be more reactive towards certain drugs, possibly including Terizidone."
    },
    {
        "gene": "HLA-DQB1",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "HLA-DQB1, similar to HLA-DRB1, is part of the HLA complex and helps the immune system differentiate between self-cells and foreign substances. It can present drug antigens to T-cells, which could lead to a hypersensitivity reaction to some drugs. Variations in this gene might influence the immune response to Terizidone."
    },
    {
        "gene": "HLA-C",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "HLA-C is one of the classical MHC class I genes. Class I molecules manage the immune system's surveillance for cellular integrity, presenting internal protein fragments on the cell surface for scrutiny by immune cells. They are of crucial importance in recognizing infected cells and subsequently eliciting an immune response. Emergency cellular interactions with Terizidone could lead to different responses depending on the allele variant of HLA-C."
    },
    {
        "gene": "HLA-G",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "HLA-G belongs to the HLA non-classical class I heavy chain paralogues. It has specialized functions within the immune system, including roles in preventing the immune system from attacking the body's own cells and in promoting tolerance of a fetus during pregnancy. The gene could interact with Terizidone and mediate a modulation of the immune response, especially in an autoimmune context or during organ transplantation."
    },
    {
        "gene": "HLA-DPB1",
        "rank": 9,
        "explanation": "HLA-DPB1 belongs to the HLA class II beta chain paralogues which play a vital role in the immune system by presenting peptides derived from extracellular proteins. Variants of this gene can be more reactive towards certain drugs, including potentially Terizidone, and could mediate an idiosyncratic drug reaction."
    },
    {
        "gene": "HLA-DPA1",
        "rank": 10,
        "explanation": "HLA-DPA1 gene belongs to the  HLA class II alpha chain paralogues. Class II molecules normally present processed peptides from extracellular proteins. Variants of HLA-DPA1 could interact with Terizidone inducing drug-specific immune response. However, there is currently no conclusive evidence linking this gene to drug responses, and it is therefore the lowest on this pharmacogenetically ranked list."
