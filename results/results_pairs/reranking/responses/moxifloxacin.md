# Moxifloxacin
## 1. UGT1A1
UGT1A1 has been shown to be pharmacogenetically associated with moxifloxacin, according to PharmGKB. UGT1A1 is involved in the metabolism and elimination of a wide range of endogenous substances, drugs, and xenobiotics. Therefore, this gene's alteration could significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin. Thus, UGT1A1 ranks first in this list.
## 2. ABCB1
ABCB1, also known as MDR1, encodes a protein that functions as an ATP-dependent drug efflux pump for xenobiotic compounds with broad substrate specificity. Moxifloxacin being a xenobiotic, any mutation in ABCB1 could affect the drug's absorption, distribution, and elimination and hence it is ranked second.
## 3. CYP3A4
CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for drug metabolism and is known to metabolize a broader range of drugs. Most likely, moxifloxacin could also become a substrate for this enzyme. Hence, any genetic variations in this gene could potentially alter the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin which underlines CYP3A4 as a strong candidate for pharmacogenetic interaction.
## 4. SLCO1B1
SLCO1B1 encodes a protein involved in the sodium-independent uptake of numerous endogenous compounds and drugs. Given that SLCO1B1 contributes to the process of drug uptake, variations in this gene may influence the absorption and clearance of moxifloxacin.
## 5. ABCC2
ABCC2 gene encodes a protein that is involved in the secretion of bile and many endogenous substances, drugs, and toxins. Any polymorphism in ABCC2 could potentially affect the secretion of moxifloxacin thus altering its pharmacokinetics which makes it a potential candidate for pharmacogenetic interactions.
## 6. UGT1A9
UGT1A9 is involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and is known to glucuronidate a diverse group of drugs. Hence, any alteration in the function of UGT1A9 could influence the metabolism and clearance of moxifloxacin.
## 7. ABCG2
ABCG2 encodes a protein that is a member of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and known to transport various molecules across the plasma membrane. Hence, a genetic variation in ABCG2 could affect the distribution and elimination of moxifloxacin.
## 8. UGT1A6
UGT1A6 is involved in the metabolism of certain drugs. This suggests that UGT1A6 may play a role in the metabolism of moxifloxacin. A genetic change in UGT1A6 could affect the drug's metabolism, influencing its therapeutic efficacy or leading to adverse drug reactions.
## 9. G6PD
G6PD is involved in maintaining the level of the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). The existence of several clinically relevant variants of G6PD indicates that genetic changes in this enzyme could have a broad impact on drug response, including potentially influencing the response to moxifloxacin.
## 10. UGT2B7
UGT2B7 is a key enzyme in the glucuronidation pathway, which is one of the primary methods for the body to make many drugs more water-soluble for excretion. Variations in this gene could change the metabolism of moxifloxacin, potentially affecting its effectiveness and side effect profile.
