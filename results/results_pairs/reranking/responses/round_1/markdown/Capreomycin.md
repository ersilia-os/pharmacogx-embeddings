# Capreomycin

## 1. ABCC2
The ABCC2 gene encodes the MRP2 protein, an efflux transporter known to play a critical role in the pharmacokinetics of several drugs. Genetic variations in this gene, such as c.1249G>A and c.3972C>T, influence its function, thereby modifying the excretion and plasma concentrations of different drugs. As such, ABCC2 could potentially affect the effectiveness and toxicity of Capreomycin by modulating its transportation, absorption, distribution, and excretion within the body.

## 2. ABCB1
ABCB1 encodes the P-glycoprotein, a crucial player in the pharmacokinetics of numerous medications. It acts as an efflux transporter that modifies the absorption, distribution, and excretion of various drugs. Given its broad scope of function, ABCB1 could plausibly influence the pharmacokinetics of Capreomycin, affecting the drug's bioavailability and penetration in different tissues, potentially leading to variable treatment outcomes.

## 3. ABCC3
ABCC3 plays a significant part in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of several drugs, especially those used in chemotherapy. It may affect the transport and thus the excretion of Capreomycin, potentially influencing the drug's systemic and neurological effects.

## 4. ABCC4
ABCC4 modulates the efflux of various drugs from cells, thereby impacting drug concentrations in the body. This role can significantly influence the pharmacokinetics and the effectiveness of Capreomycin as ABCC4 might affect the drug's distribution and elimination.

## 5. ABCC5
The ABCC5 gene, an efflux transporter, significantly affects the pharmacokinetic profile of several drugs, suggesting it may play a role in the bioavailability and systemic toxicity of Capreomycin. This potential interaction might result in altered efficacy and toxicity of the drug.

## 6. ABCG2
ABCG2, a gene encoding a drug efflux transporter, can impact the pharmacokinetics of various drugs by altering their absorption, distribution, and excretion. This process could likely influence the pharmacokinetic profile of Capreomycin, and thus its overall therapeutic efficacy and safety.

## 7. SLCO1B1
As a facilitator of the hepatic uptake of drugs, variants in the SLCO1B1 gene can influence the pharmacokinetics of multiple drugs. By implication, interactions with SLCO1B1 could increase drug plasma concentrations of Capreomycin, potentially leading to altered efficacy and toxicity.

## 8. MT-RNR1
The MT-RNR1 gene, linked with aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss, could significantly influence Capreomycin's side effects like nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, possibly due to its impact on mitochondrial protein synthesis and cellular ion transport.

## 9. SLC22A16
SLC22A16 affects the pharmacokinetics of chemotherapy drugs by modifying their transport. Such an interaction could potentially play a similar role with Capreomycin, altering its bioavailability and the balance between its therapeutic and toxic effects.

## 10. CBR1
CBR1 has a substantial role in the metabolism of chemotherapy drugs. Genetic variants in this gene may affect the concentrations of these drugs in the plasma and their therapeutic and toxic effects. Therefore, CBR1 might potentially influence the metabolism and therapeutic efficacy of Capreomycin.
