# Streptomycin

## 1. MT-RNR1
Known to be susceptible to aminoglycoside antibiotics such as streptomycin. Interaction with streptomycin perturbs mitochondrial function in cochlear hair cells, likely leading to increased vulnerability to ototoxicity. The consequence of this pharmacogenetic interaction is clinically significant, as it could potentially result in serious adverse effects such as irreversible hearing loss. Given that this gene's role in mediating the reactions to streptomycin is well established, it is ranked foremost.

## 2. ABCB1
Involved in drug transportation and has been shown to interact with a variety of drugs including antivirals, chemotherapeutics, cardiovascular drugs, and analgesics. Variation in this gene can influence the bioavailability and penetration of these drugs in the body. Though not directly linked with streptomycin, considering its broad-spectrum interactions and key role in drug metabolism, it could plausibly interact with streptomycin.

## 3. ABCC2
ABCC2 variants can influence the function of the MRP2 protein, thereby affecting the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic outcomes of various drugs. Although the interaction between ABCC2's product, MRP2, and streptomycin has not been explicitly established, the broad range of drugs influenced by this gene, including some antibiotics, make a plausible case for potential interaction with streptomycin.

## 4. ABCG2
Involved in the pharmacokinetics of numerous drugs by altering their absorption, distribution, and excretion, hence may interact with streptomycin. Variants in ABCG2 can influence the interactions of these drugs, affecting their efficacy and safety.

## 5. HLA-A
Plays a key role in drug hypersensitivity reactions for certain drugs. Though its role in streptomycin interaction is less evident, the involvement of HLA-A in immune responses could potentially influence sensitivity to streptomycin-induced tissue damage.

## 6. ABCC4
Influences the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of various drugs by modulating their efflux from cells, thereby affecting the drug's concentrations in the body. It is not known if ABCC4 interacts with streptomycin, but given its noted interaction with a wide variety of drugs, it may likely interact.

## 7. ABCC3
Significantly influences the pharmacokinetics as well as the pharmacodynamics of drugs such as methotrexate and morphine by modifying their transport and therefore exerting a probable effect on the kinetics of streptomycin.

## 8. Tpmt
Plays a significant by modulating the metabolism of thiopurine drugs including azathioprine, mercaptopurine, and thioguanine, affecting the efficacy and possible side effects of these drugs. Even though streptomycin and thiopurines do not share the same pharmacological space, this ascertains a mechanism in which an abnormal variant of TPMT may affect drug activity.

## 9. SLC28A3
The SLC28A3 gene, involved in the transport of nucleoside analogue drugs, significantly impacts their absorption, distribution, and elimination. Variations in this gene could potentially alter the therapeutic dosing of similar drugs used to treat infections.

## 10. HLA-B
Crucial in pharmacogenetics primarily due to its capacity to cause drug hypersensitivity reactions like those with abacavir. Hypersensitivities reactions, although typically seen in drugs associated with the immune system, could potentially be triggered by drugs like streptomycin, that are not recognized for their immunogenicity.
