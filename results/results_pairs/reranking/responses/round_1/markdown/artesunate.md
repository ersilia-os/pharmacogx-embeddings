# Artesunate

## 1. CYP2B6
CYP2B6 is known to be involved in the metabolism of several drugs. Given its pivotal role in drug metabolism and the significant effect of its polymorphisms on drug efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic profiles, CYP2B6 deserves to be highly ranked for potential pharmacogenetic interactions with artesunate.

## 2. ABCB1
ABCB1, encoding P-glycoprotein, has been linked to artesunate transport. Its variants affect drug absorption, distribution, excretion, and bioavailability. It would be reasonable to infer a pharmacogenetic relationship between ABCB1 and artesunate, ranking it favorably due to these established associations.

## 3. G6PD
G6PD has been associated with treatment outcomes for artesunate, primarily due to its role in red blood cell stability. Genetic variations of G6PD impact drug response, making it a strong candidate for a pharmacogenetic relationship with artesunate.

## 4. ABCC2
ABCC2, encoding MRP2, impacts the pharmacokinetics of various drugs by influencing their excretion, thereby affecting plasma concentrations, effectiveness, and toxicity. Given these established drug interactions, ABCC2 could potentially interact with artesunate in a similar way, making it a likely candidate for pharmacogenetic interactions.

## 5. CYP3A4
CYP3A4 has prominent influence on many drugs' metabolism, affecting their efficacy and toxicity. As such, it might be inferred to have pharmacogenetic interactions with artesunate based on its wide-ranging effects in drug metabolism and its significant influence on altering pharmacokinetic profiles.

## 6. CYP2D6
CYP2D6 metabolizes a wide range of clinically used drugs. Although there's currently no known direct pharmacogenetic relationship with artesunate, its broad involvement in drug metabolism warrants potential indirect interactions with artesunate.

## 7. CYP3A5
CYP3A5 is known to affect the metabolism of multiple drugs, impacting their effectiveness and risk profiles. Given its prominent involvement in drug metabolism, it is reasonable to infer a potential pharmacogenetic relationship with artesunate.

## 8. UGT1A9
UGT1A9 has been implicated directly in glucuronidation of artesunate. Given its established role in artesunate metabolism, it warrants a high rank in the likelihood of pharmacogenetic interactions with artesunate.

## 9. SLCO1B1
SLCO1B1 has been associated with artesunate transport. Its variations influence the pharmacokinetics of several drugs, and it is reasonable to infer a potential pharmacogenetic relationship with artesunate due to these established associations.

## 10. IKBKG
IKBKG interacts with artesunate by affecting immune responses involved in fighting malaria. Variations in this gene can potentially impact the efficacy of artesunate, suggesting a potential pharmacogenetic association.
