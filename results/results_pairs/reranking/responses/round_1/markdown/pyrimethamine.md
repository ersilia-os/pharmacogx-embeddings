# Pyrimethamine

## 1. CYP2C19
CYP2C19 notably influences the metabolism of a significant spectrum of drugs, impacting therapeutic efficacy and safety, with recognised variations in the gene affecting drug metabolism and thus leading to differing pharmacological outcomes. Pyrimethamine, classified as an antimalarial medication, although not identified as a conventional substrate of this gene, it could theoretically interact with CYP2C19 due to its similar metabolic pathway to named CYP2C19-metabolized drugs.

## 2. CYP2C8
With pyrimethamine's pharmacogenetic interactions known to involve CYP2C8, its role in drug metabolism makes this gene a key candidate for having a pharmacogenetic relationship with pyrimethamine. Known variations in CYP2C8 could easily influence the metabolism of pyrimethamine, impacting its efficacy and toxicity.

## 3. ABCB1
ABCB1, encoding P-glycoprotein and modulates pharmacokinetics and efficacy of multiple drugs, influences absorption, distribution, and excretion. It possesses clinical relevance with drugs having marked bioavailability and brain penetration. Given that pyrimethamine is used in treating infections of the central nervous system, it's plausible to hypothesize that ABCB1 might also be involved in the transport of pyrimethamine.

## 4. ABCG2
Similar to ABCB1, ABCG2 is a gene encoding for an efflux transporter that significantly influences pharmacokinetics of various drugs by altering their absorption, distribution, and excretion. Given the similar pharmacokinetics among ABC transporters-substrate drugs, it is feasible that ABCG2 may have a pharmacogenetic interaction with pyrimethamine.

## 5. SLC22A1
As a gene encoding for the Organic Cation Transporter 1 (OCT1), SLC22A1 markedly influences absorption and distribution of various drugs. Though not identified as a conventional substrate of this gene, pyrimethamine, similar to metformin, could interact with SLC22A1 due to similar action and absorption pathways.

## 6. SLCO1B1
SLCO1B1 encodes a transporter which facilitates hepatic uptake of drugs, with noted polymorphisms affecting pharmacokinetics of multiple drugs. Although pyrimethamine is not a noted substrate of this gene, given its similarity to diagnosed SLCO1B1 substrates, it can be hypothesized that pyrimethamine may also interact with this transporter.

## 7. CYP3A4
CYP3A4, playing a pivotal role in drug metabolism, even though not known to primarily metabolize pyrimethamine, by virtue of its wide influence, it is possible that CYP3A4 variably interacts with pyrimethamine as well. Gene variations of CYP3A4 could potentially affect pyrimethamine's pharmacokinetic activity which might modify therapeutic response.

## 8. G6PD
Both pyrimethamine and G6PD are known to play crucial roles in the treatment and pathology of parasitic infections, leading to the possibility of a pharmacogenetic relationship. Additionally, G6PD deficiency is responsive to oxidative stress and redox balance within cells, which can be influenced by pyrimethamine as part of its action mechanism.

## 9. IKBKG
Like G6PD, IKBKG also engages with pyrimethamine through pharmacodynamic interactions. The gene influences key immune pathways - crucial in combating malaria, and mutations in the gene can thus potentially influence pyrimethamine's effectiveness in the treatment of malaria.

## 10. ABCC2
As a gene encoding MRP2 protein, ABCC2 influences pharmacokinetics and therapeutic outcomes of various drugs. The protein encoded by this gene is involved in the excretion process of drugs like methotrexate and can potentially mimic similar interactions with pyrimethamine, influencing its therapeutic efficacy and toxicity through MRP2 relevant pathways.
