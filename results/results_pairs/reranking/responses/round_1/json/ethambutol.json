        "gene": "NAT2",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "NAT2 is known to influence the metabolism of ethambutol, with variants tied to 'slow' and 'rapid' acetylator phenotypes leading to significant differences in plasma levels and exposure duration. 'Slow' acetylator alleles correspond to lower enzymatic activity and consequently higher ethambutol exposure, raising the risk of adverse effects like optic neuritis. Thus, NAT2 is of high relevance in determining the pharmacokinetics and potential toxicity of ethambutol."

    {
        "gene": "CYP2E1",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "Previous studies hint at CYP2E1\u2019s role in influencing ethambutol\u2019s pharmacokinetics and distribution, although the details are less understood. Given its primary involvement in drug metabolism, with variations in its activity leading to drug efficacy and adverse effects differences such as in the case of isoniazid and acetaminophen, there are reasons to consider CYP2E1 as a pertinent gene in ethambutol pharmacogenetics."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "ABCB1, encoding P-glycoprotein, has a role in controlling the pharmacokinetics of multiple drugs by influencing absorption, distribution, and excretion. Specifically, transporter genes such as ABCB1 might affect the pharmacokinetics of ethambutol, altering its distribution. Given the breadth of ABCB1's influence on various drugs' bioavailability, it is a relevant candidate gene for ethambutol pharmacogenetics."
    },
    {
        "gene": "NAT1",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "Although no direct association between NAT1 and ethambutol metabolism is established, NAT1 has central roles in metabolizing many drugs through acetylation. Pertinent examples include isoniazid, hydralazine, and sulfamethoxazole. Hence, it is reasonable to speculate that NAT1 could influence the pharmacokinetics and safety of ethambutol."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C9",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "CYP2C9 is another cytochrome P450 enzyme that significantly alters drug pharmacokinetics. Although the specific interaction between CYP2C9 and ethambutol is not well-documented, the gene might influence ethambutol\u2019s pharmacokinetics, indicating CYP2C9's potential significance in ethambutol pharmacogenetics."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C19",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "Like other CYP enzymes, variations in CYP2C19 can significantly influence drug metabolism and efficacy. While the link between CYP2C19 and ethambutol is not explicitly known, considering the enzyme's impact on drugs such as clopidogrel, omeprazole, and citalopram, CYP2C19 could potentially shape ethambutol's pharmacokinetics and therapeutic effectiveness."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2B6",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "CYP2B6 significantly affects drug efficacy by altering pharmacokinetics. Though an explicit effect of CYP2B6 polymorphisms on ethambutol was not reported, based on its influence on drugs like efavirenz, nevirapine, and methadone, CYP2B6 may reasonably have a role in modulating ethambutol's efficacy and safety."
    },
    {
        "gene": "GSTM1",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "GSTM1 has a role in drug metabolism, detoxification, and consequent changes in plasma levels and elimination rate. Being a member of glutathione S-transferase genes that contribute to drug metabolism, including that of isoniazid, GSTM1 could potentially influence ethambutol's metabolism and toxicity."
    },
    {
        "gene": "HLA-DQB1",
        "rank": 9,
        "explanation": "Though not directly implicated in drug metabolism, HLA-DQB1 could be relevant in the context of drug hypersensitivity. Given ethambutol's associated adverse effects, individuals with certain HLA-DQB1 variants could potentially exhibit different adverse effect profiles, emphasizing HLA-DQB1's role in pharmacodynamics."
    },
    {
        "gene": "NR1I2",
        "rank": 10,
        "explanation": "NR1I2 controls the transcription of genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes and transport systems such as CYP3A4 and MDR1. Thus, alterations in NR1I2 may indirectly affect the metabolism and efficacy of ethambutol, forming an important factor for ethambutol pharmacogenetics."
