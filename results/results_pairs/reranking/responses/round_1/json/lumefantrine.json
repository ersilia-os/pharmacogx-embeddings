        "gene": "CYP3A4",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "CYP3A4 is a paramount actor in the metabolism of lumefantrine. Largely expressed in the liver and intestine, it metabolizes many drugs including tacrolimus and statins. This gene\u2019s pharmacological interactions are critical for delivering personalized malaria treatment as its activity may alter drug levels, thus changing the drug's effectiveness and safety profile. Therefore, this gene holds a high chance of being intimately associated with this particular drug's pharmacogenomic landscape."

    {
        "gene": "ABCC2",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "The ABCC2 gene derivatives have a significant impact on the function of the MRP2 protein, which helps conduct drugs throughout the body. A therapeutic level of lumefantrine relies on this gene to properly function, thereby optimizing its efficacy and minimizing the risk of toxicity. This condition may also apply to drugs like methotrexate and tacrolimus, which are also mediated by MRP2 protein."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP3A5",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "CYP3A5 is involved in metabolizing several drugs, including lumefantrine. It is central to this drug's metabolism, and genetic variants of this enzyme can influence the rate at which this occurs. This modulation directly influences its therapeutic outcome and risk profile. In addition, this enzyme appears to play a minor role in the metabolism of lumefantrine, but due to its role in affecting several relevant drug pathways, it remains a considerable candidate."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C9",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "CYP2C9 significantly impacts the metabolism of drugs such as warfarin and losartan, resulting in the necessity of personalized dosing. Although not directly reported to be involved with the metabolism of lumefantrine, its broad involvement in the metabolism of drugs make it a plausible candidate."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C19",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "CYP2C19 metabolizes various drugs, adjusting their efficacy and the severity of their potential side effects. It is a significant actor in the digestion of drugs such as citalopram and voriconazole, which influences their therapeutic outcomes. Although not directly related with lumefantrine, it remains an important gene to consider due to its broad role in drug metabolism."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP3A43",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "The CYP3A43 gene, though not a primary actor in drug metabolism, is opined to interact pharmacokinetically with certain drugs by influencing their plasma concentrations. Since lumefantrine works similarly to these drugs, CYP3A43 stands out as a candidate."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP3A7",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "The CYP3A7 enzyme, prominently exhibiting itself during fetal development, is a player in the metabolism of drugs such as tacrolimus. It potentially alters the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug by increasing or decreasing its ativitiy, thus it could similarly influence lumefantrine."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2D6",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "CYP2D6 plays a pivotal part in metabolizing opioids and antidepressants, influencing the efficacy and safety of these drugs. Variations in activity can lead to different therapeutic outcomes. Its interaction with lumefantrine is secondary, however, considering its broad level of interactions with drugs, it cannot be excluded as a potential target."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 9,
        "explanation": "ABCB1 gene encodes P-glycoprotein, which influences the pharmacokinetics of various drugs such as antivirals, chemotherapeutics, and analgesics. Though lumefantrine is not one of them, the gene's broad influence on drug bioavailability warrants its consideration."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2A13",
        "rank": 10,
        "explanation": "CYP2A13 mainly metabolizes procarcinogens found in tobacco smoke, indirectly interacting with nicotine's pathway. Despite not directly metabolizing nicotine, its influence on smoke components could position it as a possible candidate due to shared metabolic pathways with lumefantrine."
