        "gene": "CYP2D6",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "CYP2D6, a member of the cytochrome P450 family, metabolizes many drugs and is involved in drug-drug interactions. In the processing of Linezolide, it could potentially contribute in biotransformation leading to inactivation of the drug."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C9",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "CYP2C9 is one of the most important metabolizing enzymes in the P450 family, acting as the principal enzyme in the metabolism of approximately 10% of drugs. It's plausible that Linezolide can be metabolized in part by this enzyme leading to its reduced efficacy."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C19",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "CYP2C19 plays a crucial role in the metabolism of several drugs. Variants in this gene can alter drug metabolism, possibly affecting the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of Linezolide."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "ABCB1 (also known as P-glycoprotein) is an efflux transporter and plays a major role in drug disposition. Function of this gene could be critical in determining absorption and distribution of Linezolide, consequently affecting the drug\u2019s therapeutic efficacy."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2D7",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "CYP2D7 is not a functional enzyme due to a genetic polymorphism. Therefore, even though it is part of the cytochrome P450 family, its role in Linezolide metabolism would be minimal if not non-existent."
