        "gene": "CYP3A4",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "CYP3A4 (Cytochrome P450 Family 3 Subfamily A Member 4) is an essential enzyme that plays a major role in the metabolism of numerous drugs including clindamycin. It metabolizes clindamycin into its active metabolite, N-demethylclindamycin. Hence, the genetic variation in CYP3A4 can significantly affect the therapeutic efficacy and safety of clindamycin."

    {
        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "ABCB1 (ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily B Member 1) gene codes for a P-glycoprotein which is an efflux pump that plays a significant role in the absorption and distribution of multiple drugs including clindamycin. The genetic variation in ABCB1 might alter the functionality of P-glycoprotein, thereby influencing the pharmacokinetics of clindamycin."

    {
        "gene": "HLA-B",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "Though major histo-compatibility complex class I molecule encoded by HLA-B does not directly influence the clindamycin metabolism, some literature evidence indicates that variation in this gene is associated with different drug responses. Therefore, HLA-B may have an indirect effect on clindamycin response."
    },
    {
        "gene": "HLA-DRB1",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "HLA-DRB1 gene codes for a major histo-compatibility complex class II protein and its variations have been associated with multiple idiosyncratic drug reactions. Although no direct evidence links HLA-DRB1 gene with clindamycin, pharmacogenetic interaction might exist influencing drug response."
    },
    {
        "gene": "HLA-A",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "HLA-A gene, like other HLA genes, does not have any defined role in drug metabolism, but some genetic variations of HLA-A have been associated with different drug responses, suggesting a possible influence on clindamycin response."
    },
    {
        "gene": "HLA-DRB3",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "HLA-DRB3, belonging to the HLA-DRB locus, encodes a major histo-compatibility complex class II protein. Similar to other HLA genes, HLA-DRB3 might have an indirect role in drug response modulation, perhaps also with clindamycin, but a direct pharmacogenetic relationship has not been established."
    },
    {
        "gene": "HLA-C",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "HLA-C encodes the major histo-compatibility complex class I molecules, known for their role in the immune response. Although their role in clindamycin response is not clear, genetic variations in HLA-C gene might still influence the drug response indirectly."
    },
    {
        "gene": "HLA-DQA1",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "HLA-DQA1 gene is part of the HLA complex on chromosome 6. It codes for a component of the MHC class II molecule, which plays a crucial role in immune response. Variations in HLA-DQA1 might affect the immune response to clindamycin, indirectly influencing the drug effect."
    },
    {
        "gene": "HLA-DQB1",
        "rank": 9,
        "explanation": "HLA-DQB1 is part of the HLA system, encoding MHC class II molecules that play a role in immune response. Variations may influence immune-mediated clindamycin response. However, the effect of HLA-DQB1 on clindamycin pharmacokinetics is not well understood."
    },
    {
        "gene": "HLA-DPB1",
        "rank": 10,
        "explanation": "HLA-DPB1 encodes a protein part of the HLA class II molecule. While it's not directly involved in drug metabolism, it takes part in immune response and could be indirectly related to pharmacokinetic events. No direct connection to clindamycin has been established yet."
