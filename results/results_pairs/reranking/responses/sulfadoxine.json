        "gene": "CYP2C9",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "CYP2C9 is an important cytochrome P450 enzyme with a major role in the oxidation of both xenobiotic and endogenous compounds. Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme metabolizes many drugs. Drugs that are likely to be substrates for CYP2C9 may have a clinically significant interaction with sulfadoxine. Therefore, variations in this gene can have profound effects on the efficacy and safety profile of sulfadoxine."

        "gene": "G6PD",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "Deficiency of G6PD is associated with hemolytic anemia, which could potentially be potentiated by sulfadoxine administration. Individuals with genetic variations leading to G6PD deficiency are at higher risk for experiencing adverse effects from sulfadoxine. Therefore, G6PD genetic makeup can impact the safety profile of sulfadoxine."

    {
        "gene": "NAT2",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) is involved in the metabolic clearance of various therapeutically important drugs that require acetylation for their metabolism. While there is not a known direct link with sulfadoxine metabolism, it could be speculated that NAT2 might be involved in additional metabolic pathways of sulfadoxine. Therefore, genetic variability in NAT2 may potentially alter the metabolism, efficacy and toxicity of sulfadoxine."
    },
    {
        "gene": "NAT1",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "Similar to NAT2, NAT1 also catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to arylamines, arylhydroxylamines and arylhydrazines, affecting the metabolism of certain drugs. Therefore, sulfadoxine, an arylamine, may be a potential substrate for NAT1. Genetic variations in NAT1, therefore, could impact the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sulfadoxine."

    {
        "gene": "HLA-B",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "HLA-B belongs to the HLA class I heavy chain paralogues. This gene has been linked to hypersensitivity reactions with certain medications. Although sulfadoxine is not directly reported to be associated with HLA-B, some individuals with certain versions of the gene might be at a higher risk for developing hypersensitivity reactions to sulfadoxine."
    },
    {
        "gene": "HLA-C",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "HLA-C also belongs to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system and plays a role in immune response. Although there is no known direct interaction between HLA-C and sulfadoxine, certain HLA genotypes may be associated with an altered immune response to the drug, potentially leading to adverse effects."
    },
    {
        "gene": "IKBKG",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "IKBKG encodes a regulatory protein involved in the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kB) signaling pathway, which plays an important role in inflammation, immunity, cell proliferation and apoptosis. There is currently no clear evidence supporting a direct link between this gene and sulfadoxine. However, sulfadoxine has anti-inflammatory properties, thus potential gene-drug interactions may exist."
