    {
        "gene": "CYP3A4",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "CYP3A4 is primarily responsible for metabolizing Delamanid, with variations in this gene affecting Delamanid's pharmacokinetics via altered enzyme activity, thereby impacting its therapeutic efficacy and safety profile. Given this direct and crucial role in Delamanid metabolism, the probability of pharmacogenetic relation is significantly high."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP3A5",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "CYP3A5, like CYP3A4, plays a key role in drug metabolism and affects the metabolism and effectiveness of various important drugs. Given the genetic and functional similarity to CYP3A4, it is likely that variations in CYP3A5 could also impact the metabolism and efficacy of Delamanid."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2D6",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "Although Delamanid is not known to be directly metabolized by CYP2D6, this gene is essential for the metabolism of a variety of therapeutically significant drugs. Given its role in pharmacogenetics, it is plausible that variations in CYP2D6 could influence the pharmacokinetics of Delamanid, potentially through indirect pathways."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "ABCB1, encoding P-glycoprotein, plays a pivotal role in modulating pharmacokinetics by acting as an efflux transporter that influences drug absorption, distribution, and excretion. Variations in this gene could alter the bioavailability and distribution of Delamanid, thereby influencing treatment outcomes."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C19",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "CYP2C19, similar to CYP2D6 and CYP3A5, plays a significant role in the metabolism of multiple drugs, which suggests that it may influence the pharmacokinetics of Delamanid, potentially through complex mechanisms of interaction with other metabolizing enzymes."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCC2",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "ABCC2 variants influence the function of the MRP2 protein, which affects the pharmacokinetics of various drugs by altering their excretion. Variations in ABCC2 could modify the speed and efficiency of Delamanid clearance, thereby impacting its efficacy and toxicity."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2B6",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "CYP2B6 has a pivotal role in the metabolism of several drugs. Given its role in drug metabolism, it could potentially influence the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of Delamanid, especially considering possible intertwining metabolic pathways with other CYP450 enzymes."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C9",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "CYP2C9 gene polymorphisms influence the metabolism of various drugs. Variations in CYP2C9 could indirectly affect the pharmacokinetics of Delamanid, perhaps through shared elimination pathways with other CYP450 enzymes, such as CYP3A4."
    },
    {
        "gene": "UGT1A1",
        "rank": 9,
        "explanation": "The gene UGT1A1 heavily influences the pharmacokinetic profiles of multiple medications primarily through glucuronidation. As such, while not directly associated with Delamanid metabolism, it could possess a potential influence upon Delamanid's pharmacokinetic parameters."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C8",
        "rank": 10,
        "explanation": "CYP2C8 plays a crucial role in the metabolism of various medications, affecting their efficacy and toxicity due to genetic variations. It is possible that it could influence the pharmacokinetics, either directly or indirectly, and thereby the efficacy and safety of Delamanid."
