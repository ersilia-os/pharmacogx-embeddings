        "gene": "CYP2C8",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "The CYP2C8 gene encodes the Cytochrome P450 2C8 enzyme, which is a key element involved in the metabolism of pyrimethamine. Polymorphisms in this gene may significantly alter the efficacy and toxicity of pyrimethamine by modulating drug metabolism and exposure levels. This would make dose adjustment potentially necessary to avoid adverse drug reactions and to achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes."

    {
        "gene": "G6PD",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "Variants in the G6PD gene can alter cellular processes and immune responses, impacting the treatment responses to and risk profiles of parasitic infections treated by pyrimethamine. While this interaction is not directly linked to drug metabolism, the pharmacodynamic impact of the G6PD gene on the efficacy of pyrimethamine is significant and warrants prioritization."

    {
        "gene": "IKBKG",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "Mutations in the IKBKG gene, which affects the NF-kappaB signaling pathway that is crucial in immune responses, can potentially influence the efficacy of pyrimethamine in treating certain parasitic infections. It may alter the immune system's response to infections, ultimately influencing the therapeutic efficacy of pyrimethamine."

    {
        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "The ABCB1 gene modulates the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of various drugs, including potentially pyrimethamine, by influencing their absorption, distribution, and excretion. Mutations in this gene can alter drug transport, potentially affecting pyrimethamine's bioavailability and penetration into target sites, necessitating dosage adjustments."

    {
        "gene": "CYP2D6",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "CYP2D6 is known to significantly impact the metabolism of various drugs. Although its involvement in pyrimethamine metabolism is not yet established, considering its broad impact on drug metabolism, CYP2D6 may influence pyrimethamine's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C19",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "While there is no documented interaction between CYP2C19 and pyrimethamine, this gene's significant role in drug metabolism suggests its potential to influence pyrimethamine's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Genetic variants could potentially modulate pyrimethamine response, warranting a place in the top ten list."

    {
        "gene": "ABCC1",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "ABCC1, encoding for an efflux transporter, could potentially influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of pyrimethamine. This gene, through its role in drug absorption, distribution, and elimination, may affect pyrimethamine's efficacy and pharmacogenetic interactions."
    },
    {
        "gene": "SLC22A1",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "SLC22A1, affecting hepatic drug uptake, could potentially impact pyrimethamine's pharmacokinetics and efficacy. Variants in SLC22A1 could result in different pharmacological outcomes, and considering its role in drug transport, it may be relevant in the context of pyrimethamine."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCB4",
        "rank": 9,
        "explanation": "ABCB4 mutations influence the function of the MDR3 protein, potentially impacting the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic outcomes of pyrimethamine. It could alter pyrimethamine's transport and disposition in hepatocytes, influencing the drug's efficacy and potential risk of drug-induced liver injury."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCG2",
        "rank": 10,
        "explanation": "ABCG2 influences the pharmacokinetics of drugs, potentially including pyrimethamine, by modulating their absorption, distribution, and excretion. Variants in this gene may modify pyrimethamine's pharmacokinetic interactions, potentially necessitating adjustments in drug dosing."
