        "gene": "NAT2",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "NAT2 is a well-documented pharmacogenetic interaction for isoniazid. It encodes for an enzyme that is directly involved in isoniazid acetylation, a key step in the drug's metabolism. Variants in NAT2 cause variability in acetylation rates, categorizing individuals as rapid or slow acetylators, which directly affects the risk for isoniazid adverse effects such as hepatotoxicity and peripheral neuropathy."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2E1",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "The gene CYP2E1 plays a significant role in the metabolism of isoniazid. The polymorphisms present in this gene can cause variability in drug metabolism rates, thereby affecting exposure to the drug and its metabolites. Thus, CYP2E1 gene variations impact the drug's pharmacokinetics, potentially altering its efficacy and toxicity profile."
    },
    {
        "gene": "GSTT1",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "The GSTT1 gene plays a crucial role in the detoxification and pharmacokinetics of isoniazid. Known polymorphisms in GSTT1 can lead to an individual having a null genotype, resulting in a lack of enzyme expression. Therefore, GSTT1 gene plays a crucial role in determining the pharmacogenetic relationship of isoniazid, and its null genotype can significantly impact isoniazid metabolism and the risk of adverse effects."
    },
    {
        "gene": "GSTM1",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "The GSTM1 gene, like GSTT1, is involved in the detoxification processes of isoniazid. Polymorphisms in GSTM1 can reduce enzyme activity, leading to increased plasma drug levels and slowed elimination rates. This can result in higher drug exposure and potentially elevated toxicity. These known associations make GSTM1 a key gene in the pharmacogenetics of isoniazid."
    },
    {
        "gene": "SLCO1B1",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "SLCO1B1 is involved primarily in drug transportation, the variations of which can alter the pharmacokinetics of various drugs, including isoniazid. Genetic polymorphisms in SLCO1B1 might affect hepatic uptake and plasma concentrations of drugs, thereby leading to altered efficacy and toxicity."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "ABCB1, which codifies for the P-glycoprotein, is involved in the modulation of the absorption, excretion, and distribution of various drugs, potentially including isoniazid. Variations in ABCB1 might affect the efficiency of these processes, influencing the drug\u2019s bioavailability, efficacy, and adverse reaction profile."
    },
    {
        "gene": "NR1I2",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "NR1I2, or the pregnane X receptor (PXR), is involved in the regulation of genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes and transport systems. Despite its known interactions with a multitude of drugs, its explicit role in isoniazid pharmacogenetics is not thoroughly documented. This said, alterations in NR1I2 could potentially provoke changes in isoniazid metabolism and efficacy."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2B6",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "CYP2B6 influences the metabolism of numerous medications. Although the exact impact of CYP2B6 on isoniazid metabolism might not be well-documented, the centrality of this gene in drug metabolism in general suggests that it could play a significant role in isoniazid pharmacokinetics."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C19",
        "rank": 9,
        "explanation": "Like CYP2B6, CYP2C19 is involved in the metabolism of various drugs. Variations in CYP2C19 can have a significant influence on drug efficacy as well as safety. While there may not be explicit evidence for a direct interaction between CYP2C19 and isoniazid, the role of this gene in drug metabolism suggests that it might play a substantial part in isoniazid pharmacogenetics."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C9",
        "rank": 10,
        "explanation": "CYP2C9, similarly to CYP2C19 and CYP2B6, plays a central role in metabolizing and detoxifying various drugs. Genetic variation in CYP2C9, which affects drug activation and metabolism, could potentially have an effect on isoniazid pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics."
