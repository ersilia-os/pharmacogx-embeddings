# Streptomycin

## 1. ABCC2
Given that ABCC2 codes for the MRP2 protein transporter which can influence the excretion and plasma concentrations of various drugs, this gene likely has a pharmacokinetic interaction with streptomycin. Streptomycin, being an aminoglycoside antibiotic is actively excreted unchanged via the kidneys, and MRP2 protein has been found to transport organic anions and is located on the apical membrane of polarized cells such as proximal tubule epithelium. Variations in the ABCC2 gene could potentially modify the excretory process, impacting the effectiveness and potential toxicity of streptomycin.

## 2. MT-RNR1
MT-RNR1 encodes the mitochondrial 12S rRNA and is known to have an increased susceptibility to aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity. As streptomycin is an aminoglycoside, there's likely a direct pharmacogenetic relationship here. Specifically, the MT-RNR1 M.1555A>G mutation has been shown to make mitochondrial ribosomes more susceptible to aminoglycosides. Given the known association with ototoxicity and mitochondrial damage in cochlear cells, MT-RNR1 is a potential target of streptomycin.

## 3. ABCB1
The ABCB1 gene codes for P-glycoprotein, a key efflux transporter that modifies the absorption, distribution, and excretion of multiple drugs including aminoglycosides like streptomycin. P-glycoprotein has been shown to protect tissues by reducing drug accumulation, hence the genetic variability in ABCB1 can influence the pharmacokinetic profiles of drugs, affecting their bioavailability and efficacy, while potentially contributing to multidrug resistance.

## 4. ABCG2
ABCG2 is another key transporter gene, encoding for an efflux transporter, BCRP, that can modulate the absorption, distribution, and excretion of numerous drugs. BCRP has been shown to interact with various substrates including chemotherapeutic drugs and antibiotics. Being an aminoglycoside, streptomycin may interact with ABCG2 in a similar manner, affecting the drug's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics that could impact its therapeutic effectiveness and safety profile.

## 5. ABCC4
ABCC4 encodes the MRP4 transporter associated with drug excretion. This may be relevant in the pharmacokinetics of streptomycin, as MRP4 has been reported to transport organic anions, including some antibiotics. Therefore, variants in ABCC4 could potentially modulate the effectiveness and safety of streptomycin therapy.

## 6. ABCC3
ABCC3 could have a role in streptomycin's pharmacogenetics as it encodes an efflux transporter, MRP3, which contributes to the excretion of endogenous substances and xenobiotics, and has been shown to transport some antibiotics. Variations in ABCC3 can lead to altered transport and excretion efficiency, potentially influencing the pharmacokinetics of streptomycin.

## 7. HLA-A
HLA-A has been suggested to influence sensitivity to drug-induced tissue damage through its role in immune response. While its interaction with streptomycin is less evident, a pharmacodynamic relationship might be possible, where HLA-A genetic variations may modify the immune response to streptomycin, potentially influencing the propensity or severity of drug-induced ototoxicity or nephrotoxicity.

## 8. CDA
The CDA gene, involved in the metabolism of certain chemotherapy drugs, could potentially be relevant in the context of streptomycin treatment. However, the interaction would be inferred based on its established role in drug metabolism. Changes in CDA could potentially modulate the effects of drugs like streptomycin, though the specific mechanisms remain speculative.

## 9. SLC28A3
SLC28A3, which encodes a concentrative nucleoside transporter, is involved in the uptake of nucleoside analogs into cells. While streptomycin isn't a nucleoside analog, this transporter's role in drug absorption and efficacy could potentially extend beyond its known substrates. Hence, genetic variations in SLC28A3 might impact the pharmacokinetic profile of streptomycin, possibly modulating streptomycin's effectiveness or toxicity.

## 10. HLA-B
As with HLA-A, HLA-B could also potentially influence streptomycin response. Given its known involvement in drug hypersensitivity reactions, the pharmacogenetic interaction with streptomycin could possibly be through modification of immune responses to the drug, lending a hand to possible hypersensitivity or other immune-mediated reactions to streptomycin.
