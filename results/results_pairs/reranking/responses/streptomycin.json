    {
        "gene": "MT-RNR1",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "MT-RNR1 encodes a mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (mt-rRNA) that has been implicated in ototoxicity, one of the primary toxicities associated with aminoglycosides like streptomycin. The drug can bind to mitochondrial ribosomes and cause misreading of mt-RNA, leading to defective protein synthesis and mitochondrial cell death. Variants of MT-RNR1 might therefore mediate susceptibility to streptomycin-induced ototoxicity."
    },
    {
        "gene": "MT-ND1",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "MT-ND1 is a mitochondrial gene that encodes a subunit of the mitochondrial complex I, a crucial player in oxidative phosphorylation. Disruptions in this process have been linked to aminoglycoside-induced toxicity. Streptomycin's mechanisms of toxicity could be modulated by genetic variations in components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCC2",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "ABCC2 (also known as MRP2) is a membrane-bound efflux pump that can transport a variety of drugs and drug metabolites out of cells. Even though streptomycin does not directly interact with ABCC2, variants of this gene might indirectly affect the renal clearance of the drug, thus influencing streptomycin's toxicity profile."
    },
    {
        "gene": "HLA-A",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "HLA genes are key players in immune response regulation. While there's no known direct interaction between streptomycin and HLA-A, it could influence the immune response against streptomycin-treated infections. Genetic variations of HLA-A could potentially modulate streptomycin's efficacy."
    },
    {
        "gene": "HLA-B",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "Similary to HLA-A, HLA-B variants can play a role in the immune response to streptomycin-treated microbes and might also indirectly influence the drug's efficacy."
    },
    {
        "gene": "HLA-C",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "HLA-C, like other HLA genes, can indirectly influence the effectiveness of streptomycin by modulating the immune response. Variations in the gene might therefore affect the clinical outcomes of streptomycin use."
    },
    {
        "gene": "HLA-E",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "HLA-E is involved in antigen presentation and immune response regulation. Though there's no direct interaction with streptomycin known, it might indirectly affect the drug's efficacy via immune modulation."
    },
    {
        "gene": "HLA-G",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "HLA-G, thought to have a key role in maternal-fetal cytokine regulation, is less connected to streptomycin's mechanism of action compared to other HLA genes. Its rank is therefore lower."
    },
    {
        "gene": "NELL1",
        "rank": 9,
        "explanation": "NELL1 is involved in bone and cartilage differentiation and mineralization. Although it plays a role in developmental processes related to the ear structure and could potentially contribute to aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity, its link to streptomycin is speculative and not supported by solid evidence."
    },
    {
        "gene": "BRINP3",
        "rank": 10,
        "explanation": "BRINP3 is associated with neuronal growth and differentiation but there's no established connection with streptomycin's mechanism of action or its toxicities. Its pharmacogenetic relation to this drug is, at best, highly speculative."
