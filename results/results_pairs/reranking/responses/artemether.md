# Artemether
## 1. CYP2B6
Among the ranked genes, CYP2B6 is already identified by PharmGKB to show known pharmacogenetic interactions with artemether. CYP2B6 is involved in many oxidation reactions of xenobiotics in the body and it shows inter-individual variability in function, which can influence the effectiveness or toxicity associated with drugs. Therefore, CYP2B6 is likely to remain as one of the highest probable genes relevant to a pharmacogenetic relationship with artemether.
## 2. CYP3A4
CYP3A4 gene encodes for an enzyme that metabolizes xenobiotics. Given the role of CYP3A4, it is likely involved in artemether metabolism. Therefore, genetic variation in this gene may affect the metabolism of the drug, which may influence its therapeutic outcome. Furthermore, CYP3A4 is involved in the metabolism of several drugs for which pharmacogenetic effects have been established.
## 3. CYP2C19
CYP2C19 is a key player in drug metabolism and thus plausible pharmacogenetic relationships with artemether may exist. Genetic variations in CYP2C19 gene have been linked to extensive, intermediate, and poor metabolism of drugs. Individuals who are poor metabolizers may showcase adverse reactions or may require a different dose when compared to normal responders.
## 4. ABCB1
ABCB1 gene, known to code for P-glycoprotein, plays a crucial role in drug disposition by mediating drug efflux across cell membranes. The geneâ€™s role in drug resistance suggests plausible pharmacogenetic relationships with artemether, as altered function or expression of P-glycoprotein can affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs.
## 5. CYP2C8
CYP2C8 is involved in the metabolism of many drugs, and variations in this gene could likely affect the response to artemether. Enzymes produced by this gene contribute to the metabolism of arachidonic acid and certain chemotherapeutic drugs, hinting possible pharmacogenetic relationships.
## 6. CYP3A5
Given CYP3A5's ability to metabolize endogenous substances and wide variety of drugs, it is plausible that variations in CYP3A5 would show pharmacogenetic relationship with artemether. Functional differences in the CYP3A5 gene product can influence the drug response.
## 7. CYP2D6
CYP2D6, known to be involved in the metabolism of many cardiovascular and neurologic medications, is a potential player in artemether pharmacokinetics. Genetic variations leading to loss of function or gain of function phenotypes of CYP2D6 could affect artemether metabolism.
## 8. CYP2C9
CYP2C9 gene is involved in metabolizing a significant number of drugs and genetic variations affecting this enzyme could play a role in artemether response. It has a role in both the metabolism and bioactivation of many clinically important anticoagulants and antidiabetic drugs.
## 9. G6PD
G6PD deficiency could play a significant role in the pharmacogenetics of artemether. G6PD deficient individuals may have an altered response to artemether especially considering that artemether has some pro-oxidant properties.
## 10. CYP2A6
CYP2A6 is involved in the metabolism of several xenobiotics and drugs. Given its role, there could be a possible interaction with artemether. Especially, the presence of variants in this gene that impact enzyme activity may affect drug response.
