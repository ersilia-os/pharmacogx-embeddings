# Ethambutol
## 1. CYP2E1
CYP2E1 is known to play a role in the metabolism of ethambutol in humans. Genetic polymorphisms in this enzyme can influence the pharmacokinetics of ethambutol, affecting the drug exposure. Such genetic variations can potentially impact the drug's efficacy and toxicity. Therefore, this is a likely candidate for pharmacogenetic interaction with ethambutol.
## 2. CYP2C19
CYP2C19 is another cytochrome P450 enzyme that metabolizes ethambutol. Similar to CYP2E1, genetic polymorphisms in CYP2C19 might differentiate patient responses to ethambutol therapy, potentially impacting the drug's effectiveness and adverse effects. Consequently, CYP2C19 is a strong candidate for pharmacogenetic interaction with ethambutol.
## 3. CYP2D6
CYP2D6 is known to be part of the group of cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize ethambutol. Variations in CYP2D6 can affect drug metabolism and therefore the bioavailability of the drug in the system. Polymorphisms in this gene may result in inter-individual differences in drug response, potentially influencing clinical outcomes.
## 4. ABCB1
ABCB1, also known as P-glycoprotein, is a key drug efflux transporter which can influence the pharmacokinetics of many drugs by affecting their absorption, distribution, and excretion. Although there are no specific transporters identified for ethambutol, the role of ABCB1 in drug response cannot be disregarded without studies, potentially making it a pharmacogenetically relevant candidate.
## 5. CYP1A2
Advocated by the auxiliary information, polymorphisms in CYP1A2 can influence the pharmacokinetics of ethambutol, which may impact both the efficacy and the toxicity of the drug. Despite this enzyme not being included in the provided pre-ranked gene list, its contribution cannot be denied.
## 6. NAT2
NAT2 is already known to show pharmacogenetic interactions with ethambutol. Variants of this gene influence the metabolism of several drugs. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that genetic variations in NAT2 might impact individual responses to ethambutol therapy.
## 7. CYP2C9
CYP2C9 is part of the group of cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize ethambutol, suggesting potential pharmacogenetic interaction. Polymorphisms in CYP2C9 could lead to variation in drug metabolism and thereby, individual drug response.
## 8. CYP2A6
CYP2A6, another enzyme implicated in the metabolism of ethambutol, could be a potential candidate for pharmacogenetic research on this drug. Polymorphisms in this gene can result in differences in drug metabolism, potentially affecting the drug's bioavailability.
## 9. TNF
TNF gene encodes tumor necrosis factor, a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a central role in inflammation and immune response. Variations in this gene might impact the immune response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, indirectly influencing the effectiveness of ethambutol.
## 10. HLA-DRB1
The HLA-DRB1 gene belongs to the HLA class II beta chain paralogues, involved in the immune system's adaptive response. Variability in these genes can influence individual response to infections, including tuberculosis. Although there is no direct evidence linking HLA-DRB1 to ethambutol pharmacogenetics, it's plausible to hypothesize such a relationship, given the gene's role in the immune response.
