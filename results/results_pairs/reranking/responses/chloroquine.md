# Chloroquine
## 1. G6PD
G6PD is known for the role it plays in regulating the pentose phosphate pathway, which is involved in the protection of red blood cells from oxidative damage. A deficiency in G6PD makes cells more susceptible to oxidative stress. Chloroquine, an anti-malarial medication, causes oxidative stress in parasite-infested red blood cells, leading to their subsequent breakdown. Therefore, individuals with a G6PD deficiency may see ineffective or adverse effects from chloroquine treatment, indicating a close pharmacogenetic relationship between this drug and gene.
## 2. CYP3A4
CYP3A4, a member of the Cytochrome P450 enzyme family, is involved in the oxidation of organic substances. These include drugs such as chloroquine. Research indicates that CYP3A4 is critical in the metabolism of chloroquine, making it a likely candidate for drug-gene interaction. Differences in CYP3A4 activity can bring about variability in chloroquine pharmacokinetics, including clearance rate and bioavailability.
## 3. ABCB1
The ABCB1 gene encodes P-glycoprotein, which is known to function as a drug efflux pump, reducing the intracellular concentrations of many drugs. Changes in ABCB1 function could therefore have significant implications for the pharmacokinetics of drugs known to be substrates for P-glycoprotein, including chloroquine. Moreover, studies suggests that chloroquine resistance in malaria may partly be due to enhanced efflux of the drug by ABCB1 in the parasite's gut.
## 4. SLCO2B1
The SLCO2B1 gene is responsible for encoding an organic anion transporter protein, which mediates the uptake of drugs from the blood into tissues. Chloroquine, being basic and lipophilic, could be a substrate for this transporter, hence, any variations in the function or expression of the SLCO2B1 gene could influence the disposition and effectiveness of the drug.
## 5. CYP2C19
The CYP2C19 enzyme, encoded by the CYP2C19 gene, plays a role in the metabolism of several clinically important drugs. Some studies suggest that chloroquine is metabolized by this enzyme. Therefore, individuals who have a variant in the CYP2C19 gene that affects its function could see changes to the metabolism of chloroquine and resultant changes in its effectiveness or safety.
## 6. CYP2C9
CYP2C9 is responsible for the metabolism of a variety of xenobiotics and drugs. Although it's clear role in chloroquine metabolism is not fully understood, there may be a potential for interaction. Genetic variations in CYP2C9 could influence the disposition and pharmacologic actions of chloroquine, warranting further investigation of this relationship.
## 7. CYP2D6
CYP2D6 is another member of the Cytochrome P450 enzyme family and it metabolizes many clinically relevant drugs. However, there is limited evidence to suggest a significant role for CYP2D6 in the metabolism of chloroquine. Therefore, whilst there is a potential for interaction between this gene and the chloroquine, it is likely not as pronounced as with other genes mentioned earlier.
## 8. CYP2C8
CYP2C8 is known for metabolizing numerous drugs and endogenous compounds, however, its role in the metabolism of chloroquine remains unclear. While there might be potential for interaction, a concrete relationship between CYP2C8 and chloroquine metabolism is yet to be established.
## 9. CYP2D7
CYP2D7, from the CYP2D subfamily of enzymes, is a pseudogene in humans with limited or no known metabolic activity. Although the gene was included in the pre-ranked list, its pharmacogenetic relevance to chloroquine in humans is likely minimal unless future studies uncover a previously unidentified function.
## 10. BRAF
The BRAF gene is a human gene that encodes a protein called B-Raf. The gene is involved in sending signals inside cells and in cell growth. Its relevance in the context of chloroquine pharmacogenetics is likely minimal as no direct relationship has been established between BRAF and chloroquine metabolism or action. While knowledge of additional functions or pathways might change this rank, the current lack of direct evidence supporting a relationship between BRAF and chloroquine leads to a low ranking.
