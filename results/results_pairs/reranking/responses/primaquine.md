# Primaquine
## 1. G6PD
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is known to make individuals more sensitive to the haemolytic effects of primaquine. The safety and efficacy of primaquine can be substantially altered in individuals with G6PD deficiency
## 2. CYP2D6
CYP2D6 is known to metabolize primaquine and genetic variation in this gene can alter the pharmacokinetics and potentially the therapeutic efficacy of the drug. CYP2D6 poor metabolizers may have decreased efficacy of primaquine.
## 3. ABCB1
ABCB1 gene encodes a protein that is involved in drug transport across the cell membrane. Variations in this gene may influence primaquine absorption and distribution influencing the drug's therapeutic efficacy.
## 4. CYP3A4
CYP3A4 is involved in the oxidation of a wide range of substrates, including many drugs. It's plausible that this enzyme could also contribute to the metabolism of primaquine thereby affecting the pharmacokinetics of the drug.
## 5. SLCO2B1
SLCO2B1 mediates the Na+-independent uptake of organic anions such as primaquine. Variations in this gene could likely influence the uptake and consequently the pharmacokinetics of primaquine.
## 6. CYP2C19
CYP2C19 is involved in the metabolism of a variety of therapeutics. Although there's no direct evidence, since primaquine is metabolized in the liver, CYP2C19 may also play a role in its metabolism.
## 7. CYP2C9
CYP2C9 is known to metabolise many drugs, so there's a chance it also plays a role in the metabolism of primaquine, which would mean it could influence the drug's efficacy and safety.
## 8. CYP1A2
CYP1A2 is one of the main CYP enzymes involved in the metabolism of drugs. If primaquine is a substrate of this enzyme, genetic variations of CYP1A2 might affect the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of primaquine.
## 9. CYP2E1
While CYP2E1 is known to metabolize small molecule drugs and toxins, its involvement in primaquine metabolism is not directly proven yet, but it might still have a role to play in drug metabolism and detoxification.
## 10. CYB5R3
CYB5R3 participates in the desaturation and elongation of fatty acids, steroids, and other molecules that could be involved in drug metabolism. It is a long shot for primaquine, but it might be involved in metabolic pathways indirectly influencing the drug's pharmacokinetics.
