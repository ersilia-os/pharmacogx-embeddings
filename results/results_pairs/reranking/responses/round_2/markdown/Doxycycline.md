# Doxycycline

## 1. SLCO1B1
SLCO1B1 plays a key role in the hepatic uptake of many drugs, and its polymorphisms significantly impact the pharmacokinetics of these drugs by influencing their plasma concentration. Considering the auxiliary information which suggests a role of MATE proteins in renal excretion of doxycycline, SLCO1B1 quite likely carries an analogous role in hepatic transport of the drug. Thus, genetic variants in SLCO1B1 could likely affect doxycycline concentrations, altering the drug's efficacy or toxicity.

## 2. ABCB1
ABCB1 is highly involved in modulating the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of multiple drugs by serving as an efflux transporter and influencing drug absorption, distribution, and excretion. Given its wide-ranging effects on diverse classes of drugs, including antivirals and immunosuppressants, ABCB1 might likely have interactions with doxycycline and potentially be involved in its distribution or excretion.

## 3. ABCC2
ABCC2 gene variants affect the function of the MRP2 protein, influencing the pharmacokinetics of various drugs. The gene may have a significant role in doxycycline's transport, modifying the renal excretion and plasma concentrations of the drug, thereby impacting its effectiveness and toxicity.

## 4. ABCG2
ABCG2 plays a crucial role in influencing pharmacokinetics of several drugs by involving in their absorption, distribution, and excretion. A similar interaction with doxycycline could occur, as doxycycline might be subject to ABCG2's efflux mechanism, which might affect its bioavailability and plasma concentrations, adjusting the drug's effectiveness or toxicity.

## 5. CYP3A4
CYP3A4 is involved in the metabolism of many drugs, impacting their effects and toxicity. Even if doxycycline is primarily eliminated via fecal excretion, a small portion might be metabolized in the liver, potentially mediated by CYP3A4. This could affect the overall plasma levels of the drug and thus its therapeutic efficacy.

## 6. ABCB4
Given ABCB4 is involved in influencing the pharmacokinetics of drugs like imatinib through its impact on transport, it could carry a potential pharmacokinetic interaction with doxycycline, affecting its distribution or disposition.

## 7. ABCC3
ABCC3, involved in modulating the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs such as methotrexate and morphine, may play a significant role in doxycycline's transport, thereby potentially modifying the excretion and plasma concentrations of the drug.

## 8. ABCC5
ABCC5, known for facilitating ATP-dependent drug efflux, influences pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of several drugs including anticancer drugs like fluorouracil and capecitabine. A similar interaction with doxycycline might occur, impacting the drug's absorption, distribution and elimination.

## 9. CYP2C19
CYP2C19 carries a pivotal role in the metabolism of several drugs, influencing their therapeutic efficacy and safety. If a small fraction of doxycycline is metabolized before elimination, CYP2C19 might be involved, potentially affecting its plasma levels, efficacy and safety.

## 10. ABCB11
ABCB11 plays a significant role in the pharmacokinetics of several drugs including the hepatic uptake and biliary excretion of various compounds. Similar interactions with doxycycline could lead to changes in drug bioavailability, efficacy, and toxicity, thereby potentially impacting treatment outcomes.
