# P-aminosalicylic acid

## 1. NAT2
NAT2 acetylates P-aminosalicylic acid in the human liver. Acetylation of the drug leads to urinary excretion. NAT2 fast metabolizers excrete the drug more rapidly and therefore need higher doses. On the other hand, NAT2 slow metabolizers have elevated plasma levels and may experience increased toxicity. Therefore, NAT2 pharmacogenetic testing can personalize the treatment with P-aminosalicylic acid, lowering the risk of side effects and ensuring the expected therapeutic effect.

## 2. NAT1
The enzyme encoded by NAT1 also acetylates P-aminosalicylic acid. However, this action occurs mainly in extrahepatic tissues. NAT1 fast metabolizers might excrete the drug more rapidly in these tissues, reducing its local action. Slow metabolizers may have an extended action but may be at risk of local toxicity. Therefore, despite occurring in a different compartment, the role of NAT1 in P-aminosalicylic acid pharmacogenetics is very significant.

## 3. ABCB1
ABCB1 codes for P-glycoprotein, one of the main efflux transporters in the human body. P-glycoprotein is expressed predominantly in the liver, kidneys and intestines, and it promotes the excretion of a wide variety of drugs and toxins, including P-aminosalicylic acid. Therefore, variations in the ABCB1 gene that diminish the function of P-glycoprotein could lead to elevated plasma levels and increased toxicity of P-aminosalicylic acid. Conversely, ABCB1 fast metabolizers may require a higher dosage of the drug to achieve the desired therapeutic effect.

## 4. SLC22A1
SLC22A1 encodes the organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1). OCT1 is expressed mainly in the liver, where it facilitates the cellular uptake of various drugs. P-aminosalicylic acid is a cation at physiological pH and can be a substrate of OCT1. Therefore, genetic variants that modify the activity of the transporter can influence the hepatic clearance of the drug, altering its plasma levels and possibly its therapeutic effect and toxicity.

## 5. SLC22A2
SLC22A2 codes for OCT2, another transporter that handles organic cations. OCT2 is found mainly in the kidneys, where it facilitates the uptake of drugs from the blood into the renal tubular cells, an essential step for urinary excretion. Consequently, SLC22A2 variants can reduce the renal clearance of P-aminosalicylic acid, leading to increased plasma levels, potential toxicity, and possibly enhanced therapeutic effect. On the other hand, higher activity variants could require dosage adjustment due to increased excretion of the drug.

## 6. ABCC2
ABCC2 codes for the multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), an efflux transporter expressed primarily in the liver and kidneys. MRP2 contributes to the biliary and urinary excretion of various drugs and toxins. P-aminosalicylic acid could be a substrate of MRP2. Therefore, ABCC2 genetic variations can influence the clearance of P-aminosalicylic acid, with potential clinical implications on drug plasma concentrations, efficacy, and side effects.

## 7. HLA-B
While most of the pharmacogenetics of P-aminosalicylic acid involve pharmacokinetics, there are also potential pharmacodynamic interactions. The immune system might recognize P-aminosalicylic acid bound to HLA-B proteins, and this recognition could lead to immune-mediated adverse effects, such as hypersensitivity reactions. This process would depend on the specific structure of the HLA-B protein, which is determined by the genetic variations of the HLA-B gene. Therefore, certain HLA-B alleles may be associated with a higher risk of adverse reactions to P-aminosalicylic acid.

## 8. SLC22A3
SLC22A3 encodes OCT3, an organic cation transporter expressed in various tissues, including the liver and kidneys. OCT3 exhibits lower substrate selectivity and can transport a wide variety of drugs. Variants that modify the function of OCT3 could affect the hepatic uptake and renal clearance of P-aminosalicylic acid, potentially modifying the drug's plasma levels and therapeutic effect.

## 9. GSTM1
GSTM1 encodes an enzyme from the glutathione S-transferase family. These enzymes add glutathione to various drugs, making them more soluble and easier to excrete in the urine or bile. Variations in GSTM1 could affect this metabolic route of P-aminosalicylic acid. GSTM1 null variants, which lead to a lack of the enzyme, are frequent in the population and could lead to lower clearance and increased plasma levels of P-aminosalicylic acid.

## 10. G6PD
P-aminosalicylic acid can cause oxidative stress, which can induce hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency. Therefore, genetic variations that reduce the activity of the G6PD enzyme can increase the risk of this adverse effect. Consequently, G6PD deficiency is a contraindication for P-aminosalicylic acid. In this sense, G6PD is a crucial gene in the pharmacogenetics of P-aminosalicylic acid.
