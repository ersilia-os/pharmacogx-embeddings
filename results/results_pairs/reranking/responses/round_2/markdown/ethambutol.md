# Ethambutol

## 1. NAT2
NAT2, an enzyme crucial for drug metabolism through N-acetylation, has a known pharmacogenetic relationship with ethambutol. Genetic polymorphisms in NAT2 significantly influence ethambutol's metabolism, where "slow" NAT2 alleles can increase drug exposure and associated risks, including optic neuritis. In fact, NAT2 slow metabolizers have been reported to experience increased toxicity from ethambutol, implying an evident pharmacogenetic relationship.

## 2. ABCB1
Ethambutol's disposition in the body may be significantly affected by the product of the gene ABCB1. ABCB1 codes for an efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein, which mediates the absorption, distribution, and excretion of numerous drugs. ABCB1 has profound importance in determining the bioavailability and distribution of drugs across the central nervous system, affecting the pharmacokinetics of ethambutol.

## 3. NAT1
Similar to NAT2, NAT1 encodes an enzyme that is critical in the acetylation and metabolism of various drugs. Given the analogous function and similar substrate specificity of NAT1 and NAT2, it is plausible that NAT1 could participate in the metabolic pathways of ethambutol, possibly affecting drug's pharmacokinetics and toxicity.

## 4. CYP2E1
The gene CYP2E1 impacts the metabolism of many drugs. Based on its broad substrate specificity, it is possible that CYP2E1 may play a role in the metabolism of ethambutol, affecting the drug's efficacy and risk of adverse events.

## 5. CYP2B6
CYP2B6 plays a major role in drug metabolism. Ethambutol metabolism could potentially be influenced by this gene. Genetic variations in CYP2B6 affect enzyme activity, leading to differences in drug exposure and risks of adverse reactions, underscoring its potential role in the pharmacogenetics of ethambutol.

## 6. CYP2C9
CYP2C9 may contribute to the metabolism of ethambutol. Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2C9 are known to influence the metabolism of multiple drugs and could potentially affect the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and side effect profile of ethambutol.

## 7. CYP2C19
It is plausible that CYP2C19, an enzyme that is involved in the metabolism of an array of drugs, may also metabolize ethambutol. Variations in the CYP2C19 gene can affect drug activation and metabolism, leading to different pharmacological outcomes and may impact the pharmacokinetics of ethambutol.

## 8. GSTM1
GSTM1 plays a role in the metabolism and excretion of various drugs through glutathione conjugation. Given this function, it is likely that GSTM1 may contribute to the disposition and detoxification of ethambutol, potentially implicating it in ethambutol pharmacogenetics.

## 9. SLC22A1
SLC22A1, encoding for the organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1), significantly influences the absorption and distribution of various drugs by affecting their hepatic uptake. Given that ethambutol is positively charged at physiological pH, it is possible that this transporter may contribute to the distribution, and thus pharmacokinetics, of ethambutol.

## 10. HLA-DQB1
HLA-DQB1 gene variants significantly impact drug hypersensitivity reactions. Considering that ethambutol can induce adverse reactions, such as optic neuropathy, potential variations in immune response mediated by HLA-DQB1 might play a role in the susceptibility to such adverse effects.
