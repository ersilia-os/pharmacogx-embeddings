# Levofloxacin

## 1. ABCB1
The ABCB1 gene, coding for P-glycoprotein, is critical in regulating the pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin. Variations in this gene can influence levofloxacin's tissue concentration by altering its cellular efflux. Additionally, ABCB1's role in the bioavailability and transport of various drugs underscores its significance. Given its potential to alter levofloxacinâ€™s distribution and its well-documented involvement in pharmacokinetics of several other drugs, ABCB1 is placed at the top of this ranking.

## 2. ABCG2
ABCG2 is an efflux transporter that can influence absorption, distribution, and excretion of numerous drugs. Variations such as the Q141K allele can modify these drug interactions in clinically significant ways. Since it influences the pharmacokinetics of other drugs significantly and given the z-score, ABCG2 is ranked second to suggest a potentially similar role in mediating levofloxacin pharmacokinetics.

## 3. ABCC2
ABCC2, coding for the MRP2 protein, has been noted for its role in altering the excretion and plasma concentrations of drugs. The participation of ABCC2 in these pharmacokinetic processes, as seen with other medications, could potentially extend to levofloxacin, warranting its high ranking. Its importance in non-pharmacokinetic interactions could also have implications in terms of levofloxacin effectiveness.

## 4. CYP2C9
Though CYP2C9-mediated metabolism of levofloxacin is known to be minimal, the enzyme's notable contribution to the metabolism of a multitude of drugs makes it a viable candidate for impacting levofloxacin pharmacokinetics. Variants in CYP2C9 could affect levofloxacin metabolism, influencing efficacy and safety, and possibly require dosage adjustments.

## 5. SLCO1B1
SLCO1B1, a gene involved in drug uptake into the liver, may influence levofloxacin's excretion and overall pharmacokinetics. Variations in this gene, such as the c.521T>C allele, have been noted to affect the hepatic uptake of various drugs, potentially altering plasma concentrations and subsequently efficacy and toxicity, which can be extrapolated to a probable interaction with levofloxacin.

## 6. SLC22A1
SLC22A1, encoding for the OCT1, affects cellular drug uptake and distribution. Given levofloxacin's renal excretion and the gene's function in hepatic drug uptake, potential interactions between this gene and the drug could be suggested. Variations in SLC22A1 could affect levofloxacin's pharmacokinetics, with implications for drug concentrations, thereby suggesting its potential pharmacogenetic relevance for levofloxacin.

## 7. UGT1A1
UGT1A1 has a significant role in drug metabolism through glucuronidation, a phase II reaction. While there hasn't been direct evidence linking UGT1A1 to levofloxacin metabolism, its role in the metabolism of other drugs makes it a viable candidate for pharmacogenetic relevancy. Variations like UGT1A1*28 allele could influence levofloxacin metabolism, potentially impacting its concentration and toxicity.

## 8. CYP2D6
CYP2D6 is key to the metabolism of many clinically used drugs. Variations in this gene could lead to different exposures of drugs, affecting the risk of toxicity or drug efficacy. While levofloxacin isn't classically metabolized by CYP2D6, the gene's significant impact on pharmacokinetics of other drugs proposes potential implications in levofloxacin processing.

## 9. ABCC4
ABCC4 influences pharmacokinetics by modifying drug efflux from the cells. This suggests that it could potentially alter the bioavailability of levofloxacin, and given its interaction with multiple drugs, it is considered as a candidate for the pharmacogenetic profile of levofloxacin.

## 10. CYP1A2
CYP1A2, well-known for its role in drug metabolism, affects the pharmacokinetics of multiple drugs. Though levofloxacin isn't predominantly metabolized by CYP1A2, the possibility that genetic variations in CYP1A2 may affect levofloxacin metabolism and thereby its effectiveness and safety makes it a potential candidate in this ranking.
