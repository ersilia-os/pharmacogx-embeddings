        "gene": "CYP3A4",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "CYP3A4, an enzyme significantly expressed in the liver and small intestine, influences the metabolism and thus effects and toxicity of lumefantrine. Variants in the CYP3A4 gene significantly affect the metabolism of lumefantrine, thereby impacting its efficacy and safety. Genetic interactions with inducers or inhibitors can either amplify or decrease CYP3A4\u2019s activity, necessitating lumefantrine dosage adjustments."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCC2",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "The ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCC2, also known as MRP2, is mainly expressed in the liver and kidney. It significantly contributes to the biliary and renal elimination of lumefantrine and its metabolites. Thus, variants in the ABCC2 gene that affect the function of this transporter can lead to altered lumefantrine levels, affecting its efficacy and safety."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP3A5",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "CYP3A5 plays a significant role in the metabolism of lumefantrine. As part of the larger CYP3A subfamily responsible for metabolizing a high proportion of drugs, CYP3A5 variation can induce significant changes in drug levels of lumefantrine, placing importance on further characterizing this variant in order to maximize the efficacy of lumefantrine."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP3A7",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "CYP3A7 is part of the larger CYP3A subfamily known for metabolizing a wide range of drugs. Although its expression decreases after birth, it can still contribute to the metabolism of lumefantrine in certain populations or under induction. Variations affecting the activity of CYP3A7 could thus modulate lumefantrine pharmacokinetics, especially in infants or populations with particular expression profiles."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2D6",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "CYP2D6 contributes to lumefantrine's metabolism, albeit to a lesser degree than the more prominent CYP3A4. Still, CYP2D6 polymorphisms can alter lumefantrine levels and clinical outcomes depending on an individual\u2019s metabolizer status. For instance, poor metabolizers might suffer from toxicity, while ultrarapid metabolizers could experience reduced drug efficacy. CYP2D6's contribution to lumefantrine variability should not be discounted."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "ABCB1 encodes P-glycoprotein, an efflux transporter that can affect the distribution and excretion of lumefantrine. Variants in the ABCB1 gene causing changes in P-glycoprotein function can influence lumefantrine's bioavailability and tissue distribution, potentially affecting its efficacy and safety."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP3A43",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "CYP3A43, like CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, is also part of the CYP3A subfamily known for its extensive participation in drug metabolism. Therefore, even though its direct interaction with lumefantrine has not been characterized, CYP3A43 could theoretically contribute to its metabolism, provided that expression is induced or in scenarios involving genetic variation."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C19",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "CYP2C19 can potentially metabolize lumefantrine considering that it is known to metabolize many other drug substrates. Genetic polymorphisms that alter CYP2C19 function can have implications for lumefantrine metabolism and, thus, its efficacy, distribution, and clearance."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C9",
        "rank": 9,
        "explanation": "CYP2C9 is part of the CYP2C subfamily known to metabolize almost 20% of all drugs. Although lumefantrine is primarily metabolized by the CYP3A enzymes, CYP2C9 could potentially contribute to a lesser extent given a particular substrate profile, presence of inducers or inhibitors, or specific genetic variants."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C8",
        "rank": 10,
        "explanation": "CYP2C8 could contribute to the metabolism of lumefantrine given its known involvement in the metabolism of a wide variety of therapeutic compounds including antimalarial drugs. This effect could be consequently modulated by genetic variations in CYP2C8, impacting drug metabolism and exposure, which in turn impacts therapeutic responses and adverse reactions."
