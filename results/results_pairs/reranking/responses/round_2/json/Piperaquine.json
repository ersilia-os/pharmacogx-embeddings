    {
        "gene": "CYP2D6",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "CYP2D6 is a key player in drug metabolism, with variations in its genetic code altering the therapeutic effect of a wide range of drugs through altering their plasma levels. Bearing in mind that Piperaquine is metabolised via the CYP450 system, this could extend to Piperaquine. The altered enzyme metabolism resulting from genetic polymorphisms could affect Piperaquine's plasma levels, thereby affecting therapeutic outcomes due to changes in drug clearance and bioavailability."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C19",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "CYP2C19 is one of the key enzymes that influences the pharmacokinetics of Piperaquine, affecting its metabolism and, therefore, its efficacy and safety. Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2C19 might potentially lead to altered metabolic rates, affecting Piperaquine's plasma levels, resulting in instances of therapeutic failures or toxicity due to changes in drug clearance and bioavailability."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP3A4",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "CYP3A4 is known to impact the metabolism of Piperaquine, meaning polymorphisms in the CYP3A4 gene could significantly influence the pharmacokinetics of the drug. Considering that this enzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of many other drugs, it can be inferred that an altered CYP3A4 activity could result in changes to Piperaquine's safety and efficacy profile."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP3A5",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "CYP3A5 metabolises a broad range of drugs, influencing their efficacy and toxicity profiles. As such, it's probable that CYP3A5 also affects the metabolism and effectiveness of Piperaquine. Genetic variants impacting CYP3A5 activity could thereby potentially alter Piperaquine's pharmacokinetic profile, influencing therapeutic outcomes and adverse reactions."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C9",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "Given the involvement of CYP2C9 in the metabolism of Piperaquine, genetic variants affecting its enzyme activity could change Piperaquine's metabolism and therapeutic levels in the plasma. This could result in differing pharmacological outcomes in patients due to alterations in drug pharmacokinetics."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "ABCB1 encodes P-glycoprotein, a protein that modulates the pharmacokinetic profile of many drugs through operating as an efflux transporter and influencing their distribution. Genetic polymorphisms in ABCB1 could affect this transport mechanism, therefore altering the absorption, bioavailability, and excretion of Piperaquine, leading to changes in drug plasma levels, efficacy, and potential toxicity."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCC2",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "ABCC2 gene variants influence the function of MRP2 protein, affecting numerous drugs' pharmacokinetics and therapeutic outcomes. Genetic variations that affect MRP2 protein function could potentially alter the excretion and plasma concentrations of Piperaquine, thereby influencing drug efficacy and toxicity."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2B6",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "CYP2B6 impacts the metabolism of a variety of drugs, and it's plausible that this extends to Piperaquine due to CYP2B6's involvement in drug metabolism processes. Genetic variations in CYP2B6 could influence Piperaquine's metabolism and plasma levels, affecting both therapeutic outcomes and the risk of adverse reactions."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCG2",
        "rank": 9,
        "explanation": "ABCG2, encoding an efflux transporter, influences the pharmacokinetics of a number of drugs by altering their absorption, distribution, and excretion. Genetic variants in this gene could impact Piperaquine's pharmacokinetics, possibly modifying absorption and excretion rates and thus affecting efficacy and safety."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2E1",
        "rank": 10,
        "explanation": "CYP2E1 significantly impacts the metabolism of many drugs, affecting therapeutic effectiveness and risk of side effects. As it's one of the major enzymes involved in Piperaquine pharmacokinetics, genetic variations in the CYP2E1 gene could alter its activity, potentially affecting Piperaquine's metabolism, efficacy, and risk of adverse effects."
