        "gene": "ABCC2",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "ABCC2 gene encodes for the MRP2 protein, which is known to be involved in the transport and excretion of various drugs, and thus directly influences their pharmacokinetics. Variants in ABCC2 affect the excretion and plasma concentrations of certain drugs, impacting their effectiveness and toxicity. Given the broad range of drugs affected by variations in this gene, it is logical to propose a potential pharmacogenetic relationship between ABCC2 and Capreomycin, influencing the drug uptake and excretion of Capreomycin, which, in turn, could affect the efficacy and toxicity of the drug."

    {
        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "The ABCB1 gene encodes the P-glycoprotein, a transporter that plays a crucial role in the absorption, distribution, and excretion of many drugs, affecting their bioavailability and brain penetration. Given the pivotal role of P-glycoprotein as an efflux transporter, it is highly plausible that it would impact the pharmacokinetics of Capreomycin. Genetic variations in ABCB1 could potentially alter the transport efficiency of Capreomycin, leading to alterations in the balancing between its beneficial and adverse effects."

    {
        "gene": "ABCC3",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "ABCC3, an efflux transporter gene like ABCC2, is known to significantly influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a range of drugs by affecting their transport. As variations in ABCC3 can affect the excretion of certain drugs and thereby their efficacy and side effects, a parallel relationship can be inferred for Capreomycin, where genetic variations in ABCC3 could impact the drug\u2019s transport and consequent systemic effects."

    {
        "gene": "MT-RNR1",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "Capreomycin, like other aminoglycosides, may affect the protein synthesis in cochlear cells, leading to ototoxicity. If this ototoxicity is driven by the high sensitivity of the mitochondrial ribosomes to the drug, the genetic variations in MT-RNR1 may have a significant impact on the susceptibility to aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss. Thus, MT-RNR1 might have a pharmacogenetic relationship with Capreomycin, influencing its ototoxic potential."
    },
    {
        "gene": "SLC22A16",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "SLC22A16 is known to play a significant role in the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin by impacting its transport and potentially impacts the pharmacokinetics of other drugs as well. Given this established role in modulating the transport of chemotherapy drugs, it is reasonable to propose a potential pharmacogenetic interaction with Capreomycin, where genetic variants in SLC22A16 could affect the absorption, distribution, or excretion of Capreomycin, potentially altering its therapeutic efficacy or increasing risk of toxicities."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCB7",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "Although the ABCB7 gene might not directly interact with Capreomycin, considering its role in cellular transport processes, it's likely that it could influence the excretion of Capreomycin or Capreomycin-induced physiological responses, altering the drug efficacy and safety profile of Capreomycin."
    },
    {
        "gene": "MTRR",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "Given that MTRR plays a role in nucleotide synthesis and certain MTRR gene variants can impact the efficacy and toxicity of drugs such as methotrexate and tegafur, it's possible that there's a potential pharmacodynamic interaction between MTRR and Capreomycin. This interaction could be through mechanisms linked to MTRR's enzymatic or cellular metabolic roles influencing Capreomycin's therapeutic efficacy and adverse effects."
    },
    {
        "gene": "HLA-C",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "The HLA-C gene, given its crucial role in immune response mechanisms, may contribute to the risk of immune-mediated adverse reactions to Capreomycin. This could be particularly relevant for hypersensitivity reactions or conditions where immune response modulation by Capreomycin could have significant clinical implications."
    },
    {
        "gene": "DCK",
        "rank": 9,
        "explanation": "The DCK gene plays a fundamental role in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anticancer drugs like gemcitabine and cytarabine, affecting their transformation into active forms, influencing drug efficacy and toxicity in cancer treatment. Considering this established role, it is plausible that DCK could similarly interact with Capreomycin, potentially affecting its activation or inactivation and consequently its effectiveness and side-effects."

    {
        "gene": "ABCG2",
        "rank": 10,
        "explanation": "ABCG2, an efflux transporter, influences the pharmacokinetics of various drugs by modifying their absorption, distribution and excretion. Genetic variants within this gene could modify drug interactions with Capreomycin, potentially affecting its therapeutic efficacy and safety. Genetic variations like Q141K in the ABCG2 gene can cause alterations in the pharmacokinetics of Capreomycin affecting therapeutic outcomes."
