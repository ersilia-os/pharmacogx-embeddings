        "gene": "CYP2D6",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "CYP2D6 is crucial in the metabolic breakdown of primaquine and its associated drug efficacy and toxicity. Genetic variants of this gene can influence primalquine's plasma levels, affecting the treatment's potential toxicity and effectiveness. Consequently, individuals found to be poor metabolizers may experience higher levels of toxicity, while ultrarapid metabolizers may see reduced drug efficacy."
    },
    {
        "gene": "G6PD",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "Primaquine often causes hemolytic anemia in people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency due to increased vulnerability of red blood cells to oxidative damage. Hence, testing for G6PD deficiency is usually conducted before primaquine treatment."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP1A2",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "CYP1A2 has also been identified as a key player in the metabolization of primaquine, therefore genetic variability within this gene could significantly affect clinical outcomes."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP3A4",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "CYP3A4 is another major enzyme involved in the metabolic breakdown of primaquine. Variants of this gene would significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of the drug, thus affecting both the safety and efficacy of treatment."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP1A1",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "CYP1A1, despite being not as prominent as CYP2D6 or CYP1A2, also plays a pivotal role in the metabolization of Primaquine. Genetic variability within this gene could influence therapeutic outcomes of the drug."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP1B1",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "Similar to CYP1A1, CYP1B1 has a significant effect on primaquine metabolism. Consequently, any genetic variability of this gene would impact the drug\u2019s efficacy and toxicity."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYB5R1",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "CYB5R1 influences the metabolism of primaquine by affecting methemoglobin reduction. This gene's variance thus has a role in drug efficacy and safety."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYB5R3",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "CYB5R3 catalyzes the reduction of methemoglobin to hemoglobin, a pathway crucial for the metabolism of primaquine. Genetic mutations in this gene or an overload of its metabolic capacity can lead to impaired oxygen transport and delivery."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYB5R4",
        "rank": 9,
        "explanation": "CYB5R4 impacts the pharmacokinetics of primaquine by influencing redox reactions through electron transfers needed for drug activation or detoxification. Drug clearance and therapeutic effectiveness may thus be influenced by variations of this gene."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYB5R2",
        "rank": 10,
        "explanation": "CYB5R2 shares a similar role to CYB5R3 in the metabolism of drugs, including primaquine, due to its role in cytochrome metabolism. Variations in this gene can cause alterations in drug efficacy or toxicity."
