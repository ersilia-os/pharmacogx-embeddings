        "gene": "CYP2D6",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "The gene CYP2D6, which metabolizes a large number of clinically used drugs like antidepressants and beta-blockers, is key in personalized medicine principles due to its extensive polymorphism. This gene is likely to play a significant role in the metabolism and effectiveness of mefloquine. Poor and ultrarapid metabolizers due to genetic variations could exhibit differing therapeutic outcomes due to altered drug concentrations, potentially necessitating dose adjustments."

    {
        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "ABCB1 encodes P-glycoprotein, an efflux transporter that affects the pharmacokinetics of various drugs like antivirals and chemotherapeutics. Polymorphisms in this gene impact the drug's distribution and elimination and can alter the bioavailability and brain penetration of various drugs. Given mefloquine's neuropsychiatric side effects, ABCB1's expression in the blood-brain barrier could be crucial for controlling the drug's access to the central nervous system."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP3A4",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "CYP3A4, significantly expressed in the liver and small intestine, is known to significantly influence the metabolism of many drugs and is known to modulate the metabolic activity of mefloquine. Interaction with other drugs can either increase or decrease CYP3A4's activity, altering the metabolism of mefloquine. Given this, CYP3A4's functional variability might play a significant role in determining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mefloquine."
    },
    {
        "gene": "G6PD",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "G6PD deficiency can enhance sensitivity to oxidative stress induced by malaria and modify the therapeutic outcomes and adverse effects of mefloquine. As such, G6PD is relevant for both its indication\u2014malaria treatment\u2014and personalized dosing decisions in affected individuals. Given the degree to which G6PD status could directly impact patient outcomes when administered mefloquine, this gene should be of notable importance in drug response investigations."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C19",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "CYP2C19 is essential in metabolizing various drugs that affect plasma levels and therapeutic outcomes. Variations in CYP2C19 affect drug metabolism and could lead to altered pharmacokinetics of mefloquine, potentially altering the drug's efficacy and safety. While CYP2C19 variants may not interact directly with mefloquine, this consideration should not be ignored due to indirect effects on the drug's metabolism."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP3A5",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "CYP3A5 plays a key role in the metabolism of several drugs, including immunosuppressants and statins. Genetic variants impact dosing due to altered metabolism rates, and it may also affect the metabolism and effectiveness of mefloquine, which in turn influences its therapeutic outcomes and risk profiles."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCB4",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "ABCB4 mutations alter the function of the MDR3 protein, impacting the pharmacokinetics of drugs by affecting their distribution and disposition, potentially changing the drug\u2019s effectiveness and increasing the risk of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). This gene may partly regulate the hepatic disposition and overall pharmacokinetics of mefloquine, potentially affecting the drug's efficacy and safety."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP1A2",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "CYP1A2 affects the metabolism of numerous medicaments, therefore influencing their pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy. It is possible that CYP1A2 could also be involved in mefloquine metabolism, affecting its plasma levels and efficacy based on genetic variability and necessitating drug dosage adjustment to prevent toxicity or enhance its effectiveness."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2B6",
        "rank": 9,
        "explanation": "CYP2B6 is known to significantly influence the metabolism and safety of several drugs, including antivirals and chemotherapy medications. Genetic variations in CYP2B6 can lead to differences in drug plasma concentrations, therapeutic effects, and potential adverse reactions. It's conceivable that CYP2B6 polymorphisms could similarly affect mefloquine metabolism and consequent therapeutic or adverse effects."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C9",
        "rank": 10,
        "explanation": "CYP2C9 gene polymorphisms influence the metabolism of various drugs, affecting their therapeutic effectiveness and risk of side effects. Although not directly linked to mefloquine, the drug might still exhibit altered pharmacokinetic profiles and thereby efficacy or safety due to its potential metabolism by CYP2C9, aiding in personalized medicine efforts."
