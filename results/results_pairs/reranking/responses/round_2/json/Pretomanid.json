        "gene": "CYP3A4",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "Given the significant role made known that CYP3A4 plays in the oxidative metabolism of Pretomanid, this gene takes precedence in the context of pharmacogenetic relationship with the drug. Genetic polymorphisms of CYP3A4 are already known to affect Pretomanid's efficacy and side effects. The enzyme is majorly expressed in the liver and intestines affecting the metabolism and efficacy of numerous other drugs, indicating a potential of considerable pharmacokinetic interactions."
    },
    {
        "gene": "NAT2",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "Given that NAT2 genetic variants significantly affect the metabolism of anti-tuberculosis drugs like isoniazid and pyrazinamide, its relevance to pretomanid cannot be overlooked. Variants could potentially affect pretomanid's pharmacokinetics and toxicity, given the similarities in drug characteristics and shared indications."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCC2",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "The role of ABCC2 in modulating the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of drugs is critical, given its function as an efflux transporter that affects drug absorption, distribution, and excretion. This gene could strongly influence Pretomanid's bioavailability and distribution in the body, thereby impacting the drug\u2019s efficacy and safety."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "ABCB1, encoding the P-gp efflux transporter, modulates the pharmacokinetics of an extensive range of drugs by affecting their absorption, distribution, and elimination. Similar to ABCC2, ABCB1 could strongly impact pretomanid's bioavailability and pharmacokinetics, ultimately affecting therapeutic outcomes."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C19",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "CYP2C19 is known to significantly influence the metabolism of numerous drugs, affecting their therapeutic efficacy and safety. Given its prominent role in drug metabolism, CYP2C19 might potentially influence the pharmacokinetics of Pretomanid, although this relationship is not fully established, and this is inferred from its established role in metabolising similar drugs."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP3A5",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "CYP3A5 influences the metabolism of many drugs, altering their therapeutic outcomes. Given the potential overlap in substrate specificity between CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 (which is involved in Pretomanid metabolism), CYP3A5 could also potentially affect Pretomanid's pharmacokinetics."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C9",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "Like other cytochrome P450 genes, CYP2C9 plays a significant role in drug metabolism, affecting their therapeutic effectiveness and risk of side effects. Given the potential overlap in substrate specificity with other P450 enzymes, CYP2C9 might also influence Pretomanid's pharmacokinetics."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2D6",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "CYP2D6's role in metabolizing a large percentage of clinically used drugs suggests that it could potentially affect the metabolism and efficacy of Pretomanid, given the potential overlap in substrate specificity with other P450 enzymes."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2B6",
        "rank": 9,
        "explanation": "CYP2B6's involvement in the metabolism of several drugs, including antiretrovirals and analgesics, implies that it could potentially impact the metabolism and efficacy of Pretomanid, although explicit evidence is currently lacking."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C8",
        "rank": 10,
        "explanation": "The CYP2C8 gene, like other P450 enzymes, significantly impacts the pharmacokinetics of various drugs. Given the potential overlap in substrate specificity with other P450 enzymes, CYP2C8 could also plausibly affect the pharmacokinetics of Pretomanid, altering its efficacy and safety."
