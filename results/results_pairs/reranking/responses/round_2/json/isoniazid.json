        "gene": "NAT2",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "NAT2 metabolizes isoniazid through acetylation, so its status directly influences the drug\u2019s pharmacokinetics and side effects like hepatotoxicity and peripheral neuropathy. Differences in acetylator status, dictated by NAT2 variants, lead to variations in drug plasma levels, exposure duration, and adverse effects."

    {
        "gene": "CYP2E1",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "CYP2E1 significantly influences the metabolism of isoniazid, affecting its efficacy and toxicity. Since individuals may carry CYP2E1 variants that alter the rate of metabolism, this could result in different responses to the drug and risks of adverse effects like hepatotoxicity."
    },
    {
        "gene": "SLCO1B1",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "SLCO1B1 influences the pharmacokinetics of isoniazid by facilitating its hepatic uptake. SLCO1B1 polymorphisms could potentially lead to altered drug plasma concentrations, thereby modifying drug efficacy and toxicity. Differences in SLCO1B1-mediated drug transport efficiency should be considered for dose optimization."
    },
    {
        "gene": "GSTM1",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "GSTM1 plays an important role in isoniazid metabolism. The GSTM1 null genotype, associated with reduced enzyme activity, can increase plasma levels and slow elimination rates, potentially resulting in higher drug exposure and toxicity. Hence, GSTM1 activity could significantly influence isoniazid's efficacy and adverse effects."
    },
    {
        "gene": "GSTT1",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "GSTT1 also significantly affects the pharmacokinetics and detoxification of isoniazid. Individuals with the null genotype, which results in no enzyme expression, may experience differences in drug efficacy and an increased risk of adverse effects due to impaired detoxification."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C19",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "While no direct interaction between isoniazid and CYP2C19 has been confirmed, given the gene\u2019s significant role in drug metabolism, including drugs with similar pathways to isoniazid, it is plausible that CYP2C19 variants could influence the metabolism, efficacy, and toxicity of isoniazid."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C9",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "CYP2C9\u2019s role in drug metabolism could potentially influence isoniazid\u2019s pharmacokinetics. Variants in the CYP2C9 gene could alter metabolic pathways, leading to differences in drug plasma levels, therapeutic effects, and potential adverse reactions."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "ABCB1, encoding P-glycoprotein, modulates the pharmacokinetics of several drugs by influencing their absorption, distribution, and excretion. While isoniazid is not an ABCB1 substrate, it is possible that ABCB1 may influence other pathways affecting isoniazid's pharmacokinetics and effect."
    },
    {
        "gene": "SLCO1B3",
        "rank": 9,
        "explanation": "SLCO1B3, encoding OATP1B3, plays a role in the hepatic uptake and metabolism of a range of drugs. Although no direct link to isoniazid has been confirmed, any interaction could potentially affect isoniazid's effective plasma levels, therapeutic effects, and toxicity, based on altered drug transport efficiency."
    },
    {
        "gene": "NR1I2",
        "rank": 10,
        "explanation": "NR1I2, or PXR, regulates genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes and transport systems, affecting the pharmacokinetics of various drugs. Even though isoniazid is not known to directly interact with NR1I2, the gene\u2019s influence on dominant drug metabolism pathways indicates that NR1I2 genomic variants could affect the metabolism, thus the efficacy and toxicity, of isoniazid."
