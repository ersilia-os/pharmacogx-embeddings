        "gene": "MT-RNR1",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "Mitochondrial 12S rRNA encoded by the MT-RNR1 gene is associated with increased susceptibility to aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity. The pharmacodynamic effect is that streptomycin and similar drugs can increase the vulnerability of cochlear hair cells to damage by affecting mitochondrial function."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCC2",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "The ABCC2 gene variants play a significant role in affecting the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic outcomes of various drugs by modulating the MRP2 protein function. Any modification in the excretion and plasma concentrations of drugs can impact their effectiveness and toxicity. As streptomycin is also subject to excretion, it is reasonable to infer that ABCC2 may have pharmacogenetic interactions with it."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "The ABCB1 gene encodes P-glycoprotein, a significant player in modulating drug pharmacokinetics by acting as an efflux transporter that influences drug absorption, distribution, and excretion. Since streptomycin is likely to be subject to these pharmacokinetic processes, it is plausible that ABCB1 may have pharmacogenetic interactions with it."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCG2",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "The ABCG2 gene, notably, influences the pharmacokinetics of many drugs by altering their absorption, distribution, and excretion. Changes in ABCG2 gene can further modify these drug interactions, potentially impacting streptomycin's absorption, distribution, and excretion."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCC4",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "ABCC4 gene variants direct the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of various drugs by modulating efflux from cells, influencing drug concentrations in the body. With streptomycin, any modulation by ABCC4 of the cellular efflux may impact its concentration, and therefore, efficacy."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCC3",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "The ABCC3 gene significantly influences the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs such as methotrexate and morphine by affecting their transport. These transport mechanisms potentially influence the streptomycin concentration and its systemic effects."
    },
    {
        "gene": "SLCO1B1",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "The SLCO1B1 gene has a substantial role in the hepatic uptake of drugs, affecting their pharmacokinetics. Changes in the SLCO1B1 may impact the hepatic uptake of streptomycin and therefore its overall pharmacokinetic behavior."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CDA",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "The CDA gene plays a role in the metabolism of chemotherapeutic drugs, especially nucleoside analogs. Although streptomycin is not a nucleoside analog, if it has any structural similarity to these drugs, there might be an interaction with the CDA gene."
    },
    {
        "gene": "SLC28A3",
        "rank": 9,
        "explanation": "The SLC28A3 gene is significant in the transport of nucleoside and nucleotide analog drugs, affecting their absorption, distribution, and elimination. Streptomycin, if structurally similar to these drugs, may be affected by SLC28A3."
    },
    {
        "gene": "SLC22A11",
        "rank": 10,
        "explanation": "The SLC22A11 gene affects the renal excretion of drugs, influencing their effectiveness and possibility for toxicity. Given streptomycin's renal excretion, the SLC22A11 gene might influence how effectively the drug is excreted, potentially affecting its pharmacokinetics, effectiveness and potential for toxicity."
