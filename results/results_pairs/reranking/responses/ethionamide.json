        "gene": "NAT2",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "NAT2 (N-acetyltransferase 2) is known to play a crucial role in the metabolism of ethionamide and other antitubercular drugs. Variations in this gene can alter acetylation activity, leading to differences in drug response and toxicity."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2E1",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "CYP2E1 (Cytochrome P450 Family 2 Subfamily E Member 1) could potentially metabolize ethionamide. While no direct evidence linking CYP2E1 to ethionamide metabolism exists, the enzyme is known to metabolize a wide range of xenobiotics."
    },
    {
        "gene": "GSTA1",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "GSTA1 (Glutathione S-Transferase Alpha 1) plays a role in detoxification by conjugating reduced glutathione to electrophilic xenobiotics. It could contribute to the metabolism of ethionamide."
    },
    {
        "gene": "GSTM1",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "GSTM1 (Glutathione S-Transferase Mu 1) is also involved in detoxification processes. Its product could also be implicated in the metabolism of ethionamide."
    },
    {
        "gene": "GSTM3",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "GSTM3 (Glutathione S-Transferase Mu 3) has similar functions as other GSTM genes, and its product may contribute to ethionamide metabolism."
    },
    {
        "gene": "NAT1",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "NAT1 (N-acetyltransferase 1) could also be involved in the metabolism of ethionamide. However, it is less likely to be critical than NAT2."
    },
    {
        "gene": "GSTP1",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "GSTP1 (Glutathione S-Transferase Pi), despite being related to glutathione metabolism which could participate in the metabolism of ethionamide, it is ranked lower in absence of direct evidence."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "ABCB1 (ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily B Member 1) could potentially alter the pharmacokinetics of ethionamide by affecting its absorption and distribution. However, exact mechanism remains to be verified."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C9",
        "rank": 9,
        "explanation": "Similarly to CYP2E1, CYP2C9 (Cytochrome P450 Family 2 Subfamily C Member 9) could potentially metabolize ethionamide, but concrete evidence is lacking."
    },
    {
        "gene": "SLCO1B1",
        "rank": 10,
        "explanation": "SLCO1B1 (Solute Carrier Organic Anion Transporter Family Member 1B1) could affect absorption and distribution of ethionamide. But its impact is likely to be lesser than many other genes due to its major role in transporting endobiotics and anionic drugs, which does not strictly match the profile of ethionamide."
