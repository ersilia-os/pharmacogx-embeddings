# Linezolide
## 1. CYP2D6
CYP2D6, a member of the cytochrome P450 family, metabolizes many drugs and is involved in drug-drug interactions. In the processing of Linezolide, it could potentially contribute in biotransformation leading to inactivation of the drug.
## 2. CYP2C9
CYP2C9 is one of the most important metabolizing enzymes in the P450 family, acting as the principal enzyme in the metabolism of approximately 10% of drugs. It's plausible that Linezolide can be metabolized in part by this enzyme leading to its reduced efficacy.
## 3. CYP2C19
CYP2C19 plays a crucial role in the metabolism of several drugs. Variants in this gene can alter drug metabolism, possibly affecting the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of Linezolide.
## 4. ABCB1
ABCB1 (also known as P-glycoprotein) is an efflux transporter and plays a major role in drug disposition. Function of this gene could be critical in determining absorption and distribution of Linezolide, consequently affecting the drugâ€™s therapeutic efficacy.
## 5. CYP2D7
CYP2D7 is not a functional enzyme due to a genetic polymorphism. Therefore, even though it is part of the cytochrome P450 family, its role in Linezolide metabolism would be minimal if not non-existent.
