        "gene": "CYP3A4",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "The CYP3A4 gene is centrally involved in the metabolism of pretomanid. CYP3A4 is responsible for both the reductive and oxidative metabolism of the drug. Genetic polymorphisms in CYP3A4, which could alter the enzyme's activity, could influence pretomanid's pharmacokinetics and potential drug-drug interactions, especially with other medications metabolized through the same pathway. Variations in this gene might affect drug efficacy and safety profiles, signalling a pharmacogenetic relationship."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "Although no direct link between pretomanid and ABCB1 is mentioned in the provided information, ABCB1 codes for P-glycoprotein, a transmembrane efflux pump that plays a significant role in drug absorption and distribution. Given that pretomanid is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and interacts with CYP3A4, a gene that ABCB1 also interacts with, it is plausible to hypothesize that ABCB1 could influence pretomanid's pharmacokinetics."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP3A5",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "CYP3A5, like CYP3A4, is also part of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes and plays a significant role in drug metabolism. While no specific data links CYP3A5 to pretomanid, the gene\u2019s function in metabolizing various substrates, especially in individuals who express this variant more highly, suggests a potential role in pretomanid pharmacokinetics."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C9",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "While not directly linked to pretomanid metabolism, the CYP2C9 gene is a part of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, which plays a crucial role in drug metabolism, including some antifungal and antimalarial drugs. Although no specific evidence connects it to pretomanid, CYP2C9 may play a secondary role to CYP3A4 in the comprehension of pretomanid pharmacokinetics."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2B6",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "The CYP2B6 gene codes for an enzyme involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids, and other lipids. While its direct role in pretomanid metabolism is not established, the function it plays in metabolizing various prodrugs and synthetically active drugs could indicate a potential pharmacogenetic relationship with pretomanid."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C19",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "CYP2C19 is involved in the metabolism of several classes of drugs. Site-specific polymorphisms in this gene can lead to an individual becoming a poor metabolizer, which may impact the drug\u2019s performance. While there is no direct link to pretomanid metabolism, given the gene\u2019s broad role in drug metabolism, it is plausible to suggest a potential pharmacogenetic relationship."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2D6",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "CYP2D6 is involved in the metabolism of a large number of drugs. Genetic variations and polymorphisms in this gene can greatly affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these drugs. While pretomanid isn\u2019t directly metabolized by this gene product, a potential correlation may exist given the gene\u2019s function and the complexity of drug metabolism."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C18",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "Although CYP2C18's function isn\u2019t fully known, it belongs to the CYP2C subfamily of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, so it is involved in drug metabolism. While no direct link exists with pretomanid metabolism, CYP genes can show overlap in the substrates they metabolize, indicating a potential pharmacogenetic relationship."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C8",
        "rank": 9,
        "explanation": "CYP2C8 is part of the cytochrome P450 superfamily and is involved in the metabolism of various drugs. Although there is no direct evidence linking it with pretomanid metabolism, given its role in drug metabolism and being a part of the same family as CYP3A4, it is worth considering in the context of a pharmacogenetic relationship."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2E1",
        "rank": 10,
        "explanation": "The CYP2E1 enzyme metabolizes a variety of drugs and is implicated in the metabolism of toxic compounds. While its specific link to pretomanid metabolism is unclear, its functional relevance in other drug metabolic pathways suggests the potential for a pharmacogenetic relationship with pretomanid."
