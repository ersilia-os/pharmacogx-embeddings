        "gene": "G6PD",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "G6PD has the most pharmacogenetic relevance to pyrimethamine. G6PD deficiency can predispose to hemolytic anemia from oxidative stress, which can be precipitated by drugs including pyrimethamine. Therefore, potential difference in drug response is associated with polymorphisms in the G6PD gene, particularly in malaria endemic areas."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "ABCB1 encodes P-glycoprotein that is involved in drug transport across cell membranes. Variants in this gene can affect pharmacokinetics of drugs including pyrimethamine, altering absorption or distribution, possibly leading to inter-individual differences in response to the drug."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C19",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "Although there is no direct evidence of CYP2C19 metabolising pyrimethamine, this gene's known ability to metabolise a wide variety of drugs make it a potential candidate. Variations in CYP2C19 could potentially impact pyrimethamine metabolism and hence response."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCG2",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "ABCG2, similar to ABCB1, codes for a transporter protein involved in drug exports from cells. Variations in its function through genetic polymorphisms may affect the efficacy and toxicity of pyrimethamine."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCC2",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "ABCC2 gene encodes a protein that is related to the active transport of drugs and toxins; variants in this gene could affect the drug-tissue distribution or elimination of pyrimethamine, thereby affecting the drug's action."
    },
    {
        "gene": "SLCO1B1",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "SLCO1B1 encodes for a transporter protein predominantly expressed in the liver and it plays a role in the hepatic uptake of drugs. Therefore, genetic variants that affect the function of this protein may feasibly alter pyrimethamine disposition."
    },
    {
        "gene": "SLC22A1",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "SLC22A1 gene encodes a protein involved in the transport of endogenous and exogenous substances. Although there is no direct evidence linking SLC22A1 polymorphisms with pyrimethamine, its role in drug transport could make this gene a potential candidate for influence on the pharmacokinetics of pyrimethamine."
    },
    {
        "gene": "HLA-C",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "There is no direct evidence to link HLA-C with response to pyrimethamine. However, given its role in the immune response, it could potentially influence individual susceptibility to infections such as malaria, which pyrimethamine is used to treat."
    },
    {
        "gene": "HLA-DRB1",
        "rank": 9,
        "explanation": "There is no direct evidence to link specific HLA-DRB1 alleles with differences in pyrimethamine response. Some studies have suggested a role for variation in HLA-DRB1 in susceptibility to malaria, but this does not directly translate to a pharmacogenetic interaction."
    },
    {
        "gene": "HLA-A",
        "rank": 10,
        "explanation": "Similar to HLA-C and HLA-DRB1, HLA-A has no direct evidence to link with response to pyrimethamine but due to its role in the immune response, it could influence individual susceptibility to infections such as malaria, which pyrimethamine is used to treat."
