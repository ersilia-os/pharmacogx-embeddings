        "gene": "CYP3A4",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "CYP3A4 is a primary enzyme involved in the metabolism of mefloquine. Variations in this gene may influence the drug's plasma levels and impact its efficacy and toxicity. Individuals with specific genetic polymorphisms could experience higher concentrations of mefloquine, and this could correlate with an elevated risk of side effects. Therefore, CYP3A4 is pharmacogenetically important, as variations could affect dosing guidelines and medical outcomes."

    {
        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "ABCB1 codes for the P-glycoprotein 1 transporter, which plays a significant part in the cellular efflux of mefloquine. It is involved in the transport and distribution of mefloquine, potentially affecting drug effectiveness and toxicity profile. Genetic variations in ABCB1 might alter the bioavailability of mefloquine by modifying its transport, indicating a probable pharmacogenetic relationship."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2D6",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "Though not primarily involved in the metabolism of mefloquine, CYP2D6 plays a significant role in the metabolism of many drugs. Variations in this gene have a significant effect on drug metabolism, so pharmacogenetic interactions with mefloquine should not be overlooked. While data regarding its specific role in mefloquine metabolism is limited, it is possible that CYP2D6 contributes to the processing of this drug."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C19",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "While there is no available direct evidence linking CYP2C19 with mefloquine metabolism, this gene is known to be involved in the metabolism of many drugs. CYP2C19 is included due to the possibility of it having a minor role in mefloquine metabolism and the unexplored potential for pharmacogenetic interactions."
    },
    {
        "gene": "G6PD",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "G6PD is included in the list due to its role in a condition that can be exacerbated by certain antimalarial drugs. G6PD deficiency is a genetic disorder that can cause hemolytic anemia when individuals are exposed to certain triggers. While mefloquine is generally considered safe in individuals with G6PD deficiency, individual variations in G6PD and the complexities of drug-gene interactions make this gene of potential pharmacogenetic interest."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2D7",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "Like CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, CYP2D7 is included in this list as it is part of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes which are crucial for drug metabolism. Although CYP2D7 is mostly a pseudogene in humans, there is documented variability among individuals. Accordingly, even though a minor player, it might be involved in the metabolism of mefloquine to some extent."
