        "gene": "NAT2",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) is heavily implicated in isoniazid pharmacogenomics. NAT2 is known to acetylate isoniazid, which is a crucial step in its metabolic pathway. Genetic variants in the NAT2 gene are well-known to influence isoniazid metabolism, resulting in various acetylator phenotypes (slow, intermediate, and rapid). These phenotypes distinguish the kinetics of isoniazid in the body, specifically affecting its efficacy and the risk of side effects. Therefore, the pharmacogenetic interaction between isoniazid and NAT2 is significant."

        "gene": "CYP2E1",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) is involved in the metabolic activation of isoniazid. CYP2E1 produces a toxic metabolite (acetylhydrazine) that may lead to hepatotoxicity, which is a major concern with isoniazid therapy, particularly in slow acetylators (usually determined by NAT2 genetic polymorphisms). Genetic variations in CYP2E1 could alter its activity, thus influencing isoniazid pharmacokinetics and hepatotoxicity risk."

    {
        "gene": "GSTT1",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "Glutathione S-transferase theta 1 (GSTT1) is also involved in isoniazid metabolism, specifically in detoxification process via conjugation with glutathione. Genetic variants causing absence or low activity of GSTT1 could impact the detoxification of isoniazid-associated toxic metabolites, thereby affecting individual susceptibility to isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity."
    },
    {
        "gene": "GSTM1",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "The gene GSTM1 codes for glutathione S-transferase mu 1, an enzyme that facilitates clearance of toxic metabolites produced during isoniazid metabolism. Its role is especially important in the detoxification of hydrazine and acetylhydrazine. Genetic polymorphisms causing GSTM1 deficiency (GSTM1-null genotype) could increase the risk of isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity by reducing detoxification capacity, affecting isoniazid pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics."

    {
        "gene": "BACH1",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "BACH1, while not traditionally known to interact directly with drug metabolism, could indirectly impact isoniazid pharmacology through its regulatory role in oxidative stress response. Isoniazid and its metabolites can generate reactive species contributing to oxidative stress, a mechanism implicated in isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity. Variations in BACH1 influencing the oxidative stress response might affect individual susceptibility to this hepatotoxicity."
    },
    {
        "gene": "SLCO1B1",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "SLCO1B1 codes for a transporter protein (OATP1B1) that mediates hepatic uptake of various drugs. Although isoniazid is generally not considered a direct substrate of OATP1B1, genetic variations in SLCO1B1 (like reduced function polymorphisms) impacting transporter function can potentially affect isoniazid distribution and elimination, thereby influencing its pharmacokinetics, response, and toxicity risk."
    },
    {
        "gene": "NR1I2",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "NR1I2, encoding the nuclear receptor PXR, regulates genes involved in drug metabolism and transport, including some cytochromes P450 and transporters like OATP1B1 (coded by SLCO1B1). Variations in NR1I2 might affect isoniazid pharmacokinetics indirectly through its regulatory effects on these metabolic enzymes and transporters."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "ABCB1 encodes P-glycoprotein, a transporter that affects distribution and elimination of many drugs by pumping them out of cells. Although direct interaction between isoniazid and P-glycoprotein is unclear, it might potentially influence cellular handling of isoniazid, affecting its distribution, elimination, and possibly its access to the intracellular target (mycolic acid synthesis machinery in tuberculosis bacteria). Thus, genetic variations in ABCB1 might influence isoniazid pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2B6",
        "rank": 9,
        "explanation": "CYP2B6 may have a role in minor metabolism of isoniazid, though not as significant as NAT2 or CYP2E1. However, CYP2B6 genetic polymorphisms are known to significantly affect activity of this enzyme, potentially influencing isoniazid metabolism and response, especially if other pivotal metabolic pathways (like NAT2-mediated acetylation) are compromised due to genetic factors."
    },
    {
        "gene": "FMO1",
        "rank": 10,
        "explanation": "Flavin-containing monooxygenase 1 (FMO1) might be involved in minor pathways of isoniazid metabolism. These could be more relevant in situations where major metabolic pathways are compromised (like in slow acetylators). Genetic variations in FMO1 might therefore indirectly influence isoniazid pharmacokinetics and the spectrum of its active and toxic metabolites."
