        "gene": "CYP3A4",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "CYP3A4 plays a crucial role in metabolizing many therapeutic agents. Considering that Clofazimine is extensively metabolized in the human body, it is plausible to anticipate a pharmaco-genetic relationship with the drug. Potential polymorphisms impacting this gene's function/expression could alter the plasma concentrations of the drug, thus influencing efficacy and potential side effects."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP3A5",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "Like CYP3A4, the CYP3A5 enzyme metabolizes a wide range of drugs. Given that Clofazimine is a substrate for CYP3A4, there's a strong possibility that CYP3A5 could be involved as well. Genetic variations in this gene could lead to significant inter-individual differences in Clofazimine metabolism and response."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C19",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "Though CYP2C19 is not as broadly involved in drug metabolism as the CYP3A family, it does contribute significantly to the metabolism of a number of clinically important drugs. Variation in this gene could impact the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Clofazimine."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C9",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "CYP2C9 is known for metabolizing approximately 15% of drugs in use today. Involvement with Clofazimine metabolism is probable, and genetic variation in this gene could impact drug clearance and response."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2B6",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "Although not among the most abundantly expressed CYP enzymes in the liver, CYP2B6 is involved in metabolizing a number of therapeutics. Its involvement in Clofazimine metabolism can be hypothesized, with polymorphisms potentially affecting drug processing and response."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "ABCB1 is implicated in drug efflux and contributes to the pharmacokinetics of various drugs. If Clofazimine is a substrate for this transporter, genetic variants that modify its function could influence drug disposition and response."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCG2",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "Another important efflux transporter, ABCG2 is implicated in drug resistance and elimination. It is feasible that it could participate in Clofazimine's traffic either at the cellular level or at the barrier sites, like the blood-brain or placenta boundaries. ABCG2 polymorphisms could therefore possibly affect Clofazimine's distribution and elimination."
    },
    {
        "gene": "G6PD",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "G6PD is less likely to be associated with Clofazimine pharmacogenetics. It's primarily concerned with redox balance, creating NADPH to prevent oxidative stress in cells. While certain drugs can trigger hemolytic anemia in individuals with G6PD deficiency, there's no known link with Clofazimine. Nonetheless, given genetic variation in this gene, abnormal redox balance might indirectly affect drug response."
