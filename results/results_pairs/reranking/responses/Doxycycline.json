        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "ABCB1 (also known as MDR1 or P-glycoprotein), is an ATP-driven drug efflux pump for xenobiotic compounds with broad substrate specificity and is believed to be responsible for the extrusion of pharmacologically active substances across cell barriers. Its activity can therefore impact the absorption, distribution, and elimination of many drugs, including doxycycline. It is already well-known for its role in multidrug resistance in cancer therapy, but there is also evidence of substantial interindividual variability in ABCB1 gene expression and impact on drug pharmacokinetics. This holds implications for individualized therapeutics and drug safety."

        "gene": "ABCC2",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "ABCC2 (also known as MRP2) is another member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of transporters, which, like ABCB1, is involved in the efflux of drugs and metabolites. However, its substrate specificity differs somewhat from ABCB1. ABCC2 is primarily expressed in the canalicular (apical) membrane of hepatocytes and is an important determinant of biliary excretion of many drugs and metabolites. Given that doxycycline is known to undergo hepatobiliary recycling, alterations in ABCC2 may potentially affect the distribution and elimination of this drug."

        "gene": "HLA-B",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "HLA-B is a gene that encodes the HLA-B protein, a major component of the human Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I. This gene is known for its strong association with immune response, including response to infectious agents, but is not typically associated with drug metabolism or transport processes. The HLA-B protein presentation of antigens for CD8+ T cells could potentially interact with the antibiotic activity of doxycycline (e.g., if doxycycline has immunomodulatory effects), but this is relatively speculative compared to the more direct roles of ABCB1 and ABCC2 in drug pharmacokinetics."
