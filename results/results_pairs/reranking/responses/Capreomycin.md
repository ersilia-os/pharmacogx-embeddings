# Capreomycin
## 1. ABCB1
ABCB1 encodes the P-glycoprotein 1, which behaves as a drug-efflux pump participating in drug disposition by extruding drugs from the cells, and thereby affecting the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) characteristics of various drugs, including those belonging to the aminoglycoside class. While Capreomycin does not share structural similarities with classic aminoglycosides, it is part of the same drug class and its pharmacokinetic profile could potentially be influenced by ABCB1-mediated efflux. However, given the lack of specifics about enzymes or transporters involved in Capreomycin disposition, there exists uncertainty in this relationship, but is likely given ABCB1 known role in aminoglycoside disposition.
## 2. ABCC2
ABCC2 encodes the multi-drug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), known to transport various endogenous substances and xenobiotics, including drugs, out of cells. Its role in drug disposition, especially the efflux of aminoglycosides, makes it a potential candidate in Capreomycin metabolism. Similar to ABCB1, Capreomycin is part of the same drug class as aminoglycosides, and therefore ABCC2 may similarly have impact on Capreomycin's pharmacokinetic profile. However, given the uncertain nature of the specificity of Capreomycin's disposition mechanisms, the rationale behind ranking ABCC2 lower than ABCB1 is largely based on the more established relationship of ABCB1 with aminoglycoside efflux.
## 3. MT-RNR1
MT-RNR1 encodes a mitochondrial ribosomal RNA. Given Capreomycin's mechanism of action, directly targeting a bacterial ribosomal enzyme, it seems plausible that components of the human ribosome could interact with the drug. However, Capreomycin's specific target in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an enzyme involved in RNA modification, not a structural component of the ribosome itself, suggesting a lesser likelihood of direct interaction with human ribosomal elements. Additionally, the human target MT-RNR1 represents a mitochondrial ribosomal component, and it is unlikely that Capreomycin directly targets mitochondrial ribosomes as this would induce significant toxicity. Therefore, while a connection to the mechanism of action exists based on the drug's targeting of a ribosomal enzyme, the precise target disparity places MT-RNR1 lower in the ranking compared to ABCB1 and ABCC2 that have more direct associations to aminoglycoside disposition.
