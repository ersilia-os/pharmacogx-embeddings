# Sulfadoxine

## 1. G6PD
G6PD stands as the most likely drug-gene interaction for sulfadoxine due to direct pharmacodynamic considerations - G6PD deficiency can increase risks of hemolysis in patients treated with sulfadoxine. Given the drug's known interactions with G6PD, genetic screening is essential among users to avoid severe hemolytic reactions.

## 2. NAT2
NAT2 encodes an enzyme fundamental for drug metabolism through N-acetylation. While NAT2 variants are known to impact the metabolism of sulfonamide antibiotics like sulfamethoxazole, its interaction with sulfadoxine is probable. This interaction can lead to differentiated acetylator status among individuals, critical for pharmacotherapy.

## 3. CYP2C9
Although sulfadoxine's known metabolic pathway has limited documentation, potential interactions with the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, particularly CYP2C9, can likely influence the drug's metabolism. Genetic polymorphisms in this gene can alter the therapeutic effectiveness and risk of side reactions to sulfadoxine.

## 4. ABCB1
ABCB1 dictates the pharmacokinetics of several medications by acting as an efflux transporter that affects their absorption, distribution, and excretion. Given its central role in drug transport, ABCB1 may modulate the bioavailability of sulfadoxine, and genetic variability might necessitate adjustments in drug therapy.

## 5. CYP2C19
CYP2C19 should be considered given its major influence on the metabolism of various drugs. Even though a direct interaction with sulfadoxine is uncertain, considering CYP2C19's extensive role in pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenetic testing of this gene could significantly impact treatment with sulfadoxine.

## 6. ABCG2
ABCG2 plays a major role in drug pharmacokinetics by affecting absorption, distribution, and excretion. Variants like Q141K in ABCG2 could modify the interaction with sulfadoxine, potentially affecting drug efficacy, safety, and the need for dosage adjustments.

## 7. NAT1
The enzyme NAT1, involved in drug metabolism and efficacy, could potentially process sulfadoxine. Genetic variations that affect NAT1 activity could alter sulfadoxine's therapeutic effects, highlighting the need for personalized medicine based on the NAT1 genetic profile.

## 8. HLA-B
HLA-B gene plays a significant role in drug hypersensitivity reactions. Although interactions are speculative for sulfadoxine, allele-specific reactions could cause adverse effects. This gene's potential role in genetic predisposition underscores its importance in individualized treatment.

## 9. IKBKG
The IKBKG gene is part of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway which is crucial for the immune response in combating malaria. Mutations in the IKBKG gene can modify the immune system's response, thus potentially influencing the efficacy of antimalarials such as sulfadoxine.

## 10. CYP2D6
Following the rationale of other cytochrome P450 genes, CYP2D6 is a candidate gene even if it doesn't actively metabolize sulfadoxine. CYP2D6 is significant as it is known to metabolize about 25% of clinically used drugs, meaning its genetic variants have broad impacts across medicine.
