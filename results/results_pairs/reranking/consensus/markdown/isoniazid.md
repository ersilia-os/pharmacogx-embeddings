# Isoniazid

## 1. NAT2
NAT2 is a well-documented pharmacogenetic interaction for isoniazid. It encodes for an enzyme that is directly involved in isoniazid acetylation, a key step in the drug's metabolism. Variants in NAT2 cause variability in acetylation rates, categorizing individuals as rapid or slow acetylators, which directly affects the risk for isoniazid adverse effects such as hepatotoxicity and peripheral neuropathy.

## 2. CYP2E1
The CYP2E1 enzyme plays a leading role in the metabolism of isoniazid and other drugs such as acetaminophen. Notably, variants of CYP2E1 affecting enzyme activity can lead to variability in the rate at which isoniazid is metabolized. This altered metabolism affects the efficacy of isoniazid therapy and the toxicity profile, particularly in relation to hepatotoxicity. Variations can lead to differential risks of adverse effects as well as drug-drug interactions given the enzyme's broad substrate specificity.

## 3. GSTM1
The GSTM1 gene is key in the metabolism of several drugs including isoniazid. Numerous studies have shown an association between GSTM1 null genotype, leading to reduced enzyme activity, and increased susceptibility to isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity. This connection ties to the role GSTM1 plays in the detoxification of isoniazid metabolites. Therefore, GSTM1 plays a crucial role in isoniazid safety and efficacy, and genetic variations can significantly alter these attributes.

## 4. GSTT1
GSTT1 (Glutathione S-transferase theta 1) plays a key role in the detoxification of various drugs including isoniazid. Variations in the GSTT1 gene, particularly the null genotype, affect the activity of the GSTT1 enzyme and alter isoniazid detoxification. Individuals with the GSTT1 null genotype have no enzyme expression, which leads to differences in drug efficacy and potentially increased risk of adverse effects. Therefore, the GSTT1 gene is likely to influence the pharmacogenetics of isoniazid.

## 5. SLCO1B1
SLCO1B1 is a gene responsible for encoding a solute carrier protein involved in the hepatic uptake of various drugs, which significantly impacts their pharmacokinetics. It is plausible that isoniazid could be one of these drugs, thereby altering its plasma concentrations, efficacy, and safety profile.

## 6. NR1I2
NR1I2, or PXR, regulates genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes and transport systems, affecting the pharmacokinetics of various drugs. Even though isoniazid is not known to directly interact with NR1I2, the gene’s influence on dominant drug metabolism pathways indicates that NR1I2 genomic variants could affect the metabolism, thus the efficacy and toxicity, of isoniazid.

## 7. ABCB1
ABCB1, encoding P-glycoprotein, modulates the pharmacokinetics of several drugs by influencing their absorption, distribution, and excretion. While isoniazid is not an ABCB1 substrate, it is possible that ABCB1 may influence other pathways affecting isoniazid's pharmacokinetics and effect.

## 8. CYP2C19
While no direct interaction between isoniazid and CYP2C19 has been confirmed, given the gene’s significant role in drug metabolism, including drugs with similar pathways to isoniazid, it is plausible that CYP2C19 variants could influence the metabolism, efficacy, and toxicity of isoniazid.

## 9. CYP2C9
CYP2C9 may impact the metabolism and efficacy of isoniazid due to its role in drug metabolism. This gene, encoding for an enzyme belonging to the cytochrome P450 family, plays a crucial role in the biotransformation of many drugs. Polymorphisms in CYP2C9 can affect the metabolism rate of isoniazid, influencing its plasma levels and thereby potentially altering efficacy and toxicity.

## 10. GSTM2
Glutathione S-transferase Mu 2 (GSTM2) has implications for the metabolism and detoxification of isoniazid. Given its role in detoxifying substances, GSTM2 polymorphisms could influence the effectiveness and toxicity of isoniazid, possibly by modifying the metabolism and excretion of drug metabolites.
