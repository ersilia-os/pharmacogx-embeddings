## 1. ABCB1
ABCB1 significantly impacts the absorption, distribution, and excretion of several drugs. As an efflux transporter integral in the removal of drugs, including antivirals, antipsychotics, chemotherapeutics, and cardiovascular drugs, from the body, ABCB1 profoundly influences their bioavailability and plasma concentrations. By affecting how much of the drug is accessible for therapeutic effects vs. sent for excretion, this gene helps determine the drug’s half-life, duration of action, therapeutic efficacy, and side effect risk. As such, genetic changes altering the gene’s function or expression can have notable repercussions on how these drugs function in the body.

## 2. CYP2D6
CYP2D6 is engaged intensely in metabolizing various drugs, such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, beta-blockers, and opioids, and it affects how these drugs are processed within the body. Genetic changes in CYP2D6 can cause variations in enzymatic activity, which affects the metabolism of these drugs and their pharmacokinetics. Different variants can result in different metabolizer phenotypes—from ultrarapid to poor metabolizers. These metabolic changes can impact the amount of drug available within the body and the drug’s therapeutic numbers, altering the therapeutic efficacy and side effect profile, hence necessitating dose adjustments or alternative therapy choices.

## 3. CYP2B6
CYP2B6 plays a significant role in the metabolism of various drugs, being involved in the biotransformation of agents like efavirenz, nevirapine, methadone, bupropion, cyclophosphamide. Genetic changes in CYP2B6 can result in different expressions or catalytic activities of the enzyme, affecting the drugs’ pharmacokinetics and therapeutic outcomes. Having an altered enzyme expression can influence the amount of drug metabolized and, thus, its concentration within the body. This can lead to fluctuations in therapeutic efficacy, varying the drug’s effectiveness and safety, making the gene a crucial pharmacogenetic determinant.

## 4. CYP3A4
CYP3A4, with its extensive expression in the liver and small intestine, plays a significant role in the metabolism of many drugs, impacting their pharmacokinetics by affecting their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties. Enzymatic interaction with inducers or inhibitors like carbamazepine and erythromycin, respectively, can alter CYP3A4’s activity affecting the metabolism of other drugs, necessitating dosage adjustments.

## 5. CYP2C19
CYP2C19 is involved in the metabolism of a diverse range of drugs like clozapine, proton pump inhibitors, antidepressants, antiepileptics, and antifungal drugs. Changes in CYP2C19 perfectly align with variations in drug activation and metabolic rates, thereby causing differences in pharmacological outcomes. Consequently, these pharmacokinetic changes may call for adjustments in dosing to optimize treatment efficacy and avoid adverse effects.

## 6. CYP3A5
CYP3A5 plays a critical role in the biotransformation of numerous drugs, including immunosuppressants, antifungals, statins, anticoagulants, and synthetic opioids. These drugs are processed by the CYP3A5 enzyme, affecting their bioavailability and plasma concentrations, which directly influence their therapeutic efficacy and side effect profile. Genetic changes in CYP3A5 can lead to variations in enzymatic activity, which alter drug metabolism and determine the concentration of drug available for therapeutic action.

## 7. UGT2B7
UGT2B7 is a significant player in the metabolism and clearance of several drugs, including opioids and antiretrovirals, influencing their efficacy, side effects, and toxicity. Genetic variation in this enzyme has a profound impact on the pharmacokinetics and drug therapeutic outcomes, which may necessitate personalized dosing. Given the crucial role of UGT2B7 in metabolizing Artenimol, as mentioned in the auxiliary information, and considering its influence on various other drugs, UGT2B7 stands out to be at the top in terms of pharmacogenetic importance.

## 8. ABCG2
Genetic variations in ABCG2, a gene critical in drug transport, can substantially influence drug disposition within the body, affecting the drug's pharmacokinetics and therapeutic outcomes. Mutations can affect the gene's function, modifying how efficiently it removes drugs from the body, thereby altering drug exposure, effectiveness, and toxicity risk.

## 9. NR1I2
The nuclear receptor NR1I2, or the pregnane X receptor (PXR), regulates the expression of key genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters like CYP3A4 and MDR1 that have significant effects on drug pharmacokinetics. Activators and inhibitors of NR1I2 can alter drug processing in the body, with ramifications on their therapeutic efficacy and side effect profile.

## 10. CYP2A6
CYP2A6 is involved in the breakdown of various chemicals and drugs, playing a pivotal role in metabolizing drugs such as nicotine, chemotherapeutics (cyclophosphamide and tegafur), and HIV treatment efavirenz. Genetic changes in CYP2A6, leading to variable enzyme function, can alter drug metabolism and affect drug efficacy and side effects, requiring dosage adjustments or alternative drug selections.
