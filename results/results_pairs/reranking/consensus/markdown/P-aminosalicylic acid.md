# P-aminosalicylic acid

## 1. NAT2
NAT2 is an enzyme known to play a substantial part in the metabolism of various drugs, substantially affecting their pharmacokinetics and toxicity levels. Its variants have previously been noted to modify the metabolism of drugs such as isoniazid, hydralazine, procainamide, sulfamethoxazole, and pyrazinamide. This results in individuals presenting with differing acetylator status, namely rapid, intermediate, or slow, which impacts drug plasma levels, exposure duration, and risk of adverse effects - including increased toxicity and drug-induced lupus.

## 2. NAT1
NAT1 bears prominence in the metabolism and effectiveness of multiple drugs, adding to and subtracting from the drugs' effectiveness and side effect profiles by altering the regulations in their metabolic pathways. Variants of NAT1 have been found to significantly influence the effectiveness of drugs like cotinine, thioguanine, and mesalazine, underscoring the important role this gene holds in the pharmacogenetics of these drugs.

## 3. ABCB1
ABCB1 is a gene of interest in pharmacogenetics due to its crucial role in affecting the absorption, distribution, and excretion of various drugs. ABCB1 acts as an efflux transporter and is integral in influencing the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of many drugs including but not limited to antivirals like efavirenz and ritonavir, chemotherapeutics like doxorubicin and paclitaxel, cardiovascular drugs like digoxin, immunosuppressants like tacrolimus and sirolimus, and analgesics like morphine and codeine.

## 4. CYP2C9
CYP2C9 polymorphisms have a pronounced influence on the metabolism of various drugs, thereby affecting their therapeutic efficacy and the risk of side effects. Some primary examples of drugs that necessitate dose customization based on CYP2C9 variants are warfarin, phenytoin, celecoxib, losartan, and tolbutamide.

## 5. CYP2C19
CYP2C19 plays a major role in affecting the metabolism of various drugs such as clopidogrel, proton pump inhibitors like omeprazole and esomeprazole, antidepressants like citalopram, escitalopram, antiepileptics like phenytoin, antifungals like voriconazole, and analgesics like methadone and oxycodone. Its variants have been found to significantly impact drug activation and metabolism, leading to differing pharmacological outcomes across individuals.

## 6. ABCC2
ABCC2 gene variants play a significant role in influencing the excretion and plasma concentration, and therefore pharmacokinetics, of numerous drugs. Examples include methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, rosuvastatin, and others such as irinotecan and docetaxel, by altering the functionality of the MRP2 enzyme. This alteration can subsequently impact drug effectiveness and toxicity.

## 7. CYP2C8
CYP2C8 is known for playing a critical role in the metabolism of drugs like paclitaxel, pioglitazone, repaglinide, and amodiaquine. Genetic variations that influence drug metabolism and exposure directly impact the efficacy and toxicity profiles of these drugs, suggesting the potential utility of CYP2C8 genetic testing in optimizing drug dosing and reducing toxicity risks.

## 8. CYP2E1
CYP2E1 plays a significant part in influencing the metabolism of many drugs, potentially affecting their efficacy, toxicity, and risk of adverse effects. For instance, in drugs like acetaminophen and isoniazid, variations in CYP2E1's activity can lead to differences in metabolism rates, thereby impacting their efficacy and toxicity.

## 9. SLC22A1
SLC22A1 encodes the organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1). OCT1 is expressed mainly in the liver, where it facilitates the cellular uptake of various drugs. P-aminosalicylic acid is a cation at physiological pH and can be a substrate of OCT1. Therefore, genetic variants that modify the activity of the transporter can influence the hepatic clearance of the drug, altering its plasma levels and possibly its therapeutic effect and toxicity.

## 10. CYP2D6
CYP2D6 plays a significant role in drug metabolism, particularly in the metabolism of drugs like codeine, antidepressants like paroxetine and fluoxetine, the antipsychotic risperidone, tamoxifen, and beta-blockers such as metoprolol and timolol. The variations in CYP2D6 activity can result in different therapeutic responses and outcomes, with poor metabolizers at risk of the potential toxicity and ultra-rapid metabolizers at risk of reduced drug efficacy.
