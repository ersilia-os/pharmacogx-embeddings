        "gene": "CYP3A4",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "CYP3A4 significantly alters the metabolism and overall effect of Rifapentine. This major hepatic enzyme's activity can be modified by genetic polymorphisms, leading to variations in drug exposure, effectiveness, and adverse effects. By altering metabolism rates, polymorphisms in CYP3A4 can modify Rifapentine's pharmacokinetic profile. Therefore, variations in CYP3A4 have direct pharmacogenetic implications on the treatment outcomes and toxicity of Rifapentine."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C9",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "Certain alleles of CYP2C9 may decrease enzyme activity, leading to increased Rifapentine exposure and potential adverse effects. Patients with these variants may have altered drug metabolism, leading to a higher risk of toxicity and adverse reactions due to increased systemic exposure. Hence, CYP2C9 variations may have a significant influence on the pharmacogenetics of Rifapentine, emphasizing its importance in personalized dosing decisions."
    },
    {
        "gene": "NR1I2",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "NR1I2 carries implications for Rifapentine's pharmacokinetics due to its role in regulating genes encoding metabolic enzymes, such as CYP3A4, and drug transport systems. Activators or inhibitors of NR1I2 can enhance or reduce the metabolism rate of Rifapentine, leading to alterations in drug efficacy and potential adverse effects via regulation of CYP3A4."
    },
    {
        "gene": "SLCO1B1",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "This gene codes for a hepatic uptake transporter that can influence the pharmacokinetics and resulting drug levels of Rifapentine, affecting the drug's efficacy and potential toxicity. Polymorphisms such as c.521T>C can alter the function and efficiency of this transporter, possibly leading to elevated plasma levels of the drug and subsequently, increased risk of adverse effects and altered therapeutic efficacy."
    },
    {
        "gene": "NAT2",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "NAT2 is involved in drug metabolism, contributing to Rifapentine's pharmacokinetic profile. With existing evidence supporting NAT2's role in metabolizing other antituberculosis drugs like isoniazid, it would be a plausible inference that NAT2 could impact Rifapentine metabolism, thus altering drug plasma levels, exposure duration, and possible adverse effects."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP3A5",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "CYP3A5 plays a role in the metabolism of several drugs, including Rifapentine. Variations in CYP3A5 function can contribute to interindividual differences in Rifapentine's pharmacokinetics like rate of metabolism, drug exposure, and drug clearance. This interaction can influence the therapeutic outcomes and risk profiles of Rifapentine."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCC2",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "The ABCC2 gene, encoding the MRP2 protein, affects drug pharmacokinetics by influencing their excretion. Genetic variations can lead to altered drug plasma concentrations and efficacy of therapeutic outcomes, and given the structural resemblance of Rifapentine to other MRP2 substrates, it's reasonable to infer its potential role in modulating Rifapentine pharmacokinetics."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "ABCB1 encodes P-glycoprotein, a crucial efflux transporter that influences drug absorption, distribution, and excretion. Rifapentine, being lipophilic, is a possible substrate for P-glycoprotein, which modulates Rifapentine's bioavailability and penetration into tissues, directly influencing drug efficacy and safety."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C8",
        "rank": 9,
        "explanation": "CYP2C8 affects the metabolism of Rifapentine. Any variations in CYP2C8 gene could potentially influence the metabolism and exposure to Rifapentine, which could consequently affect the efficacy and potential toxicity of the drug. As such, the CYP2C8 gene is of interest in the pharmacogenetics of Rifapentine."
    },
    {
        "gene": "GSTM1",
        "rank": 10,
        "explanation": "GSTM1 is involved in the metabolism of Rifapentine. The presence of the GSTM1 null genotype can lead to reduced drug metabolism and higher plasma levels of Rifapentine. This alteration in pharmacokinetics can potentially result in an impact on drug efficacy and an elevated risk of toxicity, making GSTM1 significant in terms of pharmacogenetic relevance."
