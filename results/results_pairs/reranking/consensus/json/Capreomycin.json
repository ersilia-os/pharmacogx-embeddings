        "gene": "ABCC2",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "ABCC2, encoding the MRP2 protein, influences the function and pharmacokinetics of various drugs including antitubercular agents. Variations in ABCC2 can modify both drug excretion and plasma concentrations, leading to alterations in drug effectiveness and toxicity. Therefore, based on similar mechanisms, it is inferred that ABCC2 likely has a significant pharmacogenetic relationship with Capreomycin, influencing its pharmacokinetics and therapeutic outcomes."

    {
        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "ABCB1 encodes the P-glycoprotein, a crucial player in the pharmacokinetics of numerous medications. It acts as an efflux transporter that modifies the absorption, distribution, and excretion of various drugs. Given its broad scope of function, ABCB1 could plausibly influence the pharmacokinetics of Capreomycin, affecting the drug's bioavailability and penetration in different tissues, potentially leading to variable treatment outcomes."

    {
        "gene": "ABCC3",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "The ABCC3 gene significantly influences the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of various drugs, including antitubercular drugs. It primarily affects drug transport, and variants in ABCC3 can lead to altered excretion and hence the effectiveness and side effects of drugs including Capreomycin. Apart from pharmacokinetic influence, ABCC3 also has pharmacodynamic efficacy that may interact with Capreomycin, aligning with the reported auxiliary information."

    {
        "gene": "ABCC4",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "ABCC4 gene variants influence the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of various drugs, including those used against mycobacteria like Capreomycin. It functions by modulating the efflux of these drugs from cells, impacting drug concentrations and hence their pharmacological effectiveness. Potential alterations in ABCC4 functioning due to genetic variations can foster variable therapy outcomes and drug resistance."

    {
        "gene": "ABCG2",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "ABCG2, an efflux transporter, influences the pharmacokinetics of various drugs by modifying their absorption, distribution and excretion. Genetic variants within this gene could modify drug interactions with Capreomycin, potentially affecting its therapeutic efficacy and safety. Genetic variations like Q141K in the ABCG2 gene can cause alterations in the pharmacokinetics of Capreomycin affecting therapeutic outcomes."

    {
        "gene": "SLC22A16",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "SLC22A16 is known to play a significant role in the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin by impacting its transport and potentially impacts the pharmacokinetics of other drugs as well. Given this established role in modulating the transport of chemotherapy drugs, it is reasonable to propose a potential pharmacogenetic interaction with Capreomycin, where genetic variants in SLC22A16 could affect the absorption, distribution, or excretion of Capreomycin, potentially altering its therapeutic efficacy or increasing risk of toxicities."

    {
        "gene": "MT-RNR1",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "Capreomycin, like other aminoglycosides, may affect the protein synthesis in cochlear cells, leading to ototoxicity. If this ototoxicity is driven by the high sensitivity of the mitochondrial ribosomes to the drug, the genetic variations in MT-RNR1 may have a significant impact on the susceptibility to aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss. Thus, MT-RNR1 might have a pharmacogenetic relationship with Capreomycin, influencing its ototoxic potential."

    {
        "gene": "SLCO1B1",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "SLCO1B1 gene, which encodes a protein involved in hepatic drug uptake, is a likely contender for having a pharmacogenetic relationship with Capreomycin. Genetic variations in SLCO1B1 can alter the drug's plasma concentrations, potentially leading to increased toxicity and altered therapeutic efficacy of Capreomycin. Thus, these genetic variations could have a substantial impact on the pharmacokinetics of Capreomycin."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCC5",
        "rank": 9,
        "explanation": "ABCC5, an efflux transporter gene, impacts the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of several drugs. It notably alters the toxicity profile and the bioavailability of drugs, including potentially Capreomycin. Genetic variations leading to variable ABCC5 activity can influence Capreomycin levels and thus its therapeutic efficacy or adverse effects."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCB7",
        "rank": 10,
        "explanation": "Although the ABCB7 gene might not directly interact with Capreomycin, considering its role in cellular transport processes, it's likely that it could influence the excretion of Capreomycin or Capreomycin-induced physiological responses, altering the drug efficacy and safety profile of Capreomycin."
