        "gene": "CYP3A4",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "CYP3A4 gene has crucial pharmacogenetic implications for Bedaquiline. The drug's effectiveness and safety are significantly modulated by variations in the CYP3A4 gene, affecting its metabolism. Individuals with genetic variants enhancing or reducing CYP3A4 enzyme activity may experience either reduced efficacy or heightened risk of adverse effects like QT prolongation. This consequently necessitates consideration of dose adjustment or thorough monitoring, to balance the therapeutic benefits and risks."

    {
        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "ABCB1 encodes P-glycoprotein which is vital in modulating the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of Bedaquiline. It acts as an efflux transporter, influencing the absorption, distribution, and elimination of the drug. Importantly, ABCB1 can impact the bioavailability and cellular concentration of drugs. Thus, variations in the ABCB1 gene that modify transporter function may affect drug efficacy and toxicity."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP3A5",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "Beyond its relationship with CYP3A4, Bedaquiline may also interact with the CYP3A5 enzymatic pathway, considering their shared roles in drug metabolism. Variants in the CYP3A5 gene that alters enzyme activity can affect the metabolism rates of Bedaquiline, which in turn can influence its therapeutic outcomes and risk profiles."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2D6",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "CYP2D6 plays a critical role in metabolizing various drugs. Although no direct association of CYP2D6 with Bedaquiline is established, considering the enzyme\u2019s broad substrate specificity, there are possible interactions that may affect the pharmacokinetics of Bedaquiline."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCC1",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "ABCC1, encoding for an efflux transporter, affects the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of various drugs, impacting their absorption, distribution, and elimination. Similar to ABCB1, it could modulate the cellular clearance and concentration of Bedaquiline, affecting drug effectiveness and toxicity."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C19",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "CYP2C19 enzymatic pathway significantly influences the metabolism of various clinically relevant drugs. Therefore, it could potentially interact with pharmacokinetic processes related to Bedaquiline. Understanding its influence may provide valuable insights into optimizing the drug's therapeutic efficacy while minimizing side effects."
    },
    {
        "gene": "UGT1A1",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "UGT1A1 is crucial for glucuronidation, a major phase II metabolic pathway. Variations in UGT1A1 can impact drug metabolism, affecting both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and potentially contribute in tunnelling the metabolic shunts of Bedaquiline."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCC2",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "ABCC2 gene variants influence the function of MRP2 protein affecting the pharmacokinetics of various drugs. As with ABCB1 and ABCC1, it might modulate the cellular clearance and concentration of Bedaquiline, influencing drug effectiveness and toxicity."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2B6",
        "rank": 9,
        "explanation": "Although the interaction between CYP2B6 and Bedaquiline is not well-documented, given CYP2B6\u2019s role in the metabolism of a diversity of drugs, there are potential pharmacokinetic interactions that could affect the efficacy and safety of Bedaquiline therapy."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C9",
        "rank": 10,
        "explanation": "CYP2C9 significantly affects the metabolism of various drugs. Though not directly associated with the metabolism of Bedaquiline, its potential influence on pharmacokinetic processes related to the drug merits consideration due to its broad substrate specificity."
