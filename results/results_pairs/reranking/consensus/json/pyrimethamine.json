        "gene": "CYP2C19",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "CYP2C19 notably influences the metabolism of a significant spectrum of drugs, impacting therapeutic efficacy and safety, with recognised variations in the gene affecting drug metabolism and thus leading to differing pharmacological outcomes. Pyrimethamine, classified as an antimalarial medication, although not identified as a conventional substrate of this gene, it could theoretically interact with CYP2C19 due to its similar metabolic pathway to named CYP2C19-metabolized drugs."

    {
        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "ABCB1, encoding P-glycoprotein and modulates pharmacokinetics and efficacy of multiple drugs, influences absorption, distribution, and excretion. It possesses clinical relevance with drugs having marked bioavailability and brain penetration. Given that pyrimethamine is used in treating infections of the central nervous system, it's plausible to hypothesize that ABCB1 might also be involved in the transport of pyrimethamine."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2C8",
        "rank": 3,
        "explanation": "The CYP2C8 gene encodes the Cytochrome P450 2C8 enzyme, which is a key element involved in the metabolism of pyrimethamine. Polymorphisms in this gene may significantly alter the efficacy and toxicity of pyrimethamine by modulating drug metabolism and exposure levels. This would make dose adjustment potentially necessary to avoid adverse drug reactions and to achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes."
    },
    {
        "gene": "SLC22A1",
        "rank": 4,
        "explanation": "SLC22A1, affecting hepatic drug uptake, could potentially impact pyrimethamine's pharmacokinetics and efficacy. Variants in SLC22A1 could result in different pharmacological outcomes, and considering its role in drug transport, it may be relevant in the context of pyrimethamine."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCG2",
        "rank": 5,
        "explanation": "Similar to ABCB1, ABCG2 is a gene encoding for an efflux transporter that significantly influences pharmacokinetics of various drugs by altering their absorption, distribution, and excretion. Given the similar pharmacokinetics among ABC transporters-substrate drugs, it is feasible that ABCG2 may have a pharmacogenetic interaction with pyrimethamine."
    },
    {
        "gene": "G6PD",
        "rank": 6,
        "explanation": "G6PD variants could influence treatment responses in parasitic infections. Given that Pyrimethamine is used to treat malaria, a parasitic infection, this gene does have a pharmacogenetic relationship with the drug of interest. Variations in this gene could alter the response to Pyrimethamine, particularly in individuals with G6PD deficiency."
    },
    {
        "gene": "IKBKG",
        "rank": 7,
        "explanation": "Mutations in the IKBKG gene, which affects the NF-kappaB signaling pathway that is crucial in immune responses, can potentially influence the efficacy of pyrimethamine in treating certain parasitic infections. It may alter the immune system's response to infections, ultimately influencing the therapeutic efficacy of pyrimethamine."
    },
    {
        "gene": "CYP2D6",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "CYP2D6 is known to significantly impact the metabolism of various drugs. Although its involvement in pyrimethamine metabolism is not yet established, considering its broad impact on drug metabolism, CYP2D6 may influence pyrimethamine's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics."
    },
    {
        "gene": "SLCO1B1",
        "rank": 9,
        "explanation": "SLCO1B1 influences the hepatic uptake of drugs. Pyrimethamine's pharmacogenetics more so concerns transport and metabolism, both functions that SLCO1B1 could potentially affect. Genetic polymorphisms could thus have an impact on Pyrimethamine's pharmacokinetics."
    },
    {
        "gene": "ABCC2",
        "rank": 10,
        "explanation": "As a gene encoding MRP2 protein, ABCC2 influences pharmacokinetics and therapeutic outcomes of various drugs. The protein encoded by this gene is involved in the excretion process of drugs like methotrexate and can potentially mimic similar interactions with pyrimethamine, influencing its therapeutic efficacy and toxicity through MRP2 relevant pathways."
