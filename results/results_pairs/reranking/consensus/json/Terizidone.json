        "gene": "ABCC2",
        "rank": 1,
        "explanation": "Considering Terizidone's auxiliary information, drugs interacting with this compound potentially rely heavily on metabolism via aldehyde dehydrogenases and transport via ABC transporters like ABCC2 for efficacy and safety. ABCC2, also known as MRP2, affects various drugs' pharmacokinetic profiles. Mutations in this gene can alter drug excretion and plasma concentrations, leading to changes in drug effectiveness and toxicity. Specifically, for Terizidone, interaction with ABCC2 might influence the drug's distribution and excretion, hence possibly affecting its therapeutic outcomes."

        "gene": "ABCB1",
        "rank": 2,
        "explanation": "Based on the provided information on Terizidone, ABCB1 might significantly influence the drug's pharmacokinetics. ABCB1, also known as P-glycoprotein, is fundamental in modulating the absorption, distribution, and excretion of multiple drugs, thereby affecting their bioavailability. For Terizidone, interaction with ABCB1 could alter its absorption and distribution, possibly influencing its therapeutic effectiveness and the required dosage."

        "gene": "G6PD",
        "rank": 8,
        "explanation": "The G6PD gene might have an indirect pharmacogenetic interaction with Terizidone. G6PD deficiency makes individuals susceptible to exacerbated hemolysis due to certain medications' oxidative stress effects. While the exact interaction mechanism with Terizidone is not straightforward, if Terizidone causes oxidative stress in cells, it could potentially trigger hemolytic reactions in G6PD-deficient individuals."
