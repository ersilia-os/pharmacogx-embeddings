Additionally, the transporter gene ABCB1 affects its distribution and excretion, while non-enzymatic factors such as G6PD deficiency impact the risk of hemolysis in treated patients, illustrating a complex interaction between genetic factors and chloroquine's pharmacological effects.

# Auxiliary information about the genes
Below is some auxiliary information about the genes in the pre-ranked list:
**CYP2D6**: CYP2D6 enzyme is crucial in metabolizing drugs, including codeine, antidepressants like paroxetine and fluoxetine, the antipsychotic risperidone, tamoxifen, and beta-blockers such as metoprolol and timolol, with genetic variations influencing their plasma levels and effects. Differences in CYP2D6 activity can lead to different therapeutic outcomes, with poor metabolizers experiencing potential toxicity and ultrarapid metabolizers having reduced drug efficacy, making pharmacogenetic knowledge essential for adjusting dosages or choosing alternative therapies to optimize treatment efficacy and safety.

**CYP2D7**: CYP2D7, a pseudogene, does not encode a functional enzyme and thus does not partake in the metabolism of drugs, unlike its close relative CYP2D6, which metabolizes about 25% of clinically used drugs such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, beta-blockers, and opioids. Although CYP2D7 does not directly interact with these drugs, its similarity to CYP2D6 makes its study important for ensuring accurate pharmacogenetic testing and understanding genetic misannotations which can affect drug dosing and therapy.
