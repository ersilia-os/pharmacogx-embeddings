Genetic variations in CYP2B6 affect the enzyme activity, leading to differences in drug plasma concentrations, therapeutic effects, and potential adverse reactions in individuals, underscoring its importance in personalized medicine.

**ABCB1**: The ABCB1 gene, encoding P-glycoprotein, is crucial in modulating the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of multiple drugs by acting as an efflux transporter that influences their absorption, distribution, and excretion. This gene affects the bioavailability and brain penetration of various drugs such as antivirals like efavirenz and ritonavir, chemotherapeutics like doxorubicin and paclitaxel, cardiovascular drugs like digoxin, immunosuppressants such as tacrolimus and sirolimus, and analgesics like morphine and codeine, necessitating dosage adjustments and careful monitoring in clinical practice for optimized therapeutic outcomes.

**CYP2D7**: CYP2D7, a pseudogene, does not encode a functional enzyme and thus does not partake in the metabolism of drugs, unlike its close relative CYP2D6, which metabolizes about 25% of clinically used drugs such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, beta-blockers, and opioids. Although CYP2D7 does not directly interact with these drugs, its similarity to CYP2D6 makes its study important for ensuring accurate pharmacogenetic testing and understanding genetic misannotations which can affect drug dosing and therapy.

**ABCC2**: ABCC2 gene variants influence the function of the MRP2 protein, affecting the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic outcomes of various drugs. For example, genetic variations like c.1249G>A and c.3972C>T can alter the excretion and plasma concentrations of drugs such as methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, rosuvastatin, and others including irinotecan and docetaxel, thereby impacting drug effectiveness and toxicity. Non-pharmacokinetic interactions involve drugs like clopidogrel and sorafenib, which may affect therapeutic outcomes through MRP2-related pathways.
