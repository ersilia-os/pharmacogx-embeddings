These interactions likely result from HLA-G enhancing immune evasion capabilities in cancer cells, thereby potentially modifying the therapeutic efficacy of the mentioned drugs.

**HLA-A**: The HLA-A gene is crucial in pharmacogenetic interactions due to its role in immune-mediated hypersensitivity reactions to certain drugs. For instance, the HLA-A*31:01 allele increases the risk of severe skin reactions to carbamazepine, while the HLA-A*02:01 allele is linked to severe adverse reactions to allopurinol, both through mechanisms involving the immune system's response to these drugs or their metabolites. Other drugs such as abacavir, phenytoin, and flucloxacillin among others are also implicated in similar immune responses based on the HLA-A gene variations, affecting drug pharmacodynamics rather than pharmacokinetics.

These interactions emphasize the role of HLA-DQB1 in pharmacodynamics, affecting drug safety and efficacy rather than drug metabolism.

**HLA-E**: The gene HLA-E, which plays a significant role in immune system regulation, may interact pharmacodynamically with methotrexate, a drug used for autoimmune diseases and cancer. This interaction likely occurs as methotrexate modulates immune responses that are under the control of HLA-E, affecting drug efficacy and potential adverse effects rather than affecting the drug's absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion.

**CYP2A7**: CYP2A7, a lesser-known member of the cytochrome P450 family, does not have well-established pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs like mercaptopurine, although it might theoretically affect mercaptopurine's metabolism similarly to its related isoform, CYP2A6. The interaction and impact of CYP2A7 on the metabolism of mercaptopurine are speculative and require further evidence, as mercaptopurine is primarily metabolized through other pathways involving TPMT and XO.

**CYP2D7**: CYP2D7, a pseudogene, does not encode a functional enzyme and thus does not partake in the metabolism of drugs, unlike its close relative CYP2D6, which metabolizes about 25% of clinically used drugs such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, beta-blockers, and opioids. Although CYP2D7 does not directly interact with these drugs, its similarity to CYP2D6 makes its study important for ensuring accurate pharmacogenetic testing and understanding genetic misannotations which can affect drug dosing and therapy.

**NAT2**: The NAT2 gene encodes an enzyme crucial for the metabolism of various drugs through N-acetylation, influencing their pharmacokinetics and toxicity. Variants in NAT2 affect the metabolism of drugs like isoniazid, hydralazine, procainamide, sulfamethoxazole, and pyrazinamide, leading to differences in acetylator status (rapid, intermediate, slow) among individuals, which impacts drug plasma levels, exposure duration, and risk of adverse effects such as increased toxicity and drug-induced lupus.

Although it does not metabolize nicotine directly, CYP2A13 affects the activation of other smoke components that interact with nicotine's pathway, potentially influencing nicotine addiction and cancer risks, with genetic variations in CYP2A13 altering susceptibility to these effects.

**ALOX5AP**: Variations in the ALOX5AP gene can alter the levels of leukotrienes it produces, impacting the effectiveness of leukotriene receptor antagonists like montelukast and zafirlukast, used for treating asthma and allergic rhinitis. Additionally, ALOX5AP might influence the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine, a relationship that is not yet well understood and deviates from the gene's known functions in leukotriene biosynthesis.

**ABCC5**: ABCC5, an efflux transporter gene, influences the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of several drugs, notably altering the bioavailability and systemic toxicity of doxorubicin, a key cancer chemotherapy drug. Other drugs such as glyburide, leucovorin, cannabidiol, irinotecan, and fluorouracil are also likely affected by ABCC5's capacity to modulate drug levels, either impacting their therapeutic efficacy or altering their toxicity profile.

**UGT2B4**: The UGT2B4 gene is crucial in the metabolism and excretion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) by converting them into water-soluble glucuronide conjugates, impacting their clearance and action duration. Variations in this gene affect the drug levels in the body, influencing the efficacy and safety of NSAID treatments, potentially leading to reduced effectiveness or an increased risk of adverse effects like gastrointestinal bleeding.
