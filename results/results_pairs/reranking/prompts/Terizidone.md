These interactions emphasize the role of HLA-DQB1 in pharmacodynamics, affecting drug safety and efficacy rather than drug metabolism.

**HLA-E**: The gene HLA-E, which plays a significant role in immune system regulation, may interact pharmacodynamically with methotrexate, a drug used for autoimmune diseases and cancer. This interaction likely occurs as methotrexate modulates immune responses that are under the control of HLA-E, affecting drug efficacy and potential adverse effects rather than affecting the drug's absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion.

**CYP2A7**: CYP2A7, a lesser-known member of the cytochrome P450 family, does not have well-established pharmacogenetic interactions with drugs like mercaptopurine, although it might theoretically affect mercaptopurine's metabolism similarly to its related isoform, CYP2A6. The interaction and impact of CYP2A7 on the metabolism of mercaptopurine are speculative and require further evidence, as mercaptopurine is primarily metabolized through other pathways involving TPMT and XO.

**CYP2D7**: CYP2D7, a pseudogene, does not encode a functional enzyme and thus does not partake in the metabolism of drugs, unlike its close relative CYP2D6, which metabolizes about 25% of clinically used drugs such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, beta-blockers, and opioids. Although CYP2D7 does not directly interact with these drugs, its similarity to CYP2D6 makes its study important for ensuring accurate pharmacogenetic testing and understanding genetic misannotations which can affect drug dosing and therapy.

Although it does not metabolize nicotine directly, CYP2A13 affects the activation of other smoke components that interact with nicotine's pathway, potentially influencing nicotine addiction and cancer risks, with genetic variations in CYP2A13 altering susceptibility to these effects.

**ALOX5AP**: Variations in the ALOX5AP gene can alter the levels of leukotrienes it produces, impacting the effectiveness of leukotriene receptor antagonists like montelukast and zafirlukast, used for treating asthma and allergic rhinitis. Additionally, ALOX5AP might influence the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine, a relationship that is not yet well understood and deviates from the gene's known functions in leukotriene biosynthesis.

**ABCC5**: ABCC5, an efflux transporter gene, influences the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of several drugs, notably altering the bioavailability and systemic toxicity of doxorubicin, a key cancer chemotherapy drug. Other drugs such as glyburide, leucovorin, cannabidiol, irinotecan, and fluorouracil are also likely affected by ABCC5's capacity to modulate drug levels, either impacting their therapeutic efficacy or altering their toxicity profile.

**UGT2B4**: The UGT2B4 gene is crucial in the metabolism and excretion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) by converting them into water-soluble glucuronide conjugates, impacting their clearance and action duration.
