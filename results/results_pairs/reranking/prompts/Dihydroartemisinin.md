**CYP2B6**: CYP2B6 plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of several drugs, including efavirenz, nevirapine, methadone, bupropion, cyclophosphamide, and ifosfamide, where genetic polymorphisms can significantly influence drug efficacy and safety by altering pharmacokinetic profiles. Genetic variations in CYP2B6 affect the enzyme activity, leading to differences in drug plasma concentrations, therapeutic effects, and potential adverse reactions in individuals, underscoring its importance in personalized medicine.

**CYP2D6**: CYP2D6 enzyme is crucial in metabolizing drugs, including codeine, antidepressants like paroxetine and fluoxetine, the antipsychotic risperidone, tamoxifen, and beta-blockers such as metoprolol and timolol, with genetic variations influencing their plasma levels and effects. Differences in CYP2D6 activity can lead to different therapeutic outcomes, with poor metabolizers experiencing potential toxicity and ultrarapid metabolizers having reduced drug efficacy, making pharmacogenetic knowledge essential for adjusting dosages or choosing alternative therapies to optimize treatment efficacy and safety.

**CYP2D7**: CYP2D7, a pseudogene, does not encode a functional enzyme and thus does not partake in the metabolism of drugs, unlike its close relative CYP2D6, which metabolizes about 25% of clinically used drugs such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, beta-blockers, and opioids. Although CYP2D7 does not directly interact with these drugs, its similarity to CYP2D6 makes its study important for ensuring accurate pharmacogenetic testing and understanding genetic misannotations which can affect drug dosing and therapy.

**ABCB1**: The ABCB1 gene, encoding P-glycoprotein, is crucial in modulating the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of multiple drugs by acting as an efflux transporter that influences their absorption, distribution, and excretion. This gene affects the bioavailability and brain penetration of various drugs such as antivirals like efavirenz and ritonavir, chemotherapeutics like doxorubicin and paclitaxel, cardiovascular drugs like digoxin, immunosuppressants such as tacrolimus and sirolimus, and analgesics like morphine and codeine, necessitating dosage adjustments and careful monitoring in clinical practice for optimized therapeutic outcomes.

Genetic variations in CYP11B2 can lead to alterations in the pharmacodynamic interactions with these medications, which can vary their efficacy and side effect profiles in treating cardiovascular conditions.

**BLVRB**: Drugs that induce hemolysis increase biliverdin levels, thereby intensifying the function of BLVRB in converting biliverdin to bilirubin; variations in the BLVRB gene may affect how patients respond to such drugs, especially given this gene's role in managing bilirubin levels to prevent complications like jaundice. Moreover, drugs that modulate oxidative stress could indirectly influence BLVRB function, thereby affecting its role in maintaining redox homeostasis.

**UGT2B4**: The UGT2B4 gene is crucial in the metabolism and excretion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) by converting them into water-soluble glucuronide conjugates, impacting their clearance and action duration. Variations in this gene affect the drug levels in the body, influencing the efficacy and safety of NSAID treatments, potentially leading to reduced effectiveness or an increased risk of adverse effects like gastrointestinal bleeding.

**TBXAS1**: Aspirin, an antiplatelet drug, indirectly reduces the activity of TBXAS1, a gene essential for thromboxane A2 production, by inhibiting COX-1 which decreases substrate availability for TBXAS1. Variations in TBXAS1 can therefore affect the drug's efficacy in preventing thrombotic events by altering the responsiveness of thromboxane A2 levels to aspirin therapy.

**CYP11B1**: The CYP11B1 gene's role in corticosteroid biosynthesis impacts the pharmacokinetics of drugs like metyrapone, which inhibits CYP11B1 to reduce cortisol production, useful in treating conditions like Cushing's syndrome. Variations in the CYP11B1 gene can affect metyrapone's effectiveness and tolerability by altering enzyme expression or activity, highlighting the importance of considering genetic differences in treatment plans involving corticosteroid imbalances.
