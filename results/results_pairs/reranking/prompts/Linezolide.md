**CYP3A43**: The gene CYP3A43, although not a major player in drug metabolism compared to other enzymes in its subfamily, is known to have specific pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs like olanzapine and ticagrelor, influencing their clearance and plasma concentrations to a minor degree. Its interactions with other antipsychotic drugs such as quetiapine, haloperidol, aripiprazole, risperidone, and clozapine are less defined and are likely related to broader metabolic pathways or pharmacodynamic responses, where CYP3A43 plays a marginal role.

**NR1I2**: NR1I2, or pregnane X receptor (PXR), regulates genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes and transport systems like CYP3A4 and MDR1, influencing the pharmacokinetics of various drugs. Activators of NR1I2 such as rifampin and carbamazepine can increase the metabolism and decrease the efficacy of drugs like sirolimus and rosuvastatin by upregulating CYP3A4, while inhibitors can slow metabolism, increasing toxicity risk.

**CYP4B1**: CYP4B1, which is involved in the metabolism of fatty acids and xenobiotics, may potentially interact with drugs like docetaxel and thalidomide due to their structural similarities to fatty acids. This interaction could alter the pharmacokinetics of these drugs, affecting their efficacy and safety, although direct evidence of this is currently limited.

**HLA-A**: The HLA-A gene is crucial in pharmacogenetic interactions due to its role in immune-mediated hypersensitivity reactions to certain drugs. For instance, the HLA-A*31:01 allele increases the risk of severe skin reactions to carbamazepine, while the HLA-A*02:01 allele is linked to severe adverse reactions to allopurinol, both through mechanisms involving the immune system's response to these drugs or their metabolites. Other drugs such as abacavir, phenytoin, and flucloxacillin among others are also implicated in similar immune responses based on the HLA-A gene variations, affecting drug pharmacodynamics rather than pharmacokinetics.

**FMO4**: The FMO4 gene encodes for the enzyme flavin-containing monooxygenase 4, which potentially contributes to the metabolism of drugs by affecting their pharmacokinetics, altering plasma drug levels, and impacting therapeutic outcomes or side effects. The exact drugs impacted by FMO4 are still speculative, as FMO4’s interactions with specific drugs are currently not well-documented and remain under research.

**HLA-B**: The HLA-B gene plays a crucial role in drug hypersensitivity reactions through allele-specific interactions, such as the HLA-B*57:01 allele causing severe reactions to abacavir and the HLA-B*15:02 allele being associated with severe adverse reactions to carbamazepine. These interactions, which involve the immune system's response to drug-modified peptides or the drug itself presented by the HLA-B protein, emphasize the importance of genetic testing in precision medicine to tailor drug therapy and minimize adverse reactions based on individual genetic profiles.

**ALOX5AP**: Variations in the ALOX5AP gene can alter the levels of leukotrienes it produces, impacting the effectiveness of leukotriene receptor antagonists like montelukast and zafirlukast, used for treating asthma and allergic rhinitis. Additionally, ALOX5AP might influence the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine, a relationship that is not yet well understood and deviates from the gene's known functions in leukotriene biosynthesis.

**CYP4F11**: The enzyme CYP4F11 is involved in the metabolism of drugs such as warfarin, aspirin, and erlotinib, influencing their effectiveness and safety by altering degradation rates, plasma levels, therapeutic efficacy, and the profile of side effects.
