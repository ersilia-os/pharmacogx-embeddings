Additionally, polymorphisms in the ABCB1 gene impact the drug's distribution and elimination, while genetic factors like G6PD deficiency can enhance sensitivity to oxidative stress induced by malaria, all of which potentially modify the therapeutic outcomes and side effects of mefloquine.

# Auxiliary information about the genes
Below is some auxiliary information about the genes in the pre-ranked list:
**CYP2D6**: CYP2D6 enzyme is crucial in metabolizing drugs, including codeine, antidepressants like paroxetine and fluoxetine, the antipsychotic risperidone, tamoxifen, and beta-blockers such as metoprolol and timolol, with genetic variations influencing their plasma levels and effects. Differences in CYP2D6 activity can lead to different therapeutic outcomes, with poor metabolizers experiencing potential toxicity and ultrarapid metabolizers having reduced drug efficacy, making pharmacogenetic knowledge essential for adjusting dosages or choosing alternative therapies to optimize treatment efficacy and safety.

**CYP2D7**: CYP2D7, a pseudogene, does not encode a functional enzyme and thus does not partake in the metabolism of drugs, unlike its close relative CYP2D6, which metabolizes about 25% of clinically used drugs such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, beta-blockers, and opioids. Although CYP2D7 does not directly interact with these drugs, its similarity to CYP2D6 makes its study important for ensuring accurate pharmacogenetic testing and understanding genetic misannotations which can affect drug dosing and therapy.

**CYP3A4**: CYP3A4, significantly expressed in the liver and small intestine, influences the metabolism and thus the effects and toxicity of many drugs, including tacrolimus, statins like atorvastatin and lovastatin, chemotherapeutics such as docetaxel, and sedatives like midazolam. Interaction with inducers or inhibitors like carbamazepine and erythromycin respectively can either increase or decrease CYP3A4's activity, affecting the metabolism of other drugs such as sildenafil and necessitating dosage adjustments due to changes in pharmacokinetic profiles.

**ABCB1**: The ABCB1 gene, encoding P-glycoprotein, is crucial in modulating the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of multiple drugs by acting as an efflux transporter that influences their absorption, distribution, and excretion. This gene affects the bioavailability and brain penetration of various drugs such as antivirals like efavirenz and ritonavir, chemotherapeutics like doxorubicin and paclitaxel, cardiovascular drugs like digoxin, immunosuppressants such as tacrolimus and sirolimus, and analgesics like morphine and codeine, necessitating dosage adjustments and careful monitoring in clinical practice for optimized therapeutic outcomes.

**G6PD**: Certain medications exacerbate hemolysis in individuals with G6PD deficiency due to their effects on oxidative stress and redox balance within cells. Notably, antimalarials like primaquine and chloroquine, antibiotics such as dapsone, sulfasalazine, and sulfamethoxazole, NSAIDs including aspirin and ibuprofen, and potentially diabetic medications like gliclazide and glimepiride, as well as anticoagulants such as warfarin, can precipitate hemolytic reactions, necessitating careful management to avoid these drugs in affected individuals.

It indirectly influences drug metabolism, such as with metformin, by potentially altering the metabolic environment or modifying intermediate biomolecules, thus affecting the drug's efficacy and safety through non-traditional pathways related to its handling of metabolic byproducts connected to sulfur and nitrogen.

**ABCB4**: ABCB4 mutations, which alter the function of the MDR3 protein, can impact the pharmacokinetics of the drug imatinib, used for treating chronic myeloid leukemia, by affecting the drug's transport and disposition in hepatocytes. This interaction may change the drug’s effectiveness and increase the risk of drug-induced liver injury (DILI), highlighting the potential importance of considering ABCB4 gene variations in personalized dosing or therapy for optimal treatment outcomes and reduced liver complication risks.

**CYP2C18**: CYP2C18 plays a modest role in the metabolism of drugs like warfarin, escitalopram, and clozapine, mainly affecting their clearance or efficacy to a lesser extent than more prominent CYP enzymes. Genetic variations in CYP2C18 could influence the pharmacodynamics of drugs such as clopidogrel and acenocoumarol, rather than their pharmacokinetic profiles, indicating a potential need for personalized medicine considerations despite the enzyme's relative minor role.

**CYP3A43**: The gene CYP3A43, although not a major player in drug metabolism compared to other enzymes in its subfamily, is known to have specific pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs like olanzapine and ticagrelor, influencing their clearance and plasma concentrations to a minor degree. Its interactions with other antipsychotic drugs such as quetiapine, haloperidol, aripiprazole, risperidone, and clozapine are less defined and are likely related to broader metabolic pathways or pharmacodynamic responses, where CYP3A43 plays a marginal role.

**CYP2E1**: The gene CYP2E1 significantly impacts the metabolism of various drugs; for instance, in the case of acetaminophen and isoniazid, variations in CYP2E1 activity can lead to differences in the rate at which these drugs are metabolized, thereby affecting their efficacy, toxicity, and risk of adverse effects such as hepatotoxicity. Additionally, CYP2E1 metabolizes other substances like caffeine, theophylline, nicotine, and some procarcinogens, indicating that genetic variations could influence both therapeutic outcomes and disease risk through pharmacokinetic and possibly pharmacodynamic interactions.

**CYP2J2**: CYP2J2, primarily involved in metabolizing polyunsaturated fatty acids affecting cardiovascular physiology, does not have well-documented direct pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs like mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus. However, its role in modulating vascular tone and inflammation could potentially influence the pharmacodynamics of these immunosuppressive drugs used in organ transplantation and autoimmune diseases, despite the lack of a direct metabolic pathway involving CYP2J2.

**CYP3A7**: The CYP3A7 enzyme, important in fetal liver metabolism, interacts with drugs like atorvastatin and tacrolimus by potentially altering their pharmacokinetic profiles and systemic exposure during fetal development due to its activity in metabolizing these CYP3A substrates. Additionally, corticosteroids such as betamethasone and cortisone acetate may also interact with CYP3A7, affecting their metabolic rates and therapeutic outcomes in neonates and infants, though the specific pathway (pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic) of these interactions is less defined.

**CYP1A1**: CYP1A1, an important enzyme in drug metabolism, exhibits pharmacogenetic interactions that impact the efficacy and toxicity of drugs like theophylline and clozapine through variations in metabolic activity based on genetic differences.
